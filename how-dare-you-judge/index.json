Pretty much nothing of any importance that I can think of..\n\nOh well.. yeah I did get married.. but other than that..\n\n<img src=\"/images/photos/wedding/wedding_example1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class='pull-right' />\n\nI finally tied the knot!  And wow did I ever luck out..  On June 2nd 2007 in sunny Las Vegas, I managed to sucker..er marry the lovely and talented Melissa Gail Perkins.  She's now Melissa Ellis.. hehe.. Though she hasn't changed her name yet.. =p  Can't say as I blame her either - holy crap that's a pain in the ass.. (Not the marriage, the name changing..)\n\nEverything was very nice.. And I'm an extremely lucky man.. I love Melissa very much and am tickled to call her my wife.. I very much look forward to spending the rest of my days with this wonderful woman..  (And no she didn't make me say this.. )\n\nMelissa looked awesome in her dress!  We actually went through a lot to keep the dress completely hidden from me until they opened the doors and she walked down the isle.   Oh man.. what a stunner!  I married a knockout.. how the hell did that happen?!  Clearly her taste in men is in question.. heh She just looked fantastic..\n\nI looked like a fat guy in a rented tux..  Or at least that's how I felt..   It's interesting that for a woman to look good to a man, its usually take clothing off.  But for a man to look good to a woman, it's the other way around.   Unfortunately I don't think I look all that good either way.. heh  Tux or no tux..\nWe have a lot of photo's that we need to get sorted and published to the web so everyone can share.  Still waiting to get some from the family as I think some of them are holding out..\n\nWe even had a video made, but haven't gotten that yet.  Which annoys me somewhat to be honest.. I'm afraid its going to fall off the truck or something..\n\nThe reception dinner was very nice.. the food was good, even our cake was good.  In fact I'd say it was darn good.  I was surprised by that..  We both were completely stuffed by the end of the night - and completely zonked.   Our day had started very early (hers earlier than mine) and it was \"go go go\" all day long. So by the time we finally got done, we were done!   Glad I never have to do that again..heh\n\nI must admit though, if I never go to Vegas again it will be too soon.  The magic of the place has just gone.  In the early 90's when I first went there it was a very different place.  I don't like where it has gone now.

Not much else you can do to burns..\n\nKeeping it submerged in cold water on and off for the first couple of hours makes it not hurt.. and now its just a matter of wiping off the seepage every so often.\n\nIt doesn't hurt at all now.. except when I bump it..

They are desperately trying to save the lives of babies who are powerless to help themselves from being murdered. How can you or anyone else justify the slaughter of these children for the sake of what the parent is going through?\n\n        I have heard of all the arguments of why abortion is just OK to do, but just because there is a law that says you can do it, doesn’t mean that the act is diminished. It is still child murder, and all the justifications in the world can’t change that. You can’t just wish your atrocities away into the cornfield!\n\n\n<i class='icon-star'></i> Jason - Tuesday, Oct 23rd 2007 at 10:15 am\n\n        “Murder” is the crime of unlawfully killing a person especially with malice aforethought. (http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/murder)\n\n        For there to be “murder”, there must be a crime.\n\n        Since abortion is not illegal, it is not a crime — therefore it isn’t murder.\n\n        However, I’ll play your little game. If abortion is murder — what punishment should we hand out to the woman? How much time should she do for that murder?\n\n        The death penalty? Or if she’s answerable to God, then why make it illegal in the first place? I’m fairly certain that God doesn’t need your help. If this is a matter between the woman and God why are you sticking your nose in to it at all? (Oh right.. Christianity.. I forgot..)\n\n        The problem I have is that you’re willing to fight to outlaw abortion, but not fight to ensure good and effective birth control to help prevent conception in the first place. You don’t fight for easy free access to neonatal care, or quicker adoption programs or any other benefit to expecting mothers who don’t want the child — underprivileged or otherwise.\n\n        You could easily advocate all manner of good things from the government to better this situation which you call murder, but you don’t.\n\n        All you give a shit about is the fetus while its in utero. Once it gets its first cry suddenly in your eyes its just another poverty stricken criminal-in-waiting whelpling born of a morally questionable whore and an anonymous baby-daddy that’s stealing money from welfare, not giving back to society and dragging the rest of us down.\n\n        Your narrow minded morality tale doesn’t impress me — you’re only true interest is forcing all of us to live by your mores by any means.

(http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/murder)\n\n        For there to be “murder”, there must be a crime.\n\n        Since abortion is not illegal, it is not a crime — therefore it isn’t murder.\n\n        However, I’ll play your little game. If abortion is murder — what punishment should we hand out to the woman? How much time should she do for that murder?\n\n        The death penalty? Or if she’s answerable to God, then why make it illegal in the first place? I’m fairly certain that God doesn’t need your help. If this is a matter between the woman and God why are you sticking your nose in to it at all? (Oh right.. Christianity.. I forgot..)\n\n        The problem I have is that you’re willing to fight to outlaw abortion, but not fight to ensure good and effective birth control to help prevent conception in the first place. You don’t fight for easy free access to neonatal care, or quicker adoption programs or any other benefit to expecting mothers who don’t want the child — underprivileged or otherwise.\n\n        You could easily advocate all manner of good things from the government to better this situation which you call murder, but you don’t.\n\n        All you give a shit about is the fetus while its in utero. Once it gets its first cry suddenly in your eyes its just another poverty stricken criminal-in-waiting whelpling born of a morally questionable whore and an anonymous baby-daddy that’s stealing money from welfare, not giving back to society and dragging the rest of us down.\n\n        Your narrow minded morality tale doesn’t impress me — you’re only true interest is forcing all of us to live by your mores by any means. Religious fascists by any other name.\n\n        How many children have you adopted?","collection":"posts","url":"/how-dare-you-judge/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2007-08-22-upgrading-woes.md","collection":"posts","url":"/upgrading-woes/","path":"_posts/2007-08-22-upgrading-woes.md","id":"/upgrading-woes","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Upgrading Woes","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2007-08-22 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"upgrading-woes","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2007-08-13-how-dare-you-judge.md","excerpt":"<p>So near where I work there is a Planned Parenthood facility.

That complexity is both it's strength and it's weakness.   It's strength in that, what do you want to do?  You can.   It's weakness in that,  complexity drives people away.  So much so that they would prefer to go use some mind numbing OS that does everything for them. (I give you.. Vista)\n\nThis project has taught me a lot. I'm constantly learning new things, and I feel my knowledge inch up day by day.. even so its an up hill battle for sure.\n\nSo.. in short I want to upgrade WordPress 2.05 to 2.2+ and Invision Power Board 2.17 to 2.3+ but to do that, I have to upgrade MySQL 3.23 to 5.0+ and PHP 4.3 to 5.2+ .\n\nI'd really like to upgrade my Core2 box to something a little more recent .. but thats WAY out of my realm, especially remotely.\n","collection":"posts","url":"/upgrading-woes/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2007-08-22-upgrading-woes.md","collection":"posts","url":"/upgrading-woes/","path":"_posts/2007-08-22-upgrading-woes.md","id":"/upgrading-woes","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Upgrading Woes","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2007-08-22 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"upgrading-woes","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2007-10-11-gutsy-windows-and-portal.md","content":"At work I use just about nothing but Linux.  Even my IBM issued laptop is dual-bootable.. The Linux of choice I have gone with is Ubuntu.. (which only just now got added to Ubuntu's dictionary oddly enough..)  I've been pretty happy with it..  I use Breezy at work, and Edgy on my laptop.  Well I just installed Gutsy on one of my machines at home.\n\nI have always said that as soon as that machine dies, it gets Ubuntu.. It was my primary Email/IM/Webbrowser machine that I just kind of hack around on.  It was always Windows 2000.. but finally with the death of that machines harddrive.. Gutsy!!\n\nAnd so far I love it..  They have turned on many of the 3d effects that were experimental previously and so far they are great!  I had to reinstall xgl to get it to work with my ATI card, but thats largely because ATI drivers suck.   I also had a few issues with my xorg.conf but that has always bit a bit finicky..    For a DEV build of gutsy, I think they have done a good job.\n\nBye bye windows -- well on that machine anyway.  I still have my main game box as windows.. but maybe eventually =)\n\n__Portal__\n\nI have also played, and solved valves new game called Portal.   Holy crap, it's awesome.  It is easily one of the best games I have played in a while.  No mindless killing of the big nasty, just good wholesome puzzles.  Very well done.\n\nThe personality of the game is pure genius.  It walks this amazingly fine line of comedic darkness that is awesome.. The voice over AI \"GLaDis\" is great!  Plus the little sentry guns have funny little sayings that are hilarious.\n\nMy only complaint, and the complaint of everyone who has played it -- is the 3 hours of game play.   That's it.  3 hours.   I solved the game in one sitting.   It was a hell of a lot of fun, and I'm glad I got to do it.. but I wish it were longer..  In fact, I'm sad at how short it was.  But it really opens up the arena for modders and other people to add their own content.\n\nI just hope valve is smart enough to release the portal SDK via steam soon..   Please!!  I want to make some maps.. =)  Mmmm Cake.\n","collection":"posts","url":"/gutsy-windows-and-portal/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2007-10-30-space-submarine.md","collection":"posts","url":"/space-submarine/","path":"_posts/2007-10-30-space-submarine.md","id":"/space-submarine","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Space Submarine!","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2007-10-30 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"space-submarine","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2007-10-11-gutsy-windows-and-portal.md","excerpt":"At work I use just about nothing but Linux.  Even my IBM issued laptop is dual-bootable..
