Oh yes.. You will..\n\n**Frustration Factor** -- The almost constant injection of enemy soldiers in your way turns what would be an extremely fun puzzle game into an even more frustrating set of \"do overs\" as you try to do the same crappy set of objectives over and over again while they shoot at you..  You don't have time to observer the solution 9 times out of 10.. You're just running balls to the wall all the while trying not to be killed..  This sucks.\n\n**Runners Vision** -- The game is supposed to have a system by which you see where you're supposed to go and what you're supposed to do by cleverly placed visual queues in the form of the color red.   Firstly, a big thanks from all us color blind folks.   Secondly,  they don't work 90% of the time until you're standing right on top of them.  So you end up racing towards the unknown away from the guards trying to kill you.  You end up doing it over and over simply because you have no idea where or what you're supposed to be doing..  This sucks.\n\n**Sluggish** -- The input often feels extremely sluggish.  My game would have a solid 60FPS with vsync turned on or over a 100 without and still sometimes it feels like there is a delay in faiths responses to any input.  More over, even though she seems like she is running quickly, often it feels like she is wearing lead boots..\n\n**Single Solutions** -- Many of the \"puzzles\" are a single solution only situation in that if you didn't know to do the exact right thing, you're done.  Put another quarter in, try again.   Example;  if you didn't know to grab the gun and shoot out the window on the third floor of the room you wouldn't be able to jump across to it..  Or if you didn't know how to navigate the building side scaffolding correctly then you die horribly to the helicopter gunship.. or if you don't click the right mouse button at the right microsecond when the big dude is swinging the pipe, then he kills you.    This is just a small example, and really really lame.   These extremely scripted do or die points suck and detract from the game entirely.\n\n**Right Click My Ass** -- The right click grab thing is almost impossible to get working correctly.  I can't tell you the number of times my character was butt stroked to death simply because the 1/20th of a second red queue flashed before I could react.  Or my character was in the middle of a slide or some other action and couldn't react.. etc..\n\nOnce I did get a gun I just about always fell back on to my FPS roots and shot that sucker until empty.  This is sort of contrary to the point of the game, but I felt there was no other way to resolve the situations.\n\nFarther into the game you're confronting what I can only assume is your female counterpart on the roof of a cargo ship.. You're forced to play the \"grab the gun\" game again and this time there is no avoiding her.   You MUST do it to continue the game and it's nearly impossible.  You're only presented the opportunity to do it in rare circumstances and only for 1/20th of a second again.. It was entirely to hard, and the 20 or so deaths I took there made me want to throw in the towel.\n\nOnce I did get past that point I was excited that I finally got to move on, only to be thrust into an impossible chase scene.. Who were the assholes that thought raw frustration was fun?  The computer opponent is able to make jumps that you simpley can't make.. Sorry the cake is a lie.. OR if you can make them it's because you have been playing the game for a year and its second nature to you.. Also, making it timed is just fucking dumb.  If she \"gets too far ahead\" it STARTS YOU OVER!!  okay fuck it.. I'm done.\n\nThis shit isn't fun.  It's frustrating.  It speaks to the fact that the game designers didn't think the puzzle aspect of the game was fun enough when IT WAS!  They had to add all these crappy FPS elements and \"make it more exciting\".. All they succeeded in doing was pissing me off..\n\nI played pretty far through the game and I can say that I think it has a lot of potential.. The way you can interact with the game environment is awesome and every game out there needs to take a hint from it..  But mirrors edge itself isn't fun it's just too hard, and entirely too frustrating.\n\nI may continue to play it a bit, just because I don't want it to beat me.. but I'm not doing it out of enjoyment.. This is the first game that I might finish purely out of spite..\n\n","collection":"posts","url":"/mirrorsedge/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2009-01-18-malygos.md","collection":"posts","url":"/malygos/","path":"_posts/2009-01-18-malygos.md","id":"/malygos","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"25man Malygos","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2009/01/lichking_2-150x150.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-01-18 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"malygos","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2009-01-16-mirrorsedge.md","excerpt":"Mirrors Edge for the PC is a first person action-adventure puzzle game with an extremely compelling story line and quite possibly the most frustrating game play known to man.","id":"/mirrorsedge","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Game Review: Mirrors Edge","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2009/01/faith_of_mirrors_edge-150x150.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-01-16 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"mirrorsedge","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2009-01-18-malygos.md","content":"<img title=\"lichking_2\" src=\"/images/2009/01/lichking_2-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Not Malygos, but a cool pic\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" class='pull-right' />\n\nSo we have been playing a LOT of World of Warcraft of late.  I must admit I'm very much enjoying it for the most part.  But we have gotten to the point where we are farming the end game content because by and large, it's way too easy.\n\nAll that is except Malygos.   We have beaten Malygos before but for whatever reason our guild can't seem to pull it's collective head out 9 times out of 10.  Things just go wrong.\n\nThat's fine and acceptable except they all seem to think we are going to one shot him and move on.

(Or more likely into main memory, then replicated into the graphics card memory.. but thats not important.)  These functions are controlled by windows entirely and out of the games control.  That's why there is writing going on.

Apparently the fan on the graphics card wouldn't correctly auto-increase in speed which meant my graphics card over heated at some point.. (You can download the <a href=\"http://www.evga.com/precision/\" target=\"_blank\">EVGA Precision tool</a> to fix this manually)  Which ultimately meant the memory on my graphics card started to corrupt..

The main issue with it was it routinely operated around 80 degrees Celsius..

Just not in the way they were insisting it was..   What they didn't realize and probably still don't realize was that it wasn't system memory that was causing the corruption.   More over, none of the tests they suggest would have ever revealed any of those issues.\n\nFrom my perspective, my system was working flawlessly because unless a software package actually tried to use any of the faulty memory on the graphics card, everything appeared to work perfectly.

Not because they couldn't come up with a fix, this was a tough one.. but because they were so nonchalant about it and didn't seem to remotely care.\n\nAfter all, I'm just one of eleven million subscribers.. who gives a crap if I'm happy right?\n\nIf you're having #134's, check to make sure your system isn't over heating..  Run the various memory testers, but keep in mind that you have memory on your graphics card that as far as I know, you can't test and it could be the culprit.

Or if there is bad sectors on the hard drive where the pagefile is, same problem.. etc..\n\n__What it actually was;__\n\nWhat they fail to tell you about is.. what if the memory on your graphics card is bad?  That's much harder to test..\n\nMy problem ended up being a bug with the EVGA built nVidia 8800GTX graphics card.  Apparently the fan on the graphics card wouldn't correctly auto-increase in speed which meant my graphics card over heated at some point.. (You can download the <a href=\"http://www.evga.com/precision/\" target=\"_blank\">EVGA Precision tool</a> to fix this manually)  Which ultimately meant the memory on my graphics card started to corrupt.. It only got worse as time went on because the heat problem continued to be an issue, eventually causing the card to die completely.\n\nThe 8800GTX was a great card and it worked for me flawlessly for 2 years before this issue showed up so I can't complain about it at all.. The main issue with it was it routinely operated around 80 degrees Celsius..   With an operational ceiling of 105... that's pretty slim margins and almost begs to overheat..\n\nBut, In a weird way, the blizzard folks were right;  it was a memory issue.  Just not in the way they were insisting it was..   What they didn't realize and probably still don't realize was that it wasn't system memory that was causing the corruption.   More over, none of the tests they suggest would have ever revealed any of those issues.\n\nFrom my perspective, my system was working flawlessly because unless a software package actually tried to use any of the faulty memory on the graphics card, everything appeared to work perfectly.    I still have the 8800gtx card and can plug it into a system right now and so long as you don't try to play a game on it, it works perfectly in windows and linux.\n\nFor me the fix meant I had to replace my graphics card.. I pop'ed the 8800gtx out and installed a <a href=\"http://www.nvidia.com/object/buy_now_results.html?id=GTX285\" target=\"_blank\">nVidia GTX 285</a> and everything works peachy..  My system is back up and happy and so am I.  For a while there I was dreading playing the game because I knew it would crash any second..\n\nMy new card under full load operates at 51ºc (thirty degrees cooler than the 8800 at idle) and all is well...\n\nThe thing I really take out of this is how poorly I was treated by the blizzard support folks.  I'm actually aghast at how bad their support is.  Not because they couldn't come up with a fix, this was a tough one.. but because they were so nonchalant about it and didn't seem to remotely care.\n\nAfter all, I'm just one of eleven million subscribers.. who gives a crap if I'm happy right?\n\nIf you're having #134's, check to make sure your system isn't over heating..  Run the various memory testers, but keep in mind that you have memory on your graphics card that as far as I know, you can't test and it could be the culprit.  If you have tried everything else, try swapping in a new graphics card..\n\nGood luck.\n\n","collection":"posts","url":"/wow134fix/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2009-02-01-game-review-dawn-of-war-2.md","collection":"posts","url":"/game-review-dawn-of-war-2/","path":"_posts/2009-02-01-game-review-dawn-of-war-2.md","id":"/game-review-dawn-of-war-2","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Game Review: Dawn of War 2","layout":"post","tags":["Warhammer","Review"],"image":"/images/2009/02/dawn-of-war-2-1642-150x150.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-02-01 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"game-review-dawn-of-war-2","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2009-01-30-wow134fix.md","excerpt":"It's fixed!  The dreaded 134 Error is no more!   And for the most part the Blizzard tech support people are completely worthless..

So I was extremely excited about Dawn of War, though for whatever reason I didn't get to play it much.\n\nDoW looked very good and I wanted to make sure that I played DoW2!    I wasn't about to let more Warhammer goodness slip by!\n\nDoW2 made by Relic studios uses the same engine that Company of Heroes uses and looks fantastic.   More over, so long as you never actually try to play other people you'll have a great time!    The game is designed to be very fast paced and they have removed the \"build\" element from the game entirely.\n\nIt's pretty clear to me that they have geared this game towards the 16 to 20 year old Korean kids or people with a severe case of ADD as the game plays at a pretty much frantic pace.   Not my style, but I can see why it would be fun.\n\nMore over, I bet if I were actually able to play it multiplayer it would be a cool game..   Oh but I can't.\n\nWhy you ask?\n\nSimple really.. Relic uses the same craptacular network code that Company of Heroes used back in 2006, and as such a good 50% of the game owners out there, can't play it online.  The game always complains of a \"NAT ERROR\".\n\nI can (and do) play other multiplayer games all the time.  I can play GRID, Call of Duty, Battlefield 2142, Left 4 Dead, TFC2..etc.. all multiplayer, all online over the internet and all work just fine.   Yet DoW2 (and Company of Heroes) all say my network is bad.   And I have tried everything right down to plugging my system directly into the modem which generally I think is a bad idea..\n\nMore over, the relic forums have a LOT of folks complaining about this issue.  Since this exact same error has been in effect since CoH was released in 2006.. It's pretty apparent that Relic doesn't give a crap..  And as such, I will not buy this game, and would further ask others to not buy this game.\n\nIf the game developers can refuse to fix a problem that has been plaguing their games for a while (and blame the users instead of their code or code decsisions for the problem), then why should I or any one else buy their game?     You don't reward the dog and say \"good boy\" when he craps on the carpet..  Paying money for something we can't use effectively rewards them for making something that doesn't work.\n\nI wont be buying this game.  The game play gets a 2 1/2 out of 5.. the speed RTS isn't my style but I can see what some would like it, however the removal of the build element completely turns the game into a zerg fest designed to compete with star craft 2 which I don't find fun at all..\n\nThe network thing drags the score down to a 1.  Fix your shit Relic.\n","collection":"posts","url":"/game-review-dawn-of-war-2/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2009-02-01-game-review-dawn-of-war-2.md","collection":"posts","url":"/game-review-dawn-of-war-2/","path":"_posts/2009-02-01-game-review-dawn-of-war-2.md","id":"/game-review-dawn-of-war-2","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Game Review: Dawn of War 2","layout":"post","tags":["Warhammer","Review"],"image":"/images/2009/02/dawn-of-war-2-1642-150x150.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-02-01 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"game-review-dawn-of-war-2","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2009-02-05-windows-7-beta.md","content":"<img title=\"Windows 7\" src=\"/images/2009/02/vista_7_1-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Windows 7\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" class='pull-right' />\n\nI'm generally slow to change operating systems..  When it comes to making one of those sweeping changes, traditionally I was the equivalent of an old man on his porch yelling for \"you kids to get off my lawn!\"   I was a curmudgeon and quite often would refuse to budge.\n\nI didn't switch to Windows 95 until sometime in 97.. I didn't switch to 98 until 99.. I didn't go to NT at all, and stayed on W2k Pro until well after XP was out.  The only reason I went XP was because it was on the new computer I had purchased already..\n\nMy reason for not wanting to upgrade to the newest version of windows was usually because it's painful, the upgrade sucks and quite often I have to go back.  (I wont even go into my Windows ME story.. I had one of the Microsoft Windows ME senior developers tell me to go back to 98 because ME sucked...  Yeah.. It happened..)\n\nMore over upgrading isn't the way to go.. you should wipe fresh and start over..  I usually dreaded this..   What cured that?  Funnily enough, Ubuntu..\n\nI have installed and reinstalled ubuntu so many times I'm an old hat at it..  It's really easy.    So I went into Windows 7 thinking it was going to be back to the pain..  And was pleasantly surprised..\n\nFirstly what Windows 7 isn't;  It isn't a new OS.  Lets be clear here.. Windows 7 is what Vista should have been.  It's more than a reskin to be sure, but mostly it's a refactor of Vista and a general rebranding to get away from the down right awful publicity that Vista rightly deserved..\n\nHaving said that, I like W7 quite a bit actually.  I have had some issues getting my sound card drivers working, but now that I do everything's peachy.   Because it's entirely based on the Vista core just download and install Vista drivers for it and as a rule you're good to go.\n\nThe install process was simple and clean, and since I installed it on a new drive it correctly put the windows bootloader on the main drive (though it did overwrite my grub loader so now I can't get into linux.. will have to add the linux install to windows bootloader..)    The install was fairly quick all things considered, and it configured all my hardware correctly.\n\nI had World of Warcraft up and running within about 3 minutes of installing the OS because I had precopied it to the drive heh.   Yay I have DX10 now!\n\nMy biggest complaint at this point is two fold;  1. the alt+tab functionality seems really slow and clunky in W7.. In XP its instant.. but for whatever reason in W7 it takes a couple seconds.. Minor complaint though really.. it is a beta after all..\n\nSecondly, I want to know what will happen in August when the license expires..  Will I just be screwed and have to reinstall all over again?  They have already stated that you wont be able to install the automatic updates beyond that point and that the OS will die then.. I find that... Odd..\n\nOH well.. I can say that I would likely purchase this OS if it continues to perform as nicely as it does now.  Since it's the premier gaming platform for PC's at this point I don't have much choice.. heh\n\nI still very much like my Mac.. I still very much like Ubuntu.. but the games demand Dx10, so <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">Vista</span>.. er,  Windows 7 it is..\n","collection":"posts","url":"/windows-7-beta/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2009-03-09-game-review-empire-total-war.md","collection":"posts","url":"/game-review-empire-total-war/","path":"_posts/2009-03-09-game-review-empire-total-war.md","id":"/game-review-empire-total-war","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Game Review: Empire: Total War","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2009/03/empire_christmas2007_1024x768-150x150.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-03-09 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"game-review-empire-total-war","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2009-02-05-windows-7-beta.md","excerpt":"I'm generally slow to change operating systems..  When it comes to making one of those sweeping changes, traditionally I was the equivalent of an old man on his porch yelling for \"you kids to get off my lawn!\"   I was a curmudgeon and quite often would refuse to budge.","id":"/windows-7-beta","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Software Review: Windows 7 Beta","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2009/02/vista_7_1-150x150.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-02-05 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"windows-7-beta","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2009-02-01-game-review-dawn-of-war-2.md","excerpt":"I love Warhammer.  I have played Warhammer table top war game both fantasy and 40k pretty much since they came out.  I also have the Warhammer fantasy role playing game, the more recent Warhammer 40k role playing game and gave the Warhammer fantasy MMO a spin.","id":"/game-review-dawn-of-war-2","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Game Review: Dawn of War 2","layout":"post","tags":["Warhammer","Review"],"image":"/images/2009/02/dawn-of-war-2-1642-150x150.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-02-01 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"game-review-dawn-of-war-2","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2009-01-30-wow134fix.md","excerpt":"It's fixed!  The dreaded 134 Error is no more!   And for the most part the Blizzard tech support people are completely worthless..
