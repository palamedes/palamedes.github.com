There are quite a lot of extremely talented folks in the 3D field, and I often dream of being one.\n\nTonight I have embarked on yet another model making adventure -- an attempt to create a very high quality model that actually looks real. In my search for something to create I chose a known object that is from another one of my hobbies, Warhammer 40k. I have decided to make a <a href=\"http://oz.games-workshop.com/games/40k/tau/extras/wallpaper/images/WP_Hammerhead_1024x768.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Tau Hammerhead</a>.\n\nNote: The image to the right will always be the latest high resolution render.  Click to enlarge.\n\n\n\nMy goal is to make a realistic looking \"plastic model\". Meaning, I want to be able to make this model look very close to the plastic model I have on my desk. Not necessarily make it look \"real\" as in it can really fly and really exists, but rather make it look like its a real plastic model -- If that makes sense.\n\nTo that end I took some high quality photos of my hammerhead (sans gun) with an attempt to get orthographic references that I could use as backdrops.\n\nAnd I will be working in 4 hour blocks on this model, as I dont want my head to explode.\n\nHere is what I have after my first 4 hours - doesn't look like much but its actually extremely accurate and high poly.. heh\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" class=\"fancybox\" title=\"Tau Hammerhead WIP - Step 1\" href=\"/images/2006/12/hh_wip_s01.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"/images/2006/12/hh_wip_s01.thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Tau Hammerhead WIP - Step 1\" height=\"96\" /></a>\n\nAnother 4 Hours - looks nearly the same but I have more than doubled the poly count with details that are just not seen from this angle..\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" class=\"fancybox\" title=\"Tau Hammerhead WIP - Step 2\" href=\"/images/2006/12/hh_wip_s02.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"/images/2006/12/hh_wip_s02.thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Tau Hammerhead WIP - Step 2\" height=\"96\" /></a>\n\n+4 - I went ahead and mirrored the for the render just to give me a sense of what it will look like.. I'm very happy. I spent the majority of this 4 hour block cleaning up ugly non-planer polys. Thanks to some helpful advice over at the <a title=\"Non-planer poly discussion\" href=\"http://forums.luxology.com/discussion/topic.aspx?id=13987\" target=\"_blank\">Luxology Forums</a> regarding ways to deal with non-planer polygons.\n\nI think I have most of them under control, though I still would like a single tool that averages across multple vertices.. I'm tempted to post in the Luxology WIP forum, but some of those guys are REALLY good.. and I don't want to embarrass myself.. heh Maybe when I get a tad further along.\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" class=\"fancybox\" title=\"Tau Hammerhead WIP - Step 3\" href=\"/images/2006/12/steps1.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"/images/2006/12/steps1.thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Tau Hammerhead WIP - Step 3\" /></a>\n\n+4 - Okay I have been fighting with the nose curve for hours now.. It took me forever to get it \"right\" and I still think its a tad off.. But this is as close as I can get it.. The nose area needs a lot of work, but for a roughed out version this isn't terrible.\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" class=\"fancybox\" title=\"Tau Hammerhead WIP - Step 4\" href=\"/images/2006/12/step4.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"/images/2006/12/step4.thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Tau Hammerhead WIP - Step 4\" /></a>\n\n+4 - It actually took me every bit of this 4 hours to get the nose curves to work the way I wanted them to. At this point I call it \"better\", but not yet to the point I want it.. It just still looks off to me. Next I work on some of the lower body curve.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a rel=\"lightbox\" class=\"fancybox\" title=\"Tau Hammerhead WIP - Step 5\" href=\"/images/2006/12/hh_wip_s05.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"/images/2006/12/hh_wip_s05.thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Tau Hammerhead WIP - Step 5\" /></a></p>\n+4 - I took a break from working on the main body of the hammer head and invested some time into the main gun.. So far so good...\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a rel=\"lightbox\" class=\"fancybox\" title=\"Tau Hammerhead WIP - Main Gun\" href=\"/images/2007/01/hh_wip_gun01.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"/images/2007/01/hh_wip_gun01.thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Tau Hammerhead WIP - Main Gun\" /></a></p>\n+4 - I can honestly say that the turret sucked.. It was hard to get done because of its shape. A dome shape sprouting out of another dome, off center - fun fun.<a rel=\"lightbox\" title=\"Tau Hammerhead WIP - Step 7\" href=\"/images/2007/01/hh_wip_s07.jpg\"></a>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a rel=\"lightbox\" class=\"fancybox\" title=\"Tau Hammerhead WIP - Step 7\" href=\"http://rsow.com/files/2007/01/hh_wip_s07.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"/images/2007/01/hh_wip_s07.thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Tau Hammerhead WIP - Step 7\" height=\"96\" /></a></p>\nWell a bunch of time has passed.. My main render / model machine died the bad death a while back and it has taken me quite sometime to get back up and running..\n\nI'm still roughing out the model at this point, no serious details yet. In the shot below you can see I have loaded the turret, gun and main mesh all into one model and have begun working on the front drone mounts.\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" class=\"fancybox\" title=\"Hammerhead - Step 8\" href=\"/images/2007/05/hh_wip_s08.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"/images/2007/05/hh_wip_s08.thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Hammerhead - Step 8\" /></a>\n+4ish - I didn't time it but I figure its roughly 4 hours. This update brings with it a new render style.. I plan to render all future example shots like this using the Ambient Occlusion setting in Modo.\n\nI have added detail to the front of the tank and defined the burst cannon. Only one side though, as I haven't instanced it yet. A lot more detail to be done here, but a good start.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a rel=\"lightbox\" class=\"fancybox\" title=\"Hammerhead - Step 8\" href=\"/images/2007/05/hh_wip_s09.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"/images/2007/05/hh_wip_s09.thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Hammerhead - Step 9\" /></a></p>\n\n\n<hr />\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\"  class=\"fancybox\"href=\"/images/2009/05/turret-texture-test-01.jpg\"><img title=\"Turret Texture Test\" src=\"/images/2009/05/turret-texture-test-01-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Turret Texture Test\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Turret Texture Test</span></a>\n\nMay 2009; Reboot of this project\n\n+ 8 hours -- Okay so.. The latest version of this thing is to the point where I can start trying to texture it..   I have always Suuuucked at texturing so this is a dive off the deep end.. I really really want to get a graphical tablet as you can't take advantage of some of the power of Modo without one.   Here is where I am at right now..\n\n+ 8 hours -- <a  class=\"fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2009/05/engine-texture-test-03.jpg\">Click to see</a> I have continued to texture the model quite a bit and even went so far as to purchase a graphics tablet.. It's Soooooo much easier to texture the model when using a pen!!   Especially considering the modo folks designed the program to use one.  heh  I'm having a lot of fun with this..  The image is a double stack front/back render and is a tad tall to include in the post.. so click the link to see it open in a lightbox in the page.\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" class=\"fancybox\" href=\"/images/2009/05/turret-texture-test-01.jpg\"><img title=\"Turret Texture Test\" src=\"/images/2009/05/turret-texture-test-01-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Turret Texture Test\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Turret Texture Test</span></a>\n\n+ 8 hours -- Well I spent a good chunk of the day completely redoing the turret portion of the hammer head, adding a lot more detail as well as adding textures.  It's not done yet.. I'm slowly using my tablet to add detail to the textures as well as playing with various noise amounts..  Its interesting finding the right balance..\n\nI also spent quite a bit of time with the UV mapping tools to try to hone my UV skills.. One thing I used to be bad about (and still am in some cases) is just using an atlas explosion of the model into a UV.. Done.  I find that it's not a very good method for UV'ing because you get strange artifacts and defects when painting..   You're far better served actually correctly unwrapping the model and then positioning it on the map in order to maximize the available space..   I'm still learning this..\n\nFun stuff.. I'll be adding this part of the mesh to the main model later this week.\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" class=\"fancybox\" href=\"/images/2009/05/currenthighresrender1.jpg\"><img title=\"More Texturing\" src=\"/images/2009/05/currenthighresrender-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"More Texturing\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>More Texturing</span></a>\n\n+ 8 hours -- I have been working on the body of the hammerhead.  I have mostly fixed the nose area which I think was bulbous and ugly previously.  It doesn't perfectly match the actual physical model but at this point its probably as close as I can get it without completely starting over.\n\nI have divided up the various areas into their respective colors and will begin the texturing process once I get the cockpit bump in place on top of the model.\n\nSo yet again it's been a while since I worked on this.. I recently lost my harddrive and thought I lost this model entirely!!! Which lets be honest would have made me cry a little..  Lucky for me one of my coworkers managed to save the model off the drive for me and I have now backed it up to a raid 5 nas.. So shouldn't happen again..\n\nI am getting pretty close to being done with this model I think..  The back door, the landing gear and the chin turret still need to be completed but once that's done I think I'll count it done and stop working on it.\n\nOver all I'm fairly happy with it but you can really tell as you look at the mesh that I didn't know what I was doing in quite a few areas..\n","collection":"posts","url":"/tau-hammerhead-in-3d/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2007-01-04-frys-strikes-again.md","collection":"posts","url":"/frys-strikes-again/","path":"_posts/2007-01-04-frys-strikes-again.md","id":"/frys-strikes-again","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Fry's strikes again!","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2007-01-04 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"frys-strikes-again","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2006-12-26-tau-hammerhead-in-3d.md","excerpt":"I frequently troll various 3D forums and just about always come away with a feeling of inadequacy..

Every time I buy something there, it's defective and usually has been opened and returned before.  If someone returns a product for being broken, why do they insist on putting it back out on the floor?!    Does boxing it up some how make it magically work? -  It's over Fry's.  I officially will no longer shop at your stores.\n\nI'd rather have higher prices on products that actually work, rather than deal with your shit..\n\nWhy would you do this?   If customer A buys a $100  joystick, takes it home and tries to use it - only to find out that there is a short in the cord making the joystick unusable - a two part joystick that requires power to both devices is oddly not very useful if one of the devices doesn't get powered - it's perfectly reasonable for him to take it back and get another one.  Probably happens all the time.   When he returns it they always ask what the problem was - why do you ignore it?!\n\nNo no.. just box it back up, maybe some other sucker will buy it..\n\nIn steps me, customer B - as in Boob - who purchases the new joystick blissfully unaware that it had been previously purchased and stuffed back into the box god knows how many times..\n\nFry's USED to put stickers on the box saying that \"this product has been previously opened\".. yeah they don't do that any more..   Now they dress up the box as it was and stick it back on the floor, obviously with out doing ANY checks what so ever..  And not disclosing in any way what so ever that they item you're purchasing as NEW, isn't.\n\nSo when I got home - 55minute drive ONE WAY - and opened my new joystick, the bags and twisties and what not inside were all akimbo and clearly not how the factory would have packed it.    Not a good sign.    My first thought was;  Well shit - this has been previously opened.. even though they sold it to me as if it were new..   Bastards..\n\nAnd guess what.. its broken to boot - completely unusable.  The device had nicks and scratches on the outside of it and the cables had very clear shorts in it.  So now I'm forced to return it - JUST LIKE THE FIRST GUY!\n\nWhy do this Fry's?  All you're doing is pissing off customers..\n\nDo you just count sales?  I mean does this count as 2 sales for you .. whoo hoo... Never mind the fact that it was returned twice so the bottom line is still zero.. no no.. its two sales we can report!  Go us!    is that it?\n\nOr do you expect the customer to troll the rest of the store and buy other things while returning their defective product?  'cause here's a clue..  they don't.  They are pissed off that you have inconvenienced them and forced them to come when they didn't want to.. so the last  thing they want to do is buy something else from you that they probably will just have to return again..\n\nIT'S BAD BUSINESS!  And if it happened only once or twice.. I could forgive that..  Hey people are just human and make mistakes.. woops that one got put back on the shelf by mistake..  but no.. this happens CONSTANTLY at Fry's..  It's got to be part of your store policy or something; \"We only return stuff to the manufacturer if its been returned to the store 10 or more times.. \"\n\nWell guess what - you've lost a customer forever.  Others that I know have also sworn off your crappy store and if you keep this up no one will want to shop there.\n\nThere are quite a few other stores that do what you do - only better.   Your low prices aren't worth the bullshit of having to return everything, and I do mean everything.  With the exception of a pair of memory sticks that I got at Fry's (also had been pre-opened) I have had to return everything because it was defective..  Never again.  I'd rather pay the extra one or two percent and know that the product I got was worth a damn..\n\nToday I will return this joystick and demand a refund, at which point Fry's.. You're dead to me.\n","collection":"posts","url":"/frys-strikes-again/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2007-01-04-frys-strikes-again.md","collection":"posts","url":"/frys-strikes-again/","path":"_posts/2007-01-04-frys-strikes-again.md","id":"/frys-strikes-again","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Fry's strikes again!","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2007-01-04 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"frys-strikes-again","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2007-01-06-home-depot-kicks-ass.md","content":"For christmas I got some home depot gift cards..

I want a machine that I can hook up to my computer and have it \"output\" or \"print\" a 3d model.  The technology is here, and it's here now.. but it still costs around $20k!\n\nI mean it might as well be a million..  At this point, its not quite to the at home market.. its still something that only big companies can afford.. and that's a damn shame..  The market is SO there..

No more paying Forgeworld $70 for a model that costs them nothing to produce.. I can just kick it out of my handy dandy 3d printer..   Suddenly the market would shift from making real products to making 3d models that you print out yourself..

A long way from nothing, but an even longer way from something useful..  And considering its 2007 and we are supposed to have flying cars by now.. I don't think this is too tall of an order.\n\nThere must be a way to create some stereolithography or polyjet machine that could do the trick on a home scale.. If <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sears.com/carve\">Sears can come up with a at home CNC carving machine</a>, then surely someone can come up with an at home fabrication device...\n\nOH well.. for now a pipe dream... and most likely for the forseeable future..  Back to buying my models at over priced stores in the UK that take ages to ship..\n","collection":"posts","url":"/homebrew-rapid-prototyping/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2007-01-13-homebrew-rapid-prototyping.md","collection":"posts","url":"/homebrew-rapid-prototyping/","path":"_posts/2007-01-13-homebrew-rapid-prototyping.md","id":"/homebrew-rapid-prototyping","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Homebrew Rapid Prototyping","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2007-01-13 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"homebrew-rapid-prototyping","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2007-01-18-goddamn-i-hate-people.md","content":"I'm driving down a road near my house doing about 62/63 in a 65.  It's wet. It's cold out (35ish) and there is visible ice on the sides of the road from the previous nights freeze.  The main part of the road was clearish, but I was still going too fast for conditions.\n\nSome redneck jackass gets in behind me and is flashing his lights while tailgating..  Clearly I'm not going fast enough for him.\n\nNow, I'm eventually turning left on this road so I don't want to change lanes, and we are coming up on a car in the right lane that is driving pretty slowly..  I just didn't feel it was safe to change lanes.  Not the case with this guy behind me.. He whips around me on the icy road, flipping me off and honking all the while, and when he gets in front of me he jams on his brakes..\n\nAt this point, It should be legal for me to open fire.   This guy is driving recklessly and trying to cause a wreck with me - there is a very clear case for road rage in that instance, but I have only my word against his.  Though I may be in luck there, a person of this nature probably hasn't yet mastered the power of speech..\n\nMy question is; Why do people insist on driving like jerks?!\n\nI wasn't doing anything wrong.  I was doing the speedlimit in the left lane, on icy/wet roads at night.    Even if it was perfectly dry roads, in the middle of the afternoon.  If I'm doing the speedlimit, I'm golden. There aint shit you can say.\n\nThis is the point that everyone chimes in and says, \"Slow traffic is supposed to keep right.\"  No.  Wrong.  Define for me \"slow traffic.\"   If I'm doing the speed limit, it aint me. More over, tell me when you're allowed legally to exceed the speedlimit.  Hint: Never. Not even passing.\n\nYet some how I'm the asshole for following the law. The sad thing is, even though there is a major car accident something like every 8 seconds in America alone, it will take a person living through one before they learn anything.\n\nI don't plan to be in one -- You wanna go faster than me, faster than the speed limit?  Go the fuck around.\n","collection":"posts","url":"/goddamn-i-hate-people/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2007-01-19-ie7s-jsfoo-sucks-so-badly-its-painful.md","collection":"posts","url":"/ie7s-jsfoo-sucks-so-badly-its-painful/","path":"_posts/2007-01-19-ie7s-jsfoo-sucks-so-badly-its-painful.md","id":"/ie7s-jsfoo-sucks-so-badly-its-painful","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"IE7's JSFoo sucks so badly it's painful!","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2007-01-19 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"ie7s-jsfoo-sucks-so-badly-its-painful","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2007-01-18-goddamn-i-hate-people.md","excerpt":"Some redneck jackass gets in behind me and is flashing his lights while tailgating..
