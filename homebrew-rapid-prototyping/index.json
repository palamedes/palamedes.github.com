IE7's javascript engine is complete shit.  They need to scrap it completely and start over.  Firstly, It's sloooowww..  IE7's JS is slower than IE6.. which I find to be impressive as IE6 was slow as hell..\n\nIn one of my current projects we have a bunch of objects being cloned in real time to make a popup menu.  It pops up over all other divs and what not from a nested element to a child element of the body.  It's a very simple procedure;\n\nMouse over the icon - pop goes the menu.\n\nWe are attaching the event to fire the pop dynamically.. (Don't even get me started on the \"attachEvent\" command.. Can we please use addEventListener like everyone else.. )  When the even fires it is sent to a function which does the work.\n\nAll other browsers know that \"this\" in that function is the sender.. Not IE.  IE expressly requires you to define the sender through the function handle and then call \"sender.fromElement\" to get the sender.  That's retarded.  Oh but the good times don't stop there.. No no..\n\nSee it takes time to figure out who the sender is, and it will report the sender as whatever is below the mouse when it finally gets around to it.    So the fromElement could be fricken anything! Its the most unreliable crap on the planet.\n\nThank you very much Microsoft for this wonderful piece of crap browser.  You're an inspiration to us all.\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2007-01-18-goddamn-i-hate-people.md","url":"/goddamn-i-hate-people/","relative_path":"_posts/2007-01-18-goddamn-i-hate-people.md","id":"/goddamn-i-hate-people","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Goddamn I hate people..","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2007-01-18 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"goddamn-i-hate-people","ext":".md"},"url":"/ie7s-jsfoo-sucks-so-badly-its-painful/","relative_path":"_posts/2007-01-19-ie7s-jsfoo-sucks-so-badly-its-painful.md","id":"/ie7s-jsfoo-sucks-so-badly-its-painful","collection":"posts","excerpt":"Since I work for IBM, I can't officially say that IE sucks in my code comments -- someone complained..","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"IE7's JSFoo sucks so badly it's painful!","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2007-01-19 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"ie7s-jsfoo-sucks-so-badly-its-painful","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2007-01-18-goddamn-i-hate-people.md","output":null,"content":"I'm driving down a road near my house doing about 62/63 in a 65.

The main part of the road was clearish, but I was still going too fast for conditions.\n\nSome redneck jackass gets in behind me and is flashing his lights while tailgating..  Clearly I'm not going fast enough for him.\n\nNow, I'm eventually turning left on this road so I don't want to change lanes, and we are coming up on a car in the right lane that is driving pretty slowly..  I just didn't feel it was safe to change lanes.  Not the case with this guy behind me.. He whips around me on the icy road, flipping me off and honking all the while, and when he gets in front of me he jams on his brakes..\n\nAt this point, It should be legal for me to open fire.   This guy is driving recklessly and trying to cause a wreck with me - there is a very clear case for road rage in that instance, but I have only my word against his.  Though I may be in luck there, a person of this nature probably hasn't yet mastered the power of speech..\n\nMy question is; Why do people insist on driving like jerks?!\n\nI wasn't doing anything wrong.  I was doing the speedlimit in the left lane, on icy/wet roads at night.    Even if it was perfectly dry roads, in the middle of the afternoon.  If I'm doing the speedlimit, I'm golden. There aint shit you can say.\n\nThis is the point that everyone chimes in and says, \"Slow traffic is supposed to keep right.\"  No.  Wrong.  Define for me \"slow traffic.\"   If I'm doing the speed limit, it aint me. More over, tell me when you're allowed legally to exceed the speedlimit.  Hint: Never. Not even passing.\n\nYet some how I'm the asshole for following the law. The sad thing is, even though there is a major car accident something like every 8 seconds in America alone, it will take a person living through one before they learn anything.\n\nI don't plan to be in one -- You wanna go faster than me, faster than the speed limit?

Every time I buy something there, it's defective and usually has been opened and returned before.  If someone returns a product for being broken, why do they insist on putting it back out on the floor?!    Does boxing it up some how make it magically work? -  It's over Fry's.  I officially will no longer shop at your stores.\n\nI'd rather have higher prices on products that actually work, rather than deal with your shit..\n\nWhy would you do this?   If customer A buys a $100  joystick, takes it home and tries to use it - only to find out that there is a short in the cord making the joystick unusable - a two part joystick that requires power to both devices is oddly not very useful if one of the devices doesn't get powered - it's perfectly reasonable for him to take it back and get another one.  Probably happens all the time.   When he returns it they always ask what the problem was - why do you ignore it?!\n\nNo no.. just box it back up, maybe some other sucker will buy it..\n\nIn steps me, customer B - as in Boob - who purchases the new joystick blissfully unaware that it had been previously purchased and stuffed back into the box god knows how many times..\n\nFry's USED to put stickers on the box saying that \"this product has been previously opened\".. yeah they don't do that any more..   Now they dress up the box as it was and stick it back on the floor, obviously with out doing ANY checks what so ever..  And not disclosing in any way what so ever that they item you're purchasing as NEW, isn't.\n\nSo when I got home - 55minute drive ONE WAY - and opened my new joystick, the bags and twisties and what not inside were all akimbo and clearly not how the factory would have packed it.    Not a good sign.    My first thought was;  Well shit - this has been previously opened.. even though they sold it to me as if it were new..   Bastards..\n\nAnd guess what.. its broken to boot - completely unusable.  The device had nicks and scratches on the outside of it and the cables had very clear shorts in it.  So now I'm forced to return it - JUST LIKE THE FIRST GUY!\n\nWhy do this Fry's?  All you're doing is pissing off customers..\n\nDo you just count sales?  I mean does this count as 2 sales for you .. whoo hoo... Never mind the fact that it was returned twice so the bottom line is still zero.. no no.. its two sales we can report!  Go us!    is that it?\n\nOr do you expect the customer to troll the rest of the store and buy other things while returning their defective product?  'cause here's a clue..  they don't.  They are pissed off that you have inconvenienced them and forced them to come when they didn't want to.. so the last  thing they want to do is buy something else from you that they probably will just have to return again..\n\nIT'S BAD BUSINESS!  And if it happened only once or twice.. I could forgive that..  Hey people are just human and make mistakes.. woops that one got put back on the shelf by mistake..  but no.. this happens CONSTANTLY at Fry's..  It's got to be part of your store policy or something; \"We only return stuff to the manufacturer if its been returned to the store 10 or more times.. \"\n\nWell guess what - you've lost a customer forever.  Others that I know have also sworn off your crappy store and if you keep this up no one will want to shop there.\n\nThere are quite a few other stores that do what you do - only better.   Your low prices aren't worth the bullshit of having to return everything, and I do mean everything.  With the exception of a pair of memory sticks that I got at Fry's (also had been pre-opened) I have had to return everything because it was defective..  Never again.  I'd rather pay the extra one or two percent and know that the product I got was worth a damn..\n\nToday I will return this joystick and demand a refund, at which point Fry's.. You're dead to me.\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2006-12-26-tau-hammerhead-in-3d.md","url":"/tau-hammerhead-in-3d/","relative_path":"_posts/2006-12-26-tau-hammerhead-in-3d.md","id":"/tau-hammerhead-in-3d","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Hobbies"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Tau Hammerhead in 3D","layout":"post","tags":["3D Graphics","Tank"],"image":"/images/2009/05/currenthighresrender1.jpg","ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2006-12-26 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"tau-hammerhead-in-3d","ext":".md"},"url":"/frys-strikes-again/","relative_path":"_posts/2007-01-04-frys-strikes-again.md","id":"/frys-strikes-again","collection":"posts","excerpt":"I'd rather have higher prices on products that actually work, rather than deal with your shit Fry's..","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Fry's strikes again!","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2007-01-04 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"frys-strikes-again","ext":".md"},"url":"/home-depot-kicks-ass/","relative_path":"_posts/2007-01-06-home-depot-kicks-ass.md","id":"/home-depot-kicks-ass","collection":"posts","excerpt":"Home Depot kicks ass - they make things simple and good, even when they could have easily turned me away.","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings","Hobbies"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Home Depot kicks ass!","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2007-01-06 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"home-depot-kicks-ass","ext":".md"},"url":"/homebrew-rapid-prototyping/","relative_path":"_posts/2007-01-13-homebrew-rapid-prototyping.md","id":"/homebrew-rapid-prototyping","collection":"posts","excerpt":"In the words of a friend.. \"Santa clause machines are cool..\"  and I can't agree more.","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Homebrew Rapid Prototyping","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2007-01-13 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"homebrew-rapid-prototyping","ext":".md"}
