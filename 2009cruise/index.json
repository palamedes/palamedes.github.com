Why the hell not?!  At this point I think it would be just as easy/difficult to create a game via a webbrowser as it would via any other medium..\n\nMore over you wouldn't have to sell any kind of client.. everyone with a modern computer has a web browser..  You trade having to create a game that works with hundreds of different graphics drivers and computer configurations for having to deal with 5 major browsers that all do things slightly differently, but big deal..  jQuery does most of that nicely, so really you're only stuck fixing CSS issues..\n\nAs always the trick is in coming up with a game that is compelling enough that others want to play it.  I mentioned Masters of Orion above because I think that's likely one of the best games of all time and as such a perfect candidate for remake in this format.\n\nGranted you're not going to make the next 3D masterpiece as a browser based game.. but I say good..  Games these days are moving towards looking good with zero game play..  Give me a game that is fun to play any day over the latest wiz-bang graphics.. I think the browser game market is a good place to try this..\n","collection":"posts","url":"/jquery-and-browser-based-games/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2009-03-22-mercedes-benz-clk350.md","collection":"posts","url":"/mercedes-benz-clk350/","path":"_posts/2009-03-22-mercedes-benz-clk350.md","id":"/mercedes-benz-clk350","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Mercedes-Benz CLK350","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2009/03/mb1-150x150.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-03-22 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"mercedes-benz-clk350","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2009-03-20-jquery-and-browser-based-games.md","excerpt":"I have been playing with the jQuery animate functionality a bit today and it occurred to me that jQuery would likely be the perfect library to build a browser based game on top of..","id":"/jquery-and-browser-based-games","draft":false,"categories":["Software Development"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"jQuery and Browser based games","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2009/03/t-and-c-surf-designs.png","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-03-20 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"jquery-and-browser-based-games","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2009-03-22-mercedes-benz-clk350.md","content":"<img title=\"CLK350\" src=\"/images/2009/03/mb1-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Mercedes-Benz CLK350\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" class='pull-right' />\n\nSo I have been in a the market for a new car for a while now.  I haven't really pushed for it with my wife because neither one of us really wanted a car payment and my truck, while almost 10 years old, worked just fine.\n\nBut I was sort of looking.   My wife owns a Mercedes-Benz SLK230 hard top convertible and I really do enjoy driving it.  Not so much the Mercedes-Benz part, but the convertible part.  So I was in the market for a new convertible and was sort of browsing around with no plans to buy.\n\nI wanted to keep the price of the car around thirty thousand dollars give or take. That was the soft limit I had applied to myself  --  Any more than that and I was spending too much.\n\nPlus I had a pretty specific style of car I wanted.. The ones that were in the running where the Mitsubishi Eclipse, the Pontiac Solstice, the Saturn Sky, the Nissan 350z or anything else comparable..\n\nI had decided I didn't want the Nissan because I didn't like the 350's interior.. it just seemed cheap to me, the dash just sucked.   The body was good but if I don't like the interior (the part I would be looking at) I know I wouldn't be happy. (Addendum, the 370's look much much nicer..)\n\nI didn't like the Solstice or the Sky for two different reasons, even though it's essentially the same car.  Again the body looked great!  But the interior of the Solstice looked kinda cheap again, and the Sky is a Saturn and everyone I know that has ever owned a Saturn said they weren't very good cars.  Fair enough, other buyers reviews go a long way for me.  The Sky was out by popular demand  and the Solstice with it's cheap interior was a Pontiac which I'm kinda \"Feh\" about anyway.  Scratch those two.\n\nThat left the Eclipse.  I sorta liked the old Eclipse, but when they introduced the new body style I thought it looked great!  I wanted to check it out more thoroughly..  I had done some pricing, read some reviews, built the car I wanted online and it really did fit the bill.. It was time to check one out in person..\n\nSo today we decided on a whim to go to the local Mitsubishi dealership and scope one of those out..  Just a fun way to spend a lazy Saturday, with no intention of buying anything.. Just window shopping..\n\nFirstly it took us hours to find a Mitsubishi dealership.. There are quite a few of them listed as being in Austin, but we could only find one.   Apparently they had a massive restructuring or something and are hurting..  That didn't bode well..   But we did find one and took a test drive..  Not a bad car but I wasn't super impressed..\n\nI did like it, but it wasn't anything that I felt I needed, and it really didn't feel like a huge upgrade from my Toyota Tundra..  Not a bad car and while yes it fit the bill being as I wanted to go from a truck to a sports car, it sort of felt more like a lateral move.. I wasn't sure I wanted to spend that kind of money on a car I was kind of \"eh\" about, especially since it would have been for 10 years.  (I assume all vehicle purchases are for 10 years.. )\n\nMelissa suggested we check out some of the other dealerships in the area to see what they had on their used lot..  Just to sort of round out the day..    Plus one of her coworkers said she had seen some really good deals on the Mercedes lot.  (I thought this was a clever plan by Melissa to go look at the cars she likes and wants..heh.. Turns out I was sort of right.. she was browsing I noted.. Pretty sure she's gonna demand a new car soon.. But that's another story.. )\n\nI was okay with that notion, but I'm not a huge fan of used cars.. I always feel like you're buying someone elses problem.. But Melissa's SLK was used when we got it and it's a great car with no problems..   I guess I'm used to thinking of people buying the cheap 15K car and then selling it used completely trashed..  So her experience with the SLK really kind of opened my eyes to the fact that people with nicer cars, most likely have taken care of them..\n\nSo with that in mind, we hit up an Infiniti dealer, a Lexus dealership and finally a Mercedes-Benz dealership all just browsing around.. No intention to buy.   Most of them had nothing in the used car areas that was remotely interesting to me or completely outside the realm of affordable ( which was what I expected to begin with. )\n\nWhile looking around at the Mercedes-Benz dealership though, we sat in a bunch of the cars which brought a sales man over..  Nice guy who was willing to just shoot the breeze with us while we tooled around pretending to be able to afford sixty and seventy thousand dollar cars..\n\nThen we started looking at the thirty and forty thousand dollar cars and I realized that this used thirty thousand dollar car is FAR nicer than the brand new Eclipse could EVER be..  I told the guy what I really wanted and he said something to the effect of \"Oh yeah I have a car just like that over here.. \"..  No wait.. Really?   A nice fully featured convertible v6 at around thirty thousand?\n\n<img class=\"pull-right\" title=\"mb2\" src=\"/images/2009/03/mb2.jpg\" alt=\"mb2\" width=\"350\" height=\"235\" />And sure as hell..  He put me in a used 2007 Mercedes-Benz CLK350 with only 14k miles on it, that had me at hello.  It was inside their show room right next to a brand new CLK350 and you couldn't tell which one was used.\n\nThis car had previously been driven by a Mercedes-Benz executive up in New York and as such it had every possible option.  Normally selling new for $63k, it had been incorrectly priced at $36k.   I say incorrectly because the manager rushed out wanting to know if we were taking the car home because it was supposed to be priced at $40k like the other used ones on the lot.  (Apparently this one was one of 3 similar cars they had)\n\nI know you're thinking this was a dog &amp; pony show by the dealer, but I didn't get that impression.  The manager did it out of earshot of us taking the salesman aside to pass this information on.. heh.. Apparently the car was flagged in their system as being incorrectly priced and to revisit it the next business day.. (He told us this once it was all too late for them to up the price.)\n\nAnd so, with no intention to buy anything.. I drove it home.\n\nMelissa was as excited as I was.. I mean she loves Mercedes-Benz anyway, but this is an awesome vehicle for the price..  I really feel we got a steal..  We ran it through Kelly Blue Book and it says it's worth over $37k..  Most dealerships always ask more than what KBB.com says, so the fact that it was even less than that lends credit to the price mistake..\n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.carfax.com/VehicleHistory/p/Report.cfx?partner=EBZ_0&amp;vin=WDBTK56F17F209480\">Carfax report</a> for the car confirms everything that they salesman was telling us and shows that it's never been wrecked or anything..\n\nIt's so nice.. I mean this is a class of car I have never owned.. it's so far beyond what the Eclipse is, it's not a fair comparison..   I never looked at any of the Mercedes as an option because they were all so expensive.. I had my mind set on a new car not a used one.. it really didn't occur to me to think of a used Mercedes. Plus with it's 4 year bumper to bumper warranty what the hell!\n\nIt really is an awesome car.. it drives so nicely I can't even describe it.. Plus sitting inside you'd never know it was a convertible.. It's so quiet!!  You actually hear less road noise in this convertible than you did in my truck!\n\n<img class=\"pull-right\" title=\"mb3\" src=\"/images/2009/03/mb3.jpg\" alt=\"mb3\" width=\"350\" height=\"235\" />The interior is incredible..  It's got an in-dash DVD navigation system, 6 disc CD changer in the glove box that does normal and MP3 cd's, a harman/kardon logic7 sound system, has Sirius satellite radio installed, heated seats, premium leather upholstery every where, automatic adjusting everything... etc.. I mean it's nutz..\n\nGo to their website and check all the options.. that's this car.  The only thing it doesn't have is the phone.  It has all the hookups for it, but no phone installed.  The salesman told me for $400 I could get a bluetooth dongle that would hook into the car making it work with my iPhone.. FUN!\n\nThey took my truck as a trade in on the spot for more than KBB.com valued it at, which I have to admit was a bit of a shock!  And started the paperwork in a flash..  I had to move a lot of junk from my truck to the trunk of the car because I really wasn't expecting to do this today..  I didn't even have time to say good bye to the chariot that had bore me for so long.. (It really was a good truck.. I would recommend the Tundra to anyone..)\n\nBut seriously this car is awesome.. It's hard for me to describe how nice it is..  I'm supremely happy with this purchase and I can easily see this being yet another car I have for 10 years..  With the Eclipse I walked a way feeling a tad underwhelmed by the experience.. here, I'm completely blown away..  This car is so much finer than anything else I have ever driven and I can tell it's going to be a joy to drive for a long while yet..\n\nFunny how these things work out.. I really did have no plans to purchase today..\n","collection":"posts","url":"/mercedes-benz-clk350/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2009-03-22-mercedes-benz-clk350.md","collection":"posts","url":"/mercedes-benz-clk350/","path":"_posts/2009-03-22-mercedes-benz-clk350.md","id":"/mercedes-benz-clk350","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Mercedes-Benz CLK350","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2009/03/mb1-150x150.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-03-22 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"mercedes-benz-clk350","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2009-04-03-2009cruise.md","content":"<a class='pull-right fancybox' rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise%20046.jpg\"><img title=\"cruise-046\" src=\"/images/2009/04/cruise-046-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Voyager of the Seas\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>\n\nSo I have been asked repeatedly when am I going to get these photos posted.. I have to apologize that its taken this long..  My only real excuse is that I'm lazy..  I could lie and say it took a while to get them developed, but it's a digital camera.. In reality the thing that took the longest was having a clear way to display them.  The lightbox made that happen, then it was just a matter of typing this stuff out. It's a long post.. but then it was 7 days of fun so.. lots to talk about..\n\nBelow I give a day by day break down of what the photos are as well as where / what we were doing at the time of the photo.  Each heading will have all the photos for that section and some of them will be explained further within the body of the text giving the same link again.\n\n**Note: Clicking the photo link will open the photo in a lightbox internal to this page.

There were a lot of folks crammed into a fairly large building all trying to get on the ship.  What I didn't realize until we came back was that on the opposite side of the building there were a lot of people trying to get off the ship.  This is a 24 hour, 7 day a week operation that goes non-stop.   The ship is never empty.  I guess in order to turn a profit it has to go go go!  Looking back I kinda felt it could do with some streamlining.. Now I think they did an amazing job all things considered.\n\nWe drove to the dock, turned over our luggage, went and parked the car, rode the bus to the ship, entered the terminal, passed customs (or whatever it is) and boarded the ship.  It all took probably 2 hours, but it went fairly quickly.\n\n__In port -- Houston Ship Channel__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 001.jpg\">001</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 002.jpg\">002</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 003.jpg\">003</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 004.jpg\">004</a>\nUpon getting in the cabin, I walked out on our balcony and started snapping off a couple pics of the scenery around us.. Not so pretty..\n\n__In port -- The Cabin__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 005.jpg\">005</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 006.jpg\">006</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 007.jpg\">007</a>\nThe cabin itself upon entering seemed incredibly small -- and in fact was extremely tiny.. But to be honest, there was actually plenty of room considering we only slept there..  The bathroom (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 007.jpg\">007</a>) was not a lot bigger than an airplane lavatory, but served its purposes nicely.. Though you pretty much had to go out side to change your mind.\n\n__<a class='pull-right fancybox' rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise%20009.jpg\"><img title=\"cruise-009\" src=\"/images/2009/04/cruise-009-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"I feel safer already...\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>__\n\n__In port -- The illusion of safety__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 008.jpg\">008</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 009.jpg\">009</a>\nBefore we leave port they have all five thousand people (or however many there are.. it's near 5k) don life jackets and go to their assigned safety area in order to evacuate the ship in case of an emergency..  It was just a drill, and a complete sham.. Everyone was moving in this calm cool demeanor like nothing was going on -- this is just another fun excursion..  All of us lined up in our assigned area behind our given life boat.. Each boat was expected to hold about 100 people.. It was about then I realize that there was NO WAY IN HELL those boats would hold as many people as were standing next to them..  That's when I considered that in real life there would be mass panic and half those folks wouldn't get to the boat due to trample damage.. thus making room in the life boat..\n\n__Under way -- Houston Ship Channel__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 010.jpg\">010</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 011.jpg\">011</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 012.jpg\">012</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 013.jpg\">013</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 016.jpg\">016</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 018.jpg\">018</a>\nIt didn't get much prettier as we got under way but atleast the sky was starting to clear up.  As the ship started it's azipod impellers it churned up a lot of the muck and crap in the water (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 012.jpg\">012</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 016.jpg\">016</a>).. anyone up for a swim? (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 013.jpg\">013</a>)  I'm sure the birds wouldn't mind. Or the sharks!! (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 017.jpg\">017</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 018.jpg\">018</a>) (Okay those are actually dolphin or porpoise..)\n\n__Under way -- Ships in the Channel__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 020.jpg\">020</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 021.jpg\">021</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 022.jpg\">022</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 023.jpg\">023</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 024.jpg\">024</a>\nAs we headed out of the shipping channel heading into the gulf, we got to see a LOT of ships.. The funny thing is, my days playing submarine games made me think of how I would go about sinking these ships.. heh  Still it was neat to see these massive ships go about their business..\n\n__Under way -- Leaving the Channel__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 025.jpg\">025</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 026.jpg\">026</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 027.jpg\">027</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 028.jpg\">028</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 029.jpg\">029</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 030.jpg\">030</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 031.jpg\">031</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 032.jpg\">032</a>\nLooking back at Houston the shoreline actually looks kind of pretty.. It's nasty as ever but looks nice from this distance.. Nothing to do at this point but enjoy the cruise and look to the open ocean (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 032.jpg\">032</a>).\n\n__Under way -- Harbor master departs__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 033.jpg\">033</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 034.jpg\">034</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 035.jpg\">035</a>\nSo there was a little ship following us the whole way out of port which I assumed was the harbor guide.. What I didn't know was that we actually had a person on board that would have to get off and go back to Houston.  Once we got into the gulf, and I mean a good way out, the little ship ran itself right up against our hull and the guy got off..  it was interesting to watch but I wasn't able to get any good shots of it.. It was dark so I had to fiddle with the camera settings to get what I got.. Sorry for the poor quality of these.\n\n###Day Two -- On the way to Cozumel, Mexico\nWe didn't do a lot on day one but wander around the ship getting to know our surroundings.  We met our dinner companions and generally had a fun time.  It was a quiet and relaxing day.\n\n__Under way -- Holy crap the water is blue?!__ ::  <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 036.jpg\">036</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 037.jpg\">037</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 038.jpg\">038</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 039.jpg\">039</a>\nSo.. you wouldn't know it to stare at the water in Houston, but the water out in the ocean is actually blue!! (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 037.jpg\">037</a>)  I mean blue like they poured food coloring in it.. heh  I woke up to a very blue ocean outside (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 038.jpg\">038</a>) and an absolutely beautiful day (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 039.jpg\">039</a>).  We were very lucky in that our entire trip consisted of days like this. It didn't get overcast until the very last day back.\n\n__Under way -- Wandering around the ship__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 040.jpg\">040</a>\nHoly crap this boat was huge..  To give you some idea, it's a 15 story building at sea.  It had 15 stories ABOVE the water line, and 3 or 4 below.  It had a HUGE theatre in the center, an ice rink, and most importantly a strip mall (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 040.jpg\">040</a>) that runs down the center of the boat..\n\n__Under way -- The occasional passer-by__ ::  <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 043.jpg\">043</a>\nI thought it was interesting that as vast as the ocean and the gulf is, we still occasionally saw other ships.. That tells me that either everyone travels along the same routes, or the ocean is full!\n\n<a class='pull-right fancybox' rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise%20041.jpg\"><img title=\"cruise-041\" src=\"/images/2009/04/cruise-041-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Magestic Sunsets\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>\n\n__Under way -- Sunsets__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 041.jpg\">041</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 042.jpg\">042</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 044.jpg\">044</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 045.jpg\">045</a>\nSomething I had looked forward to was being able to stand on the top of the ship and look around and see no land.  I wanted to see the ocean in all it's glory.. Holy crap.. It was absolutely beautiful out there..  The sunsets were amazing..\n\nI don't think I'm good enough of a photographer to truly bring the beauty of these sunsets to film.. I also didn't really have the camera to pull it off.. but it was nice let me tell ya..\n\nOver all this was a very good day.  Melissa and I got to enjoy one another's company on a ship that while full, didn't seem overly crowded.  When we wanted to be alone we would retire to the cabin.. other wise we were just wandering around.\n\nThere was ample to do in that each day they booked all manner of on board activities.. We didn't do too many of those mostly because we wanted to do our own thing..\n\n<a class='pull-right fancybox' rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise%20052.jpg\"><img title=\"cruise-052\" src=\"/images/2009/04/cruise-052-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Mexico!\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>\n\n###Day Three -- Cozumel, Mexico\nSo on day three, we pulled into Cozumel.\n\n__In port -- These ships are massive__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 040.jpg\">040</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 046.jpg\">046</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 047.jpg\">047</a>\nIt's hard to describe how large these ships are.. And in fact when you're on them you tend to compare them to the vastness of the ocean which makes them seem some what smallish.. but let me tell ya, they are anything but small.. As I pointed out above while wandering around, this ship is so big it has a street running down the center of it (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 040.jpg\">040</a>).. but what I think really shows it's size is when you see people standing next to it (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 046.jpg\">046</a>)..  There was a Carnival Cruise ship docked near by and its not anywhere near as big (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 047.jpg\">047</a>).  You can't tell really by the photo but it's smaller in every way.\n\n<a class='pull-right fancybox' rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Excursion%20018.jpg\"><img title=\"excursion-018\" src=\"/images/2009/04/excursion-018-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"She's so cute.. \" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>\n\n__Excursion -- <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Why_of_Fry\" target=\"_blank\">\"Scooty puff jr. sucks!!\"</a>__ ::\n* Most of these photos are poor quality due to the crappy underwater camera I got.

The crew of the excursion would scuba up and lead us around a small unimpressive reef while giving us critters to hold and taking our pictures..  It was pretty cool to be honest..  Not to mention down right cold..  The water was probably 68°F at best..  Which for me isn't too bad, but poor Melissa was shivering like a chihuahua.. She was basically one big goose bump..  The scooters were painfully slow.. They had ZERO power, and at one point we had divers behind us pushing hehe.. Thus, the reference to Futurama.. We called those things \"Scooty Puff Juniors\" for the rest of the trip..  The crew (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Excursion 027.jpg\">E27</a>) were really very nice and we didn't get very far from the ships (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Excursion 026.jpg\">E26</a>).. All in all it was a lot of fun, I very much enjoyed it even though the photos don't really tell much of a story.\n\n__In port -- Wandering around Cozumel__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 048.jpg\">048</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 049.jpg\">049</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 050.jpg\">050</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 051.jpg\">051</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 052.jpg\">052</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 053.jpg\">053</a>\nSo after our underwater fun, Melissa and I with my friends Calvin and Karen ended up wandering around Cozumel for the rest of the day.  We had a pretty good time, I mean we weren't mugged or anything.. but all in all I was fairly underwhelmed by Cozumel.  We ended up doing a LOT of walking and were quite tired by the end of it all (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 053.jpg\">053</a>)..  It was a long day..\n\n__In port -- Pictures of the coast__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 054.jpg\">054</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 055.jpg\">055</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 056.jpg\">056</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 057.jpg\">057</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 058.jpg\">058</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 063.jpg\">063</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 064.jpg\">064</a>\nAfter our day of swimming, and walking we were pretty tired.. Melissa took a nap and I wandered around the top of the ship taking pictures as the ship pushed off from the pier.  This picture better shows how much smaller the Carnival ships are compared to the Royal Carribbean ships. (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 058.jpg\">058</a>) I'm not even at the highest point on the ship and you can see I'm above the top of the other ship.\n\n__Under way -- Please don't feed the humans__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 059.jpg\">059</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 060.jpg\">060</a>\nOne thing the I thought was very neat was that you could go and watch the captain and crew pilot the ship.  There was a viewing area above and behind them where you could watch.. and that was awesome.. I took a picture of it and was shocked that it sorta came out. (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 059.jpg\">059</a>) You can't see all the cool stuff on the screens but.. so be it..  Oh and I found it funny as hell that they had signs posted all over to \"Please do not knock on glass.\" (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 060.jpg\">060</a>)\n\n<a class='pull-right fancybox' rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise%20062.jpg\"><img title=\"cruise-062\" src=\"/images/2009/04/cruise-062-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Some God Rays\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>\n\n__Under way -- Everyone!! Off the island!__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 061.jpg\">061</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 062.jpg\">062</a>\nI found it interesting that each port we visited had all the ships coming and going at the same time..  This seemed odd to me as one would think it would put a strain on everyone involved.. but.. *shrug* that's how they did it..\n\n__Under way -- A dog in our room?!__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 065.jpg\">065</a>\nAfter dinner on the third day we arrived back in our cabin (they called it a suite!) to find a dog on the bed!!!  This is one of those cute things they do for everyone each night.  I'm pretty sure they would have done it on the previous nights but we had the \"do not disturb\" sign on the door.\n\n###Day Four -- Grand Cayman\nSo I'm going to be a bit biased here.. Grand Cayman was by far my favorite stop..  But it's TINY!  Grand Cayman was basically a dot on the map.. The whole of Grand Cayman is an island that spans a colossal 76 square miles (Austin, Texas occupies 272 square miles) and it had more to do and more things to see than any of the other stops.   There were so many excursions it was hard to choose just one.  And it was such a beautiful place I could see myself living there.. (That's saying something for me.. )\n\n__Under way -- On our way to tender__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 066.jpg\">066</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 067.jpg\">067</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 068.jpg\">068</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 069.jpg\">069</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 070.jpg\">070</a>\nGrand Cayman is so small they don't have piers or docks for ships as large as the one we were on.  (or smaller ones)  Instead you have to get on board a smaller boat called a tender (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 068.jpg\">068</a>) that brings you into shore. (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 069.jpg\">069</a>)  And man do they ever crowd folks on these boats.. (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 070.jpg\">070</a>)   This aint the US where those pesky safety regulations get in the way. hehe  I didn't feel unsafe though.\n\n__Tendered -- Shopping! .. er.. okay maybe not__ :: *[No pictures of my shame]*\nInstead, what I felt like was a complete ass..  When you get on board the ship they issue everyone a card they call the \"Sea Pass\" with which you do everything.   It becomes your passport proxy as well as your credit card.  This one card allows you to do everything..  But of course it only works aboard ship.   I had gotten so used to just whipping out my sea pass that I completely forgot to bring my wallet to shore..   This meant we couldn't purchase anything while in Grand Cayman..\n\nI felt very very bad.  I was generally pissy for a couple hours because I know there were things Melissa wanted and that I couldn't provide for her because my dumb ass had forgotten the money..  I'm not sure how to convey to you the frustration I felt at myself over this..  I was very apologetic to Melissa and she said she understood, but I could tell she was disappointed.\n\nI promised to bring her back to Grand Cayman one day so she could do the shopping she wanted to do =)   Hell there was things I wanted too!\n\n__Excursion -- Dolphins ... and Birds?!__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 071.jpg\">071</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 072.jpg\">072</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 073.jpg\">073</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 084.jpg\">084</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 085.jpg\">085</a>\nAs I had stated above, there were a lot of excursions to choose from and due to time and the nature of these cruises we really could only do one per stop.  Melissa and I decided to do a \"Swim with the dolphins\" adventure type thing without Calvin and Karen.  They went on their own fun (and proceeded to get horribly sunburned..)  We got on a bus and were taken across the island to the dolphin facility.  The parking area was on the opposite side of a foresty area that we had to walk through and it was chalk full of exotic birds..  They were very friendly birds and would happily let us take pictures..\n\n<a class='pull-right fancybox' rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise%20077.jpg\"><img title=\"cruise-077\" src=\"/images/2009/04/cruise-077-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"A very nice day.. \" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>\n\n__Excursion -- The facility__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 074.jpg\">074</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 075.jpg\">075</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 076.jpg\">076</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 077.jpg\">077</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 078.jpg\">078</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 079.jpg\">079</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 080.jpg\">080</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 081.jpg\">081</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 082.jpg\">082</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 083.jpg\">083</a>\nThe facility itself was a very nice and new building with it's own little cove that housed 4 or 5 dolphins over looking the ocean.  The weather was nice, it was 75 or so.. which meant Melissa was cold (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 076.jpg\">076</a>).. (And hates it when I take pictures of her..)  But I mean seriously, this place was gorgeous (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 077.jpg\">077</a>) who wouldn't want to live someplace that looks like this?! (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 078.jpg\">078</a>) The scenery is just fantastic =) (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 081.jpg\">081</a>)\n\n__Excursion -- The dolphins__ :: *[No pictures available]*\nI don't have any pictures of us in the water or with the dolphins.  They refused to let me take those photos, or to take the under water camera in the water with the dolphins.  Their excuse was they didn't want us to hurt the animals, but I know the real reason was they wanted to sell us their pictures of us instead..  And of course since I was still suffering my shame from above, we couldn't purchase any..  So.. you'll have to trust me here.. there were lots of dolphins and it was fun.  I only wished there weren't as many people..  I kind of felt a tad rushed due to the size of the group.. but what can you do.. it was a good experience.\n\n<a href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise%20089.jpg\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"cruise-089\" src=\"/images/2009/04/cruise-089-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Friendly critter.. \" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>\n\n__Excursion -- Oh dear god, please don't hurt me__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 086.jpg\">086</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 087.jpg\">087</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 088.jpg\">088</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 089.jpg\">089</a>\nOn the way back to the bus after the excursion I wandered through the exotic bird area and and made a new friend! (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 086.jpg\">086</a>)  This bird was extremely friendly.. (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 087.jpg\">087</a>) Maybe too friendly.. (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 088.jpg\">088</a>)  That bird tongued me!  (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 089.jpg\">089</a>)  And sat on my shoulder nibbling my ear.. I say nibbling, I mean licking.. if that bird had \"nibbled\" she would have ripped my ear right off.. that beak was sharp as hell..\n\n__Tendered -- Tired__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 090.jpg\">090</a>\nYet again after a long day ashore and playing with the animals, we were pretty zonked.. It's odd to me that you can get as tired as we got each time considering how long these excursions were.. I mean we probably spent 5 or 6 hours doing each one and usually that was enough to do us in..  Naps for everyone!\n\n<a class='pull-right fancybox' rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise%20091.jpg\"><img title=\"cruise-091\" src=\"/images/2009/04/cruise-091-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Wow... \" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>\n\n__Tendered -- Sunsets .. again__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 091.jpg\">091</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 093.jpg\">093</a>\nDid I mention how pretty it was there?  Even the sun looked better.. Compare these sunsets to those in Cozumel.. Yeah these win..\n\n__Tendered -- Money!__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 096.jpg\">096</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 094.jpg\">094</a>\nThere is a lot of money in the Cayman Islands.  You can tell by the property and houses people have, the cars they drive, the boats they own and the fact that every 30 feet is a bank. And I mean a big bank.  There were quite a few hovels too but most of the island had nice stuff on it.  This one yacht was roughly half a mile away (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 096.jpg\">096</a>) and looked nice (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 094.jpg\">94</a>) (Though the picture is terrible.. digital zoom sucks.)  It was just the right size to be someones personal home at sea..  Oh to dream..\n\n__Under way -- Leaving Cayman__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 095.jpg\">095</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 097.jpg\">097</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 101.jpg\">101</a>\nAs the sun went down everyone gathered back on board and we prepared to leave..  We returned to the room after a nice tiring day to find a stingray on the bed.. (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 101.jpg\">101</a>) We did the dinner thing with our friends, and then rounded out the night with a nice long sleep..\n\n<a class='pull-right fancybox' rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise%20114.jpg\"><img title=\"cruise-114\" src=\"/images/2009/04/cruise-114-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Jamaica\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>\n\n###Day Five -- Jamaica\nOn day five we woke up to find ourselves already in port.  They hadn't cast down the moring lines yet, but we were basically completely parked.  I didn't care for Jamaica as much as I did Grand Cayman, though it was better than Cozumel.\n\n__In port -- Ya man!__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 102.jpg\">102</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 103.jpg\">103</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 104.jpg\">104</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 105.jpg\">105</a>\nIt was a beautiful day in Jamaica and the view from our balcony was a very nice one.\n\n__In Port -- To the excursion!__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 106.jpg\">106</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 107.jpg\">107</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 108.jpg\">108</a>\nJamaica was really very nice.. The weather was beautiful and there were boats everywhere..  We made our way to the back of our ship (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 108.jpg\">108</a>) and boarded our excursion boat.\n\n__Excursion -- Cruise and Snorkel fun__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 109.jpg\">109</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 111.jpg\">111</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 112.jpg\">112</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 134.jpg\">134</a>\nJamaica was nice and the people were friendly, but I was fairly unimpressed by the excursion selection.  It seemed all the excursions were some form of \"let us take you to this shopping area\".. We chose a cruise and snorkel type excursion with intent to enjoy the cruise, and get wet in which we didn't feel pressured to buy anything. They did have a para-sailing thing that I thought would be fun as hell but Melissa vetoed that cause she has an issue with heights.. Drat..\n\n__Excursion -- Beach__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 113.jpg\">113</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 115.jpg\">115</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 116.jpg\">116</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 117.jpg\">117</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Excursion 029.jpg\">E29</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Excursion 030.jpg\">E30</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Excursion 031.jpg\">E31</a>\nWe cruised across the bay to a beach area and unloaded half the passengers.  Some folks just wanted to go hang out at the beach, and I have to admit I'm sorry we didn't.  I think at this point we were a bit \"fun\"'d out and a nice relax on the beach would have gone over well..  Live and learn.  It was a very pretty beach with nice scenery (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 116.jpg\">116</a>) and ample to drink (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 117.jpg\">117</a>)..\n\n__Excursion -- Cruise and Sandals Resort &amp; Overcast__\nWe cruised around for a bit and the water started to get quite choppy.. I think I turned a shade of green.. We went past the Sandals beach resort blaring our music.. The Sandals beach resort didn't look that nice to be honest.. I mean it sorta looked like the beach photos above but not as pretty..  I think much of that had to do with the fact that some clouds had moved in and everything had a grey over cast look to it.. We tooled around for almost an hour..\n\n<a class='pull-right fancybox' rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Excursion%20033.jpg\"><img title=\"excursion-033\" src=\"/images/2009/04/excursion-033-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Wardrobe Malfunction\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>\n\n__Excursion -- In the water!__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Excursion 032.jpg\">E32</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Excursion 033.jpg\"> E33</a>\n*Again, crappy underwater camera..

Now prior to this I thought the equipment in Mexico was bad.. Wow.. the stuff they gave us to use was complete crap.  Everything was on it's last leg.  And we didn't get to swim for very long.  I wasn't very happy with this excursion and was glad when it was over.\n\n__Excursion -- Margaritaville__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 123.jpg\">123</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 124.jpg\">124</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 125.jpg\">125</a>\nEventually they headed back towards the ship (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 123.jpg\">123</a>) and we stopped at Margaritaville (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 124.jpg\">124</a>), and yes there is a Burger King right next door (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 125.jpg\">125</a>).. This was nice actually we found a table and sat down to enjoy the music and atmosphere while drinking possibly one of the biggest and strongest margarita's I've ever had.. It was yummy.. (we got to keep the glasses too..)\n\n<a class='pull-right fancybox' rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise%20129.jpg\"><img title=\"cruise-129\" src=\"/images/2009/04/cruise-129-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Local Jamaican band\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>\n\n__Excursion -- Local Singers__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 126.jpg\">126</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 127.jpg\">127</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 128.jpg\">128</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 129.jpg\">129</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 130.jpg\">130</a>\nA small group of singers walked up passed out some home made maraca's so we could join in the fun! Melissa took too it like a pro.. (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 126.jpg\">126</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 128.jpg\">128</a>)  These guys were great.. And it was a lot of fun watching and hearing them play.  And apparently Melissa likes me (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 130.jpg\">130</a>), there's no accounting for taste.. =p\n\n__Excursion -- View from the 'ville__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 131.jpg\">131</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 132.jpg\">132</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 133.jpg\">133</a>\nThe view from Margaritaville was nice, and you can see we aren't that far from our ship.  You could watch others having fun on their excursions (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 134.jpg\">134</a>) too.  From here you could see all the para-sailing people, and there were quite a fiew, as well as the jet ski's which I some how managed to not get a photo of..\n\n__Excursion -- The return__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 135.jpg\">135</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 136.jpg\">136</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 137.jpg\">137</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 138.jpg\">138</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 139.jpg\">139</a>\nEventually it was time to head back to the ship as both of us were tired.. Several hours of sun, surf and drinking will take it out of you..  I turned and snapped one last shot of Margaritaville as we pulled away (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 136.jpg\">136</a>).  The scenery was nice though and the water was very blue (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 138.jpg\">138</a>) the captain and crew of this little boat were a laugh riot and helped make the trip all that much more fun.. I tried to take pictures of them but none of them turned out.. =/\n\n__Excursion -- Sideways!__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 140.jpg\">140</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 141.jpg\">141</a>\n*Turn monitor sidways --- or head if you're lazy!*\nWe had fun though.. Melissa was tired so I took a snap of her and then she figured out what I was doing.. Doh.. hehe She's so cute..\n\n__In port -- Back aboard__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 142.jpg\">142</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 143.jpg\">143</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 149.jpg\">149</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 150.jpg\">150</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 152.jpg\">152</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 153.jpg\">153</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 154.jpg\">154</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 156.jpg\">156</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 157.jpg\">157</a>\nAs the day wound down I wandered around the top of the ship taking pictures of whatever suited my fancy.. There were any number of nice sail boats all over the place.. I mean seriously, its like everyone had one.. (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 154.jpg\">154</a>)\n\n<a class='pull-right fancybox' rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise%20146.jpg\"><img title=\"cruise-146\" src=\"/images/2009/04/cruise-146-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Sunset, Jamaica style!\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>\n\n__In port -- Sunset!!__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 146.jpg\">146</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 148.jpg\">148</a>\nI don't have a good sunset picture from Jamaica.. The mountains blocked the sun setting over the sea and really the clouds moved in to make it kind of dull.. These were the best I could do.. Still I think these are pretty darn nice.  It really was a beautiful place, but I still think Grand Cayman was better.\n\n###Day Six/Seven -- On the way home\nAnd so back under way we go.. On our way home back through the gulf heading North towards Houston.  Joy.\n\n__Under way -- The open ocean__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 163.jpg\">163</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 164.jpg\">164</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 165.jpg\">165</a>\nThe weather up to this point was gorgeous and to be honest it never got bad.  But it did get overcast and cloudy the last couple days on our way back to Houston.  Almost like the Gulf was pouting that we were going home.. heh\n\n__Under way -- Monkey!__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 166.jpg\">166</a>\n...a Monkey (and some towel animal.. )\n\n__Under way -- Last formal dinner__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 167.jpg\">167</a>\nProbably going to be in trouble for that last comment, so.. Whoa.. Hot chick.. (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 167.jpg\">167</a>)  One would think I beat my wife... Some how on this trip she got all bruised up.. You can't really see it but on her leg was this nasty purple bruise that ran from her ankle half way up her calf..  She got it in Jamaica and it took almost a week to go away..\n\n__The best waitress ever -- Renata Tadic__ :: [Pictures coming]\nI'd like to take a moment to tell you about our dinners and specifically our waitress.   Each night of the cruise we would gather in one of the 3 huge dining areas in order to sit down for supper.\n\nWe had 5 couples at our table the first night.  One couple decided they didn't want to be friendly and left before Melissa and I arrived.  Which left; Melissa and I, my friends Calvin and Karen, Sam Grien and his wife Rosemary, and their friend Dave {who's last name I'm not sure I ever got} and his girlfriend Susan.  We were easily the loudest and most obnoxious table on the whole boat.. Good times!\n\nEach night Renata Tadic, a 27ish year old woman from somewhere in Croatia, would greet us with a smile on her face that was completely genuine..  She would recommend food and was generally playful with us..  She was an absolute delightful woman and an excellent waitress..  The thing that I liked the most was that she was friendly and genuine.. Many of the employees on the boat were nice, and pleasant without being genuine.. You could tell that this was a job for them and they couldn't give a crap about you, where as with Renata you actually felt important.  You could really tell that this person enjoyed what they did and took pride in doing a good job..   In my mind it was a sign of a good waitress and a good person.  (By the end of the cruise Sam was trying to interest her in his son... hehe)\n\nWhen we got loud and obnoxious, she joined right in!  If you wanted something, she got it!  Even if it was something that was difficult for one reason or another..   Most importantly, she did an excellent job rounding off each day and making sure we left the table happy.\n\nThe food was always very good, but the service was what made the experience fantastic and did more to endear me to the cruise lines as a whole.   It's interesting how one person could have such a dramatic influence over an experience.  Renata made the trip so much more enjoyable than it would have been had we had some waiter who didn't care.\n\nThank you, Renata.\n\n###The End\n\nAnd that's really it for pictures.. There are a couple more on Melissas camera that I need to get to as well as getting some from Calvin and Karen but I'm out.  At this point the cruise was really over as all we did from here was to cruise back to port in Houston over the course of the next couple days and go home..\n\nSome have commented that there aren't very many pictures of me.. and that's true.. The primary reason being, I was the one with the camera.  Now Melissa had a nice camera too (nicer than mine actually) but she didn't take too many photos with it.. *shrug*\n\nI have to be honest, at this point in the cruise, I was kind of done.  We had a great time, but 7 days onboard ship in this tiny cabin, no matter how much other stuff there is to do, is a bit excessive.   I would very much do it again though, and certainly recommend others to do it.. It was totally worth it..\n","collection":"posts","url":"/2009cruise/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2009-04-06-2009-penny-redesign.md","collection":"posts","url":"/2009-penny-redesign/","path":"_posts/2009-04-06-2009-penny-redesign.md","id":"/2009-penny-redesign","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"2009 Penny Redesign","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2009/04/2009pennyuncobvthumb.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-04-06 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"2009-penny-redesign","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2009-04-03-2009cruise.md","excerpt":"So I have been asked repeatedly when am I going to get these photos posted..

I have to apologize that its taken this long..  My only real excuse is that I'm lazy..  I could lie and say it took a while to get them developed, but it's a digital camera.. In reality the thing that took the longest was having a clear way to display them.  The lightbox made that happen, then it was just a matter of typing this stuff out. It's a long post.. but then it was 7 days of fun so.. lots to talk about..\n\nBelow I give a day by day break down of what the photos are as well as where / what we were doing at the time of the photo.  Each heading will have all the photos for that section and some of them will be explained further within the body of the text giving the same link again.\n\n**Note: Clicking the photo link will open the photo in a lightbox internal to this page.

There were a lot of folks crammed into a fairly large building all trying to get on the ship.  What I didn't realize until we came back was that on the opposite side of the building there were a lot of people trying to get off the ship.  This is a 24 hour, 7 day a week operation that goes non-stop.   The ship is never empty.  I guess in order to turn a profit it has to go go go!  Looking back I kinda felt it could do with some streamlining.. Now I think they did an amazing job all things considered.\n\nWe drove to the dock, turned over our luggage, went and parked the car, rode the bus to the ship, entered the terminal, passed customs (or whatever it is) and boarded the ship.  It all took probably 2 hours, but it went fairly quickly.\n\n__In port -- Houston Ship Channel__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 001.jpg\">001</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 002.jpg\">002</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 003.jpg\">003</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 004.jpg\">004</a>\nUpon getting in the cabin, I walked out on our balcony and started snapping off a couple pics of the scenery around us.. Not so pretty..\n\n__In port -- The Cabin__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 005.jpg\">005</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 006.jpg\">006</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 007.jpg\">007</a>\nThe cabin itself upon entering seemed incredibly small -- and in fact was extremely tiny.. But to be honest, there was actually plenty of room considering we only slept there..  The bathroom (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 007.jpg\">007</a>) was not a lot bigger than an airplane lavatory, but served its purposes nicely.. Though you pretty much had to go out side to change your mind.\n\n__<a class='pull-right fancybox' rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise%20009.jpg\"><img title=\"cruise-009\" src=\"/images/2009/04/cruise-009-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"I feel safer already...\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>__\n\n__In port -- The illusion of safety__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 008.jpg\">008</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 009.jpg\">009</a>\nBefore we leave port they have all five thousand people (or however many there are.. it's near 5k) don life jackets and go to their assigned safety area in order to evacuate the ship in case of an emergency..  It was just a drill, and a complete sham.. Everyone was moving in this calm cool demeanor like nothing was going on -- this is just another fun excursion..  All of us lined up in our assigned area behind our given life boat.. Each boat was expected to hold about 100 people.. It was about then I realize that there was NO WAY IN HELL those boats would hold as many people as were standing next to them..  That's when I considered that in real life there would be mass panic and half those folks wouldn't get to the boat due to trample damage.. thus making room in the life boat..\n\n__Under way -- Houston Ship Channel__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 010.jpg\">010</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 011.jpg\">011</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 012.jpg\">012</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 013.jpg\">013</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 016.jpg\">016</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 018.jpg\">018</a>\nIt didn't get much prettier as we got under way but atleast the sky was starting to clear up.  As the ship started it's azipod impellers it churned up a lot of the muck and crap in the water (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 012.jpg\">012</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 016.jpg\">016</a>).. anyone up for a swim? (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 013.jpg\">013</a>)  I'm sure the birds wouldn't mind. Or the sharks!! (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 017.jpg\">017</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 018.jpg\">018</a>) (Okay those are actually dolphin or porpoise..)\n\n__Under way -- Ships in the Channel__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 020.jpg\">020</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 021.jpg\">021</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 022.jpg\">022</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 023.jpg\">023</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 024.jpg\">024</a>\nAs we headed out of the shipping channel heading into the gulf, we got to see a LOT of ships.. The funny thing is, my days playing submarine games made me think of how I would go about sinking these ships.. heh  Still it was neat to see these massive ships go about their business..\n\n__Under way -- Leaving the Channel__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 025.jpg\">025</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 026.jpg\">026</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 027.jpg\">027</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 028.jpg\">028</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 029.jpg\">029</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 030.jpg\">030</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 031.jpg\">031</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 032.jpg\">032</a>\nLooking back at Houston the shoreline actually looks kind of pretty.. It's nasty as ever but looks nice from this distance.. Nothing to do at this point but enjoy the cruise and look to the open ocean (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 032.jpg\">032</a>).\n\n__Under way -- Harbor master departs__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 033.jpg\">033</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 034.jpg\">034</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 035.jpg\">035</a>\nSo there was a little ship following us the whole way out of port which I assumed was the harbor guide.. What I didn't know was that we actually had a person on board that would have to get off and go back to Houston.  Once we got into the gulf, and I mean a good way out, the little ship ran itself right up against our hull and the guy got off..  it was interesting to watch but I wasn't able to get any good shots of it.. It was dark so I had to fiddle with the camera settings to get what I got.. Sorry for the poor quality of these.\n\n###Day Two -- On the way to Cozumel, Mexico\nWe didn't do a lot on day one but wander around the ship getting to know our surroundings.  We met our dinner companions and generally had a fun time.  It was a quiet and relaxing day.\n\n__Under way -- Holy crap the water is blue?!__ ::  <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 036.jpg\">036</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 037.jpg\">037</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 038.jpg\">038</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 039.jpg\">039</a>\nSo.. you wouldn't know it to stare at the water in Houston, but the water out in the ocean is actually blue!! (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 037.jpg\">037</a>)  I mean blue like they poured food coloring in it.. heh  I woke up to a very blue ocean outside (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 038.jpg\">038</a>) and an absolutely beautiful day (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 039.jpg\">039</a>).  We were very lucky in that our entire trip consisted of days like this. It didn't get overcast until the very last day back.\n\n__Under way -- Wandering around the ship__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 040.jpg\">040</a>\nHoly crap this boat was huge..  To give you some idea, it's a 15 story building at sea.  It had 15 stories ABOVE the water line, and 3 or 4 below.  It had a HUGE theatre in the center, an ice rink, and most importantly a strip mall (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 040.jpg\">040</a>) that runs down the center of the boat..\n\n__Under way -- The occasional passer-by__ ::  <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 043.jpg\">043</a>\nI thought it was interesting that as vast as the ocean and the gulf is, we still occasionally saw other ships.. That tells me that either everyone travels along the same routes, or the ocean is full!\n\n<a class='pull-right fancybox' rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise%20041.jpg\"><img title=\"cruise-041\" src=\"/images/2009/04/cruise-041-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Magestic Sunsets\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>\n\n__Under way -- Sunsets__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 041.jpg\">041</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 042.jpg\">042</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 044.jpg\">044</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 045.jpg\">045</a>\nSomething I had looked forward to was being able to stand on the top of the ship and look around and see no land.  I wanted to see the ocean in all it's glory.. Holy crap.. It was absolutely beautiful out there..  The sunsets were amazing..\n\nI don't think I'm good enough of a photographer to truly bring the beauty of these sunsets to film.. I also didn't really have the camera to pull it off.. but it was nice let me tell ya..\n\nOver all this was a very good day.  Melissa and I got to enjoy one another's company on a ship that while full, didn't seem overly crowded.  When we wanted to be alone we would retire to the cabin.. other wise we were just wandering around.\n\nThere was ample to do in that each day they booked all manner of on board activities.. We didn't do too many of those mostly because we wanted to do our own thing..\n\n<a class='pull-right fancybox' rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise%20052.jpg\"><img title=\"cruise-052\" src=\"/images/2009/04/cruise-052-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Mexico!\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>\n\n###Day Three -- Cozumel, Mexico\nSo on day three, we pulled into Cozumel.\n\n__In port -- These ships are massive__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 040.jpg\">040</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 046.jpg\">046</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 047.jpg\">047</a>\nIt's hard to describe how large these ships are.. And in fact when you're on them you tend to compare them to the vastness of the ocean which makes them seem some what smallish.. but let me tell ya, they are anything but small.. As I pointed out above while wandering around, this ship is so big it has a street running down the center of it (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 040.jpg\">040</a>).. but what I think really shows it's size is when you see people standing next to it (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 046.jpg\">046</a>)..  There was a Carnival Cruise ship docked near by and its not anywhere near as big (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 047.jpg\">047</a>).  You can't tell really by the photo but it's smaller in every way.\n\n<a class='pull-right fancybox' rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Excursion%20018.jpg\"><img title=\"excursion-018\" src=\"/images/2009/04/excursion-018-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"She's so cute.. \" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>\n\n__Excursion -- <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Why_of_Fry\" target=\"_blank\">\"Scooty puff jr. sucks!!\"</a>__ ::\n* Most of these photos are poor quality due to the crappy underwater camera I got.

The crew of the excursion would scuba up and lead us around a small unimpressive reef while giving us critters to hold and taking our pictures..  It was pretty cool to be honest..  Not to mention down right cold..  The water was probably 68°F at best..  Which for me isn't too bad, but poor Melissa was shivering like a chihuahua.. She was basically one big goose bump..  The scooters were painfully slow.. They had ZERO power, and at one point we had divers behind us pushing hehe.. Thus, the reference to Futurama.. We called those things \"Scooty Puff Juniors\" for the rest of the trip..  The crew (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Excursion 027.jpg\">E27</a>) were really very nice and we didn't get very far from the ships (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Excursion 026.jpg\">E26</a>).. All in all it was a lot of fun, I very much enjoyed it even though the photos don't really tell much of a story.\n\n__In port -- Wandering around Cozumel__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 048.jpg\">048</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 049.jpg\">049</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 050.jpg\">050</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 051.jpg\">051</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 052.jpg\">052</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 053.jpg\">053</a>\nSo after our underwater fun, Melissa and I with my friends Calvin and Karen ended up wandering around Cozumel for the rest of the day.  We had a pretty good time, I mean we weren't mugged or anything.. but all in all I was fairly underwhelmed by Cozumel.  We ended up doing a LOT of walking and were quite tired by the end of it all (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 053.jpg\">053</a>)..  It was a long day..\n\n__In port -- Pictures of the coast__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 054.jpg\">054</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 055.jpg\">055</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 056.jpg\">056</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 057.jpg\">057</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 058.jpg\">058</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 063.jpg\">063</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 064.jpg\">064</a>\nAfter our day of swimming, and walking we were pretty tired.. Melissa took a nap and I wandered around the top of the ship taking pictures as the ship pushed off from the pier.  This picture better shows how much smaller the Carnival ships are compared to the Royal Carribbean ships. (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 058.jpg\">058</a>) I'm not even at the highest point on the ship and you can see I'm above the top of the other ship.\n\n__Under way -- Please don't feed the humans__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 059.jpg\">059</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 060.jpg\">060</a>\nOne thing the I thought was very neat was that you could go and watch the captain and crew pilot the ship.  There was a viewing area above and behind them where you could watch.. and that was awesome.. I took a picture of it and was shocked that it sorta came out. (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 059.jpg\">059</a>) You can't see all the cool stuff on the screens but.. so be it..  Oh and I found it funny as hell that they had signs posted all over to \"Please do not knock on glass.\" (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 060.jpg\">060</a>)\n\n<a class='pull-right fancybox' rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise%20062.jpg\"><img title=\"cruise-062\" src=\"/images/2009/04/cruise-062-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Some God Rays\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>\n\n__Under way -- Everyone!! Off the island!__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 061.jpg\">061</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 062.jpg\">062</a>\nI found it interesting that each port we visited had all the ships coming and going at the same time..  This seemed odd to me as one would think it would put a strain on everyone involved.. but.. *shrug* that's how they did it..\n\n__Under way -- A dog in our room?!__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 065.jpg\">065</a>\nAfter dinner on the third day we arrived back in our cabin (they called it a suite!) to find a dog on the bed!!!  This is one of those cute things they do for everyone each night.  I'm pretty sure they would have done it on the previous nights but we had the \"do not disturb\" sign on the door.\n\n###Day Four -- Grand Cayman\nSo I'm going to be a bit biased here.. Grand Cayman was by far my favorite stop..  But it's TINY!  Grand Cayman was basically a dot on the map.. The whole of Grand Cayman is an island that spans a colossal 76 square miles (Austin, Texas occupies 272 square miles) and it had more to do and more things to see than any of the other stops.   There were so many excursions it was hard to choose just one.  And it was such a beautiful place I could see myself living there.. (That's saying something for me.. )\n\n__Under way -- On our way to tender__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 066.jpg\">066</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 067.jpg\">067</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 068.jpg\">068</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 069.jpg\">069</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 070.jpg\">070</a>\nGrand Cayman is so small they don't have piers or docks for ships as large as the one we were on.  (or smaller ones)  Instead you have to get on board a smaller boat called a tender (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 068.jpg\">068</a>) that brings you into shore. (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 069.jpg\">069</a>)  And man do they ever crowd folks on these boats.. (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 070.jpg\">070</a>)   This aint the US where those pesky safety regulations get in the way. hehe  I didn't feel unsafe though.\n\n__Tendered -- Shopping! .. er.. okay maybe not__ :: *[No pictures of my shame]*\nInstead, what I felt like was a complete ass..  When you get on board the ship they issue everyone a card they call the \"Sea Pass\" with which you do everything.   It becomes your passport proxy as well as your credit card.  This one card allows you to do everything..  But of course it only works aboard ship.   I had gotten so used to just whipping out my sea pass that I completely forgot to bring my wallet to shore..   This meant we couldn't purchase anything while in Grand Cayman..\n\nI felt very very bad.  I was generally pissy for a couple hours because I know there were things Melissa wanted and that I couldn't provide for her because my dumb ass had forgotten the money..  I'm not sure how to convey to you the frustration I felt at myself over this..  I was very apologetic to Melissa and she said she understood, but I could tell she was disappointed.\n\nI promised to bring her back to Grand Cayman one day so she could do the shopping she wanted to do =)   Hell there was things I wanted too!\n\n__Excursion -- Dolphins ... and Birds?!__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 071.jpg\">071</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 072.jpg\">072</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 073.jpg\">073</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 084.jpg\">084</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 085.jpg\">085</a>\nAs I had stated above, there were a lot of excursions to choose from and due to time and the nature of these cruises we really could only do one per stop.  Melissa and I decided to do a \"Swim with the dolphins\" adventure type thing without Calvin and Karen.  They went on their own fun (and proceeded to get horribly sunburned..)  We got on a bus and were taken across the island to the dolphin facility.  The parking area was on the opposite side of a foresty area that we had to walk through and it was chalk full of exotic birds..  They were very friendly birds and would happily let us take pictures..\n\n<a class='pull-right fancybox' rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise%20077.jpg\"><img title=\"cruise-077\" src=\"/images/2009/04/cruise-077-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"A very nice day.. \" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>\n\n__Excursion -- The facility__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 074.jpg\">074</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 075.jpg\">075</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 076.jpg\">076</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 077.jpg\">077</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 078.jpg\">078</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 079.jpg\">079</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 080.jpg\">080</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 081.jpg\">081</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 082.jpg\">082</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 083.jpg\">083</a>\nThe facility itself was a very nice and new building with it's own little cove that housed 4 or 5 dolphins over looking the ocean.  The weather was nice, it was 75 or so.. which meant Melissa was cold (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 076.jpg\">076</a>).. (And hates it when I take pictures of her..)  But I mean seriously, this place was gorgeous (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 077.jpg\">077</a>) who wouldn't want to live someplace that looks like this?! (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 078.jpg\">078</a>) The scenery is just fantastic =) (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 081.jpg\">081</a>)\n\n__Excursion -- The dolphins__ :: *[No pictures available]*\nI don't have any pictures of us in the water or with the dolphins.  They refused to let me take those photos, or to take the under water camera in the water with the dolphins.  Their excuse was they didn't want us to hurt the animals, but I know the real reason was they wanted to sell us their pictures of us instead..  And of course since I was still suffering my shame from above, we couldn't purchase any..  So.. you'll have to trust me here.. there were lots of dolphins and it was fun.  I only wished there weren't as many people..  I kind of felt a tad rushed due to the size of the group.. but what can you do.. it was a good experience.\n\n<a href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise%20089.jpg\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"cruise-089\" src=\"/images/2009/04/cruise-089-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Friendly critter.. \" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>\n\n__Excursion -- Oh dear god, please don't hurt me__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 086.jpg\">086</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 087.jpg\">087</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 088.jpg\">088</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 089.jpg\">089</a>\nOn the way back to the bus after the excursion I wandered through the exotic bird area and and made a new friend! (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 086.jpg\">086</a>)  This bird was extremely friendly.. (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 087.jpg\">087</a>) Maybe too friendly.. (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 088.jpg\">088</a>)  That bird tongued me!  (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 089.jpg\">089</a>)  And sat on my shoulder nibbling my ear.. I say nibbling, I mean licking.. if that bird had \"nibbled\" she would have ripped my ear right off.. that beak was sharp as hell..\n\n__Tendered -- Tired__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 090.jpg\">090</a>\nYet again after a long day ashore and playing with the animals, we were pretty zonked.. It's odd to me that you can get as tired as we got each time considering how long these excursions were.. I mean we probably spent 5 or 6 hours doing each one and usually that was enough to do us in..  Naps for everyone!\n\n<a class='pull-right fancybox' rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise%20091.jpg\"><img title=\"cruise-091\" src=\"/images/2009/04/cruise-091-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Wow... \" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>\n\n__Tendered -- Sunsets .. again__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 091.jpg\">091</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 093.jpg\">093</a>\nDid I mention how pretty it was there?  Even the sun looked better.. Compare these sunsets to those in Cozumel.. Yeah these win..\n\n__Tendered -- Money!__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 096.jpg\">096</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 094.jpg\">094</a>\nThere is a lot of money in the Cayman Islands.  You can tell by the property and houses people have, the cars they drive, the boats they own and the fact that every 30 feet is a bank. And I mean a big bank.  There were quite a few hovels too but most of the island had nice stuff on it.  This one yacht was roughly half a mile away (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 096.jpg\">096</a>) and looked nice (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 094.jpg\">94</a>) (Though the picture is terrible.. digital zoom sucks.)  It was just the right size to be someones personal home at sea..  Oh to dream..\n\n__Under way -- Leaving Cayman__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 095.jpg\">095</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 097.jpg\">097</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 101.jpg\">101</a>\nAs the sun went down everyone gathered back on board and we prepared to leave..  We returned to the room after a nice tiring day to find a stingray on the bed.. (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 101.jpg\">101</a>) We did the dinner thing with our friends, and then rounded out the night with a nice long sleep..\n\n<a class='pull-right fancybox' rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise%20114.jpg\"><img title=\"cruise-114\" src=\"/images/2009/04/cruise-114-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Jamaica\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>\n\n###Day Five -- Jamaica\nOn day five we woke up to find ourselves already in port.  They hadn't cast down the moring lines yet, but we were basically completely parked.  I didn't care for Jamaica as much as I did Grand Cayman, though it was better than Cozumel.\n\n__In port -- Ya man!__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 102.jpg\">102</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 103.jpg\">103</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 104.jpg\">104</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 105.jpg\">105</a>\nIt was a beautiful day in Jamaica and the view from our balcony was a very nice one.\n\n__In Port -- To the excursion!__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 106.jpg\">106</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 107.jpg\">107</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 108.jpg\">108</a>\nJamaica was really very nice.. The weather was beautiful and there were boats everywhere..  We made our way to the back of our ship (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 108.jpg\">108</a>) and boarded our excursion boat.\n\n__Excursion -- Cruise and Snorkel fun__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 109.jpg\">109</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 111.jpg\">111</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 112.jpg\">112</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 134.jpg\">134</a>\nJamaica was nice and the people were friendly, but I was fairly unimpressed by the excursion selection.  It seemed all the excursions were some form of \"let us take you to this shopping area\".. We chose a cruise and snorkel type excursion with intent to enjoy the cruise, and get wet in which we didn't feel pressured to buy anything. They did have a para-sailing thing that I thought would be fun as hell but Melissa vetoed that cause she has an issue with heights.. Drat..\n\n__Excursion -- Beach__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 113.jpg\">113</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 115.jpg\">115</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 116.jpg\">116</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 117.jpg\">117</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Excursion 029.jpg\">E29</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Excursion 030.jpg\">E30</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Excursion 031.jpg\">E31</a>\nWe cruised across the bay to a beach area and unloaded half the passengers.  Some folks just wanted to go hang out at the beach, and I have to admit I'm sorry we didn't.  I think at this point we were a bit \"fun\"'d out and a nice relax on the beach would have gone over well..  Live and learn.  It was a very pretty beach with nice scenery (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 116.jpg\">116</a>) and ample to drink (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 117.jpg\">117</a>)..\n\n__Excursion -- Cruise and Sandals Resort &amp; Overcast__\nWe cruised around for a bit and the water started to get quite choppy.. I think I turned a shade of green.. We went past the Sandals beach resort blaring our music.. The Sandals beach resort didn't look that nice to be honest.. I mean it sorta looked like the beach photos above but not as pretty..  I think much of that had to do with the fact that some clouds had moved in and everything had a grey over cast look to it.. We tooled around for almost an hour..\n\n<a class='pull-right fancybox' rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Excursion%20033.jpg\"><img title=\"excursion-033\" src=\"/images/2009/04/excursion-033-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Wardrobe Malfunction\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>\n\n__Excursion -- In the water!__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Excursion 032.jpg\">E32</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Excursion 033.jpg\"> E33</a>\n*Again, crappy underwater camera..

Now prior to this I thought the equipment in Mexico was bad.. Wow.. the stuff they gave us to use was complete crap.  Everything was on it's last leg.  And we didn't get to swim for very long.  I wasn't very happy with this excursion and was glad when it was over.\n\n__Excursion -- Margaritaville__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 123.jpg\">123</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 124.jpg\">124</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 125.jpg\">125</a>\nEventually they headed back towards the ship (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 123.jpg\">123</a>) and we stopped at Margaritaville (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 124.jpg\">124</a>), and yes there is a Burger King right next door (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 125.jpg\">125</a>).. This was nice actually we found a table and sat down to enjoy the music and atmosphere while drinking possibly one of the biggest and strongest margarita's I've ever had.. It was yummy.. (we got to keep the glasses too..)\n\n<a class='pull-right fancybox' rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise%20129.jpg\"><img title=\"cruise-129\" src=\"/images/2009/04/cruise-129-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Local Jamaican band\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>\n\n__Excursion -- Local Singers__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 126.jpg\">126</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 127.jpg\">127</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 128.jpg\">128</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 129.jpg\">129</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 130.jpg\">130</a>\nA small group of singers walked up passed out some home made maraca's so we could join in the fun! Melissa took too it like a pro.. (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 126.jpg\">126</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 128.jpg\">128</a>)  These guys were great.. And it was a lot of fun watching and hearing them play.  And apparently Melissa likes me (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 130.jpg\">130</a>), there's no accounting for taste.. =p\n\n__Excursion -- View from the 'ville__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 131.jpg\">131</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 132.jpg\">132</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 133.jpg\">133</a>\nThe view from Margaritaville was nice, and you can see we aren't that far from our ship.  You could watch others having fun on their excursions (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 134.jpg\">134</a>) too.  From here you could see all the para-sailing people, and there were quite a fiew, as well as the jet ski's which I some how managed to not get a photo of..\n\n__Excursion -- The return__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 135.jpg\">135</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 136.jpg\">136</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 137.jpg\">137</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 138.jpg\">138</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 139.jpg\">139</a>\nEventually it was time to head back to the ship as both of us were tired.. Several hours of sun, surf and drinking will take it out of you..  I turned and snapped one last shot of Margaritaville as we pulled away (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 136.jpg\">136</a>).  The scenery was nice though and the water was very blue (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 138.jpg\">138</a>) the captain and crew of this little boat were a laugh riot and helped make the trip all that much more fun.. I tried to take pictures of them but none of them turned out.. =/\n\n__Excursion -- Sideways!__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 140.jpg\">140</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 141.jpg\">141</a>\n*Turn monitor sidways --- or head if you're lazy!*\nWe had fun though.. Melissa was tired so I took a snap of her and then she figured out what I was doing.. Doh.. hehe She's so cute..\n\n__In port -- Back aboard__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 142.jpg\">142</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 143.jpg\">143</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 149.jpg\">149</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 150.jpg\">150</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 152.jpg\">152</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 153.jpg\">153</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 154.jpg\">154</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 156.jpg\">156</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 157.jpg\">157</a>\nAs the day wound down I wandered around the top of the ship taking pictures of whatever suited my fancy.. There were any number of nice sail boats all over the place.. I mean seriously, its like everyone had one.. (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 154.jpg\">154</a>)\n\n<a class='pull-right fancybox' rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise%20146.jpg\"><img title=\"cruise-146\" src=\"/images/2009/04/cruise-146-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Sunset, Jamaica style!\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>\n\n__In port -- Sunset!!__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 146.jpg\">146</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 148.jpg\">148</a>\nI don't have a good sunset picture from Jamaica.. The mountains blocked the sun setting over the sea and really the clouds moved in to make it kind of dull.. These were the best I could do.. Still I think these are pretty darn nice.  It really was a beautiful place, but I still think Grand Cayman was better.\n\n###Day Six/Seven -- On the way home\nAnd so back under way we go.. On our way home back through the gulf heading North towards Houston.  Joy.\n\n__Under way -- The open ocean__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 163.jpg\">163</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 164.jpg\">164</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 165.jpg\">165</a>\nThe weather up to this point was gorgeous and to be honest it never got bad.  But it did get overcast and cloudy the last couple days on our way back to Houston.  Almost like the Gulf was pouting that we were going home.. heh\n\n__Under way -- Monkey!__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 166.jpg\">166</a>\n...a Monkey (and some towel animal.. )\n\n__Under way -- Last formal dinner__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 167.jpg\">167</a>\nProbably going to be in trouble for that last comment, so.. Whoa.. Hot chick.. (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 167.jpg\">167</a>)  One would think I beat my wife... Some how on this trip she got all bruised up.. You can't really see it but on her leg was this nasty purple bruise that ran from her ankle half way up her calf..  She got it in Jamaica and it took almost a week to go away..\n\n__The best waitress ever -- Renata Tadic__ :: [Pictures coming]\nI'd like to take a moment to tell you about our dinners and specifically our waitress.   Each night of the cruise we would gather in one of the 3 huge dining areas in order to sit down for supper.\n\nWe had 5 couples at our table the first night.  One couple decided they didn't want to be friendly and left before Melissa and I arrived.  Which left; Melissa and I, my friends Calvin and Karen, Sam Grien and his wife Rosemary, and their friend Dave {who's last name I'm not sure I ever got} and his girlfriend Susan.  We were easily the loudest and most obnoxious table on the whole boat.. Good times!\n\nEach night Renata Tadic, a 27ish year old woman from somewhere in Croatia, would greet us with a smile on her face that was completely genuine..  She would recommend food and was generally playful with us..  She was an absolute delightful woman and an excellent waitress..  The thing that I liked the most was that she was friendly and genuine.. Many of the employees on the boat were nice, and pleasant without being genuine.. You could tell that this was a job for them and they couldn't give a crap about you, where as with Renata you actually felt important.  You could really tell that this person enjoyed what they did and took pride in doing a good job..   In my mind it was a sign of a good waitress and a good person.  (By the end of the cruise Sam was trying to interest her in his son... hehe)\n\nWhen we got loud and obnoxious, she joined right in!  If you wanted something, she got it!  Even if it was something that was difficult for one reason or another..   Most importantly, she did an excellent job rounding off each day and making sure we left the table happy.\n\nThe food was always very good, but the service was what made the experience fantastic and did more to endear me to the cruise lines as a whole.   It's interesting how one person could have such a dramatic influence over an experience.  Renata made the trip so much more enjoyable than it would have been had we had some waiter who didn't care.\n\nThank you, Renata.\n\n###The End\n\nAnd that's really it for pictures.. There are a couple more on Melissas camera that I need to get to as well as getting some from Calvin and Karen but I'm out.  At this point the cruise was really over as all we did from here was to cruise back to port in Houston over the course of the next couple days and go home..\n\nSome have commented that there aren't very many pictures of me.. and that's true.. The primary reason being, I was the one with the camera.  Now Melissa had a nice camera too (nicer than mine actually) but she didn't take too many photos with it.. *shrug*\n\nI have to be honest, at this point in the cruise, I was kind of done.  We had a great time, but 7 days onboard ship in this tiny cabin, no matter how much other stuff there is to do, is a bit excessive.   I would very much do it again though, and certainly recommend others to do it.. It was totally worth it..\n","collection":"posts","url":"/2009cruise/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2009-03-22-mercedes-benz-clk350.md","collection":"posts","url":"/mercedes-benz-clk350/","path":"_posts/2009-03-22-mercedes-benz-clk350.md","id":"/mercedes-benz-clk350","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Mercedes-Benz CLK350","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2009/03/mb1-150x150.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-03-22 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"mercedes-benz-clk350","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2009-04-03-2009cruise.md","content":"<a class='pull-right fancybox' rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise%20046.jpg\"><img title=\"cruise-046\" src=\"/images/2009/04/cruise-046-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Voyager of the Seas\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>\n\nSo I have been asked repeatedly when am I going to get these photos posted.. I have to apologize that its taken this long..  My only real excuse is that I'm lazy..  I could lie and say it took a while to get them developed, but it's a digital camera.. In reality the thing that took the longest was having a clear way to display them.  The lightbox made that happen, then it was just a matter of typing this stuff out. It's a long post.. but then it was 7 days of fun so.. lots to talk about..\n\nBelow I give a day by day break down of what the photos are as well as where / what we were doing at the time of the photo.  Each heading will have all the photos for that section and some of them will be explained further within the body of the text giving the same link again.\n\n**Note: Clicking the photo link will open the photo in a lightbox internal to this page.  Click again to close.  If you want to see the full sized image then right click the link and open the photo in a new tab/window.**\n\n###__Day One -- Boarding of the ship__\n\nThis was a long process.. There were a lot of folks crammed into a fairly large building all trying to get on the ship.  What I didn't realize until we came back was that on the opposite side of the building there were a lot of people trying to get off the ship.  This is a 24 hour, 7 day a week operation that goes non-stop.   The ship is never empty.  I guess in order to turn a profit it has to go go go!  Looking back I kinda felt it could do with some streamlining.. Now I think they did an amazing job all things considered.\n\nWe drove to the dock, turned over our luggage, went and parked the car, rode the bus to the ship, entered the terminal, passed customs (or whatever it is) and boarded the ship.  It all took probably 2 hours, but it went fairly quickly.\n\n__In port -- Houston Ship Channel__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 001.jpg\">001</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 002.jpg\">002</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 003.jpg\">003</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 004.jpg\">004</a>\nUpon getting in the cabin, I walked out on our balcony and started snapping off a couple pics of the scenery around us.. Not so pretty..\n\n__In port -- The Cabin__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 005.jpg\">005</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 006.jpg\">006</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 007.jpg\">007</a>\nThe cabin itself upon entering seemed incredibly small -- and in fact was extremely tiny.. But to be honest, there was actually plenty of room considering we only slept there..  The bathroom (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 007.jpg\">007</a>) was not a lot bigger than an airplane lavatory, but served its purposes nicely.. Though you pretty much had to go out side to change your mind.\n\n__<a class='pull-right fancybox' rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise%20009.jpg\"><img title=\"cruise-009\" src=\"/images/2009/04/cruise-009-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"I feel safer already...\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>__\n\n__In port -- The illusion of safety__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 008.jpg\">008</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 009.jpg\">009</a>\nBefore we leave port they have all five thousand people (or however many there are.. it's near 5k) don life jackets and go to their assigned safety area in order to evacuate the ship in case of an emergency..  It was just a drill, and a complete sham.. Everyone was moving in this calm cool demeanor like nothing was going on -- this is just another fun excursion..  All of us lined up in our assigned area behind our given life boat.. Each boat was expected to hold about 100 people.. It was about then I realize that there was NO WAY IN HELL those boats would hold as many people as were standing next to them..  That's when I considered that in real life there would be mass panic and half those folks wouldn't get to the boat due to trample damage.. thus making room in the life boat..\n\n__Under way -- Houston Ship Channel__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 010.jpg\">010</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 011.jpg\">011</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 012.jpg\">012</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 013.jpg\">013</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 016.jpg\">016</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 018.jpg\">018</a>\nIt didn't get much prettier as we got under way but atleast the sky was starting to clear up.  As the ship started it's azipod impellers it churned up a lot of the muck and crap in the water (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 012.jpg\">012</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 016.jpg\">016</a>).. anyone up for a swim? (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 013.jpg\">013</a>)  I'm sure the birds wouldn't mind. Or the sharks!! (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 017.jpg\">017</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 018.jpg\">018</a>) (Okay those are actually dolphin or porpoise..)\n\n__Under way -- Ships in the Channel__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 020.jpg\">020</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 021.jpg\">021</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 022.jpg\">022</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 023.jpg\">023</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 024.jpg\">024</a>\nAs we headed out of the shipping channel heading into the gulf, we got to see a LOT of ships.. The funny thing is, my days playing submarine games made me think of how I would go about sinking these ships.. heh  Still it was neat to see these massive ships go about their business..\n\n__Under way -- Leaving the Channel__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 025.jpg\">025</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 026.jpg\">026</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 027.jpg\">027</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 028.jpg\">028</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 029.jpg\">029</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 030.jpg\">030</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 031.jpg\">031</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 032.jpg\">032</a>\nLooking back at Houston the shoreline actually looks kind of pretty.. It's nasty as ever but looks nice from this distance.. Nothing to do at this point but enjoy the cruise and look to the open ocean (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 032.jpg\">032</a>).\n\n__Under way -- Harbor master departs__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 033.jpg\">033</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 034.jpg\">034</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 035.jpg\">035</a>\nSo there was a little ship following us the whole way out of port which I assumed was the harbor guide.. What I didn't know was that we actually had a person on board that would have to get off and go back to Houston.  Once we got into the gulf, and I mean a good way out, the little ship ran itself right up against our hull and the guy got off..  it was interesting to watch but I wasn't able to get any good shots of it.. It was dark so I had to fiddle with the camera settings to get what I got.. Sorry for the poor quality of these.\n\n###Day Two -- On the way to Cozumel, Mexico\nWe didn't do a lot on day one but wander around the ship getting to know our surroundings.  We met our dinner companions and generally had a fun time.  It was a quiet and relaxing day.\n\n__Under way -- Holy crap the water is blue?!__ ::  <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 036.jpg\">036</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 037.jpg\">037</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 038.jpg\">038</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 039.jpg\">039</a>\nSo.. you wouldn't know it to stare at the water in Houston, but the water out in the ocean is actually blue!! (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 037.jpg\">037</a>)  I mean blue like they poured food coloring in it.. heh  I woke up to a very blue ocean outside (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 038.jpg\">038</a>) and an absolutely beautiful day (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 039.jpg\">039</a>).  We were very lucky in that our entire trip consisted of days like this. It didn't get overcast until the very last day back.\n\n__Under way -- Wandering around the ship__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 040.jpg\">040</a>\nHoly crap this boat was huge..  To give you some idea, it's a 15 story building at sea.  It had 15 stories ABOVE the water line, and 3 or 4 below.  It had a HUGE theatre in the center, an ice rink, and most importantly a strip mall (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 040.jpg\">040</a>) that runs down the center of the boat..\n\n__Under way -- The occasional passer-by__ ::  <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 043.jpg\">043</a>\nI thought it was interesting that as vast as the ocean and the gulf is, we still occasionally saw other ships.. That tells me that either everyone travels along the same routes, or the ocean is full!\n\n<a class='pull-right fancybox' rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise%20041.jpg\"><img title=\"cruise-041\" src=\"/images/2009/04/cruise-041-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Magestic Sunsets\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>\n\n__Under way -- Sunsets__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 041.jpg\">041</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 042.jpg\">042</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 044.jpg\">044</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 045.jpg\">045</a>\nSomething I had looked forward to was being able to stand on the top of the ship and look around and see no land.  I wanted to see the ocean in all it's glory.. Holy crap.. It was absolutely beautiful out there..  The sunsets were amazing..\n\nI don't think I'm good enough of a photographer to truly bring the beauty of these sunsets to film.. I also didn't really have the camera to pull it off.. but it was nice let me tell ya..\n\nOver all this was a very good day.  Melissa and I got to enjoy one another's company on a ship that while full, didn't seem overly crowded.  When we wanted to be alone we would retire to the cabin.. other wise we were just wandering around.\n\nThere was ample to do in that each day they booked all manner of on board activities.. We didn't do too many of those mostly because we wanted to do our own thing..\n\n<a class='pull-right fancybox' rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise%20052.jpg\"><img title=\"cruise-052\" src=\"/images/2009/04/cruise-052-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Mexico!\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>\n\n###Day Three -- Cozumel, Mexico\nSo on day three, we pulled into Cozumel.\n\n__In port -- These ships are massive__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 040.jpg\">040</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 046.jpg\">046</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 047.jpg\">047</a>\nIt's hard to describe how large these ships are.. And in fact when you're on them you tend to compare them to the vastness of the ocean which makes them seem some what smallish.. but let me tell ya, they are anything but small.. As I pointed out above while wandering around, this ship is so big it has a street running down the center of it (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 040.jpg\">040</a>).. but what I think really shows it's size is when you see people standing next to it (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 046.jpg\">046</a>)..  There was a Carnival Cruise ship docked near by and its not anywhere near as big (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 047.jpg\">047</a>).  You can't tell really by the photo but it's smaller in every way.\n\n<a class='pull-right fancybox' rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Excursion%20018.jpg\"><img title=\"excursion-018\" src=\"/images/2009/04/excursion-018-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"She's so cute.. \" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>\n\n__Excursion -- <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Why_of_Fry\" target=\"_blank\">\"Scooty puff jr. sucks!!\"</a>__ ::\n* Most of these photos are poor quality due to the crappy underwater camera I got.

The crew of the excursion would scuba up and lead us around a small unimpressive reef while giving us critters to hold and taking our pictures..  It was pretty cool to be honest..  Not to mention down right cold..  The water was probably 68°F at best..  Which for me isn't too bad, but poor Melissa was shivering like a chihuahua.. She was basically one big goose bump..  The scooters were painfully slow.. They had ZERO power, and at one point we had divers behind us pushing hehe.. Thus, the reference to Futurama.. We called those things \"Scooty Puff Juniors\" for the rest of the trip..  The crew (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Excursion 027.jpg\">E27</a>) were really very nice and we didn't get very far from the ships (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Excursion 026.jpg\">E26</a>).. All in all it was a lot of fun, I very much enjoyed it even though the photos don't really tell much of a story.\n\n__In port -- Wandering around Cozumel__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 048.jpg\">048</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 049.jpg\">049</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 050.jpg\">050</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 051.jpg\">051</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 052.jpg\">052</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 053.jpg\">053</a>\nSo after our underwater fun, Melissa and I with my friends Calvin and Karen ended up wandering around Cozumel for the rest of the day.  We had a pretty good time, I mean we weren't mugged or anything.. but all in all I was fairly underwhelmed by Cozumel.  We ended up doing a LOT of walking and were quite tired by the end of it all (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 053.jpg\">053</a>)..  It was a long day..\n\n__In port -- Pictures of the coast__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 054.jpg\">054</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 055.jpg\">055</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 056.jpg\">056</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 057.jpg\">057</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 058.jpg\">058</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 063.jpg\">063</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 064.jpg\">064</a>\nAfter our day of swimming, and walking we were pretty tired.. Melissa took a nap and I wandered around the top of the ship taking pictures as the ship pushed off from the pier.  This picture better shows how much smaller the Carnival ships are compared to the Royal Carribbean ships. (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 058.jpg\">058</a>) I'm not even at the highest point on the ship and you can see I'm above the top of the other ship.\n\n__Under way -- Please don't feed the humans__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 059.jpg\">059</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 060.jpg\">060</a>\nOne thing the I thought was very neat was that you could go and watch the captain and crew pilot the ship.  There was a viewing area above and behind them where you could watch.. and that was awesome.. I took a picture of it and was shocked that it sorta came out. (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 059.jpg\">059</a>) You can't see all the cool stuff on the screens but.. so be it..  Oh and I found it funny as hell that they had signs posted all over to \"Please do not knock on glass.\" (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 060.jpg\">060</a>)\n\n<a class='pull-right fancybox' rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise%20062.jpg\"><img title=\"cruise-062\" src=\"/images/2009/04/cruise-062-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Some God Rays\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>\n\n__Under way -- Everyone!! Off the island!__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 061.jpg\">061</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 062.jpg\">062</a>\nI found it interesting that each port we visited had all the ships coming and going at the same time..  This seemed odd to me as one would think it would put a strain on everyone involved.. but.. *shrug* that's how they did it..\n\n__Under way -- A dog in our room?!__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 065.jpg\">065</a>\nAfter dinner on the third day we arrived back in our cabin (they called it a suite!) to find a dog on the bed!!!  This is one of those cute things they do for everyone each night.  I'm pretty sure they would have done it on the previous nights but we had the \"do not disturb\" sign on the door.\n\n###Day Four -- Grand Cayman\nSo I'm going to be a bit biased here.. Grand Cayman was by far my favorite stop..  But it's TINY!  Grand Cayman was basically a dot on the map.. The whole of Grand Cayman is an island that spans a colossal 76 square miles (Austin, Texas occupies 272 square miles) and it had more to do and more things to see than any of the other stops.   There were so many excursions it was hard to choose just one.  And it was such a beautiful place I could see myself living there.. (That's saying something for me.. )\n\n__Under way -- On our way to tender__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 066.jpg\">066</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 067.jpg\">067</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 068.jpg\">068</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 069.jpg\">069</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 070.jpg\">070</a>\nGrand Cayman is so small they don't have piers or docks for ships as large as the one we were on.  (or smaller ones)  Instead you have to get on board a smaller boat called a tender (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 068.jpg\">068</a>) that brings you into shore. (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 069.jpg\">069</a>)  And man do they ever crowd folks on these boats.. (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 070.jpg\">070</a>)   This aint the US where those pesky safety regulations get in the way. hehe  I didn't feel unsafe though.\n\n__Tendered -- Shopping! .. er.. okay maybe not__ :: *[No pictures of my shame]*\nInstead, what I felt like was a complete ass..  When you get on board the ship they issue everyone a card they call the \"Sea Pass\" with which you do everything.   It becomes your passport proxy as well as your credit card.  This one card allows you to do everything..  But of course it only works aboard ship.   I had gotten so used to just whipping out my sea pass that I completely forgot to bring my wallet to shore..   This meant we couldn't purchase anything while in Grand Cayman..\n\nI felt very very bad.  I was generally pissy for a couple hours because I know there were things Melissa wanted and that I couldn't provide for her because my dumb ass had forgotten the money..  I'm not sure how to convey to you the frustration I felt at myself over this..  I was very apologetic to Melissa and she said she understood, but I could tell she was disappointed.\n\nI promised to bring her back to Grand Cayman one day so she could do the shopping she wanted to do =)   Hell there was things I wanted too!\n\n__Excursion -- Dolphins ... and Birds?!__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 071.jpg\">071</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 072.jpg\">072</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 073.jpg\">073</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 084.jpg\">084</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 085.jpg\">085</a>\nAs I had stated above, there were a lot of excursions to choose from and due to time and the nature of these cruises we really could only do one per stop.  Melissa and I decided to do a \"Swim with the dolphins\" adventure type thing without Calvin and Karen.  They went on their own fun (and proceeded to get horribly sunburned..)  We got on a bus and were taken across the island to the dolphin facility.  The parking area was on the opposite side of a foresty area that we had to walk through and it was chalk full of exotic birds..  They were very friendly birds and would happily let us take pictures..\n\n<a class='pull-right fancybox' rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise%20077.jpg\"><img title=\"cruise-077\" src=\"/images/2009/04/cruise-077-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"A very nice day.. \" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>\n\n__Excursion -- The facility__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 074.jpg\">074</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 075.jpg\">075</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 076.jpg\">076</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 077.jpg\">077</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 078.jpg\">078</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 079.jpg\">079</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 080.jpg\">080</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 081.jpg\">081</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 082.jpg\">082</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 083.jpg\">083</a>\nThe facility itself was a very nice and new building with it's own little cove that housed 4 or 5 dolphins over looking the ocean.  The weather was nice, it was 75 or so.. which meant Melissa was cold (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 076.jpg\">076</a>).. (And hates it when I take pictures of her..)  But I mean seriously, this place was gorgeous (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 077.jpg\">077</a>) who wouldn't want to live someplace that looks like this?! (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 078.jpg\">078</a>) The scenery is just fantastic =) (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 081.jpg\">081</a>)\n\n__Excursion -- The dolphins__ :: *[No pictures available]*\nI don't have any pictures of us in the water or with the dolphins.  They refused to let me take those photos, or to take the under water camera in the water with the dolphins.  Their excuse was they didn't want us to hurt the animals, but I know the real reason was they wanted to sell us their pictures of us instead..  And of course since I was still suffering my shame from above, we couldn't purchase any..  So.. you'll have to trust me here.. there were lots of dolphins and it was fun.  I only wished there weren't as many people..  I kind of felt a tad rushed due to the size of the group.. but what can you do.. it was a good experience.\n\n<a href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise%20089.jpg\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"cruise-089\" src=\"/images/2009/04/cruise-089-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Friendly critter.. \" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>\n\n__Excursion -- Oh dear god, please don't hurt me__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 086.jpg\">086</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 087.jpg\">087</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 088.jpg\">088</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 089.jpg\">089</a>\nOn the way back to the bus after the excursion I wandered through the exotic bird area and and made a new friend! (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 086.jpg\">086</a>)  This bird was extremely friendly.. (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 087.jpg\">087</a>) Maybe too friendly.. (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 088.jpg\">088</a>)  That bird tongued me!  (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 089.jpg\">089</a>)  And sat on my shoulder nibbling my ear.. I say nibbling, I mean licking.. if that bird had \"nibbled\" she would have ripped my ear right off.. that beak was sharp as hell..\n\n__Tendered -- Tired__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 090.jpg\">090</a>\nYet again after a long day ashore and playing with the animals, we were pretty zonked.. It's odd to me that you can get as tired as we got each time considering how long these excursions were.. I mean we probably spent 5 or 6 hours doing each one and usually that was enough to do us in..  Naps for everyone!\n\n<a class='pull-right fancybox' rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise%20091.jpg\"><img title=\"cruise-091\" src=\"/images/2009/04/cruise-091-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Wow... \" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>\n\n__Tendered -- Sunsets .. again__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 091.jpg\">091</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 093.jpg\">093</a>\nDid I mention how pretty it was there?  Even the sun looked better.. Compare these sunsets to those in Cozumel.. Yeah these win..\n\n__Tendered -- Money!__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 096.jpg\">096</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 094.jpg\">094</a>\nThere is a lot of money in the Cayman Islands.  You can tell by the property and houses people have, the cars they drive, the boats they own and the fact that every 30 feet is a bank. And I mean a big bank.  There were quite a few hovels too but most of the island had nice stuff on it.  This one yacht was roughly half a mile away (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 096.jpg\">096</a>) and looked nice (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 094.jpg\">94</a>) (Though the picture is terrible.. digital zoom sucks.)  It was just the right size to be someones personal home at sea..  Oh to dream..\n\n__Under way -- Leaving Cayman__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 095.jpg\">095</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 097.jpg\">097</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 101.jpg\">101</a>\nAs the sun went down everyone gathered back on board and we prepared to leave..  We returned to the room after a nice tiring day to find a stingray on the bed.. (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 101.jpg\">101</a>) We did the dinner thing with our friends, and then rounded out the night with a nice long sleep..\n\n<a class='pull-right fancybox' rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise%20114.jpg\"><img title=\"cruise-114\" src=\"/images/2009/04/cruise-114-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Jamaica\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>\n\n###Day Five -- Jamaica\nOn day five we woke up to find ourselves already in port.  They hadn't cast down the moring lines yet, but we were basically completely parked.  I didn't care for Jamaica as much as I did Grand Cayman, though it was better than Cozumel.\n\n__In port -- Ya man!__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 102.jpg\">102</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 103.jpg\">103</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 104.jpg\">104</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 105.jpg\">105</a>\nIt was a beautiful day in Jamaica and the view from our balcony was a very nice one.\n\n__In Port -- To the excursion!__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 106.jpg\">106</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 107.jpg\">107</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 108.jpg\">108</a>\nJamaica was really very nice.. The weather was beautiful and there were boats everywhere..  We made our way to the back of our ship (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 108.jpg\">108</a>) and boarded our excursion boat.\n\n__Excursion -- Cruise and Snorkel fun__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 109.jpg\">109</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 111.jpg\">111</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 112.jpg\">112</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 134.jpg\">134</a>\nJamaica was nice and the people were friendly, but I was fairly unimpressed by the excursion selection.  It seemed all the excursions were some form of \"let us take you to this shopping area\".. We chose a cruise and snorkel type excursion with intent to enjoy the cruise, and get wet in which we didn't feel pressured to buy anything. They did have a para-sailing thing that I thought would be fun as hell but Melissa vetoed that cause she has an issue with heights.. Drat..\n\n__Excursion -- Beach__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 113.jpg\">113</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 115.jpg\">115</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 116.jpg\">116</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 117.jpg\">117</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Excursion 029.jpg\">E29</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Excursion 030.jpg\">E30</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Excursion 031.jpg\">E31</a>\nWe cruised across the bay to a beach area and unloaded half the passengers.  Some folks just wanted to go hang out at the beach, and I have to admit I'm sorry we didn't.  I think at this point we were a bit \"fun\"'d out and a nice relax on the beach would have gone over well..  Live and learn.  It was a very pretty beach with nice scenery (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 116.jpg\">116</a>) and ample to drink (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 117.jpg\">117</a>)..\n\n__Excursion -- Cruise and Sandals Resort &amp; Overcast__\nWe cruised around for a bit and the water started to get quite choppy.. I think I turned a shade of green.. We went past the Sandals beach resort blaring our music.. The Sandals beach resort didn't look that nice to be honest.. I mean it sorta looked like the beach photos above but not as pretty..  I think much of that had to do with the fact that some clouds had moved in and everything had a grey over cast look to it.. We tooled around for almost an hour..\n\n<a class='pull-right fancybox' rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Excursion%20033.jpg\"><img title=\"excursion-033\" src=\"/images/2009/04/excursion-033-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Wardrobe Malfunction\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>\n\n__Excursion -- In the water!__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Excursion 032.jpg\">E32</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Excursion 033.jpg\"> E33</a>\n*Again, crappy underwater camera..

Now prior to this I thought the equipment in Mexico was bad.. Wow.. the stuff they gave us to use was complete crap.  Everything was on it's last leg.  And we didn't get to swim for very long.  I wasn't very happy with this excursion and was glad when it was over.\n\n__Excursion -- Margaritaville__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 123.jpg\">123</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 124.jpg\">124</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 125.jpg\">125</a>\nEventually they headed back towards the ship (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 123.jpg\">123</a>) and we stopped at Margaritaville (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 124.jpg\">124</a>), and yes there is a Burger King right next door (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 125.jpg\">125</a>).. This was nice actually we found a table and sat down to enjoy the music and atmosphere while drinking possibly one of the biggest and strongest margarita's I've ever had.. It was yummy.. (we got to keep the glasses too..)\n\n<a class='pull-right fancybox' rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise%20129.jpg\"><img title=\"cruise-129\" src=\"/images/2009/04/cruise-129-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Local Jamaican band\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>\n\n__Excursion -- Local Singers__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 126.jpg\">126</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 127.jpg\">127</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 128.jpg\">128</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 129.jpg\">129</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 130.jpg\">130</a>\nA small group of singers walked up passed out some home made maraca's so we could join in the fun! Melissa took too it like a pro.. (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 126.jpg\">126</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 128.jpg\">128</a>)  These guys were great.. And it was a lot of fun watching and hearing them play.  And apparently Melissa likes me (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 130.jpg\">130</a>), there's no accounting for taste.. =p\n\n__Excursion -- View from the 'ville__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 131.jpg\">131</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 132.jpg\">132</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 133.jpg\">133</a>\nThe view from Margaritaville was nice, and you can see we aren't that far from our ship.  You could watch others having fun on their excursions (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 134.jpg\">134</a>) too.  From here you could see all the para-sailing people, and there were quite a fiew, as well as the jet ski's which I some how managed to not get a photo of..\n\n__Excursion -- The return__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 135.jpg\">135</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 136.jpg\">136</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 137.jpg\">137</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 138.jpg\">138</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 139.jpg\">139</a>\nEventually it was time to head back to the ship as both of us were tired.. Several hours of sun, surf and drinking will take it out of you..  I turned and snapped one last shot of Margaritaville as we pulled away (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 136.jpg\">136</a>).  The scenery was nice though and the water was very blue (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 138.jpg\">138</a>) the captain and crew of this little boat were a laugh riot and helped make the trip all that much more fun.. I tried to take pictures of them but none of them turned out.. =/\n\n__Excursion -- Sideways!__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 140.jpg\">140</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 141.jpg\">141</a>\n*Turn monitor sidways --- or head if you're lazy!*\nWe had fun though.. Melissa was tired so I took a snap of her and then she figured out what I was doing.. Doh.. hehe She's so cute..\n\n__In port -- Back aboard__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 142.jpg\">142</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 143.jpg\">143</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 149.jpg\">149</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 150.jpg\">150</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 152.jpg\">152</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 153.jpg\">153</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 154.jpg\">154</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 156.jpg\">156</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 157.jpg\">157</a>\nAs the day wound down I wandered around the top of the ship taking pictures of whatever suited my fancy.. There were any number of nice sail boats all over the place.. I mean seriously, its like everyone had one.. (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 154.jpg\">154</a>)\n\n<a class='pull-right fancybox' rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise%20146.jpg\"><img title=\"cruise-146\" src=\"/images/2009/04/cruise-146-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Sunset, Jamaica style!\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>\n\n__In port -- Sunset!!__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 146.jpg\">146</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 148.jpg\">148</a>\nI don't have a good sunset picture from Jamaica.. The mountains blocked the sun setting over the sea and really the clouds moved in to make it kind of dull.. These were the best I could do.. Still I think these are pretty darn nice.  It really was a beautiful place, but I still think Grand Cayman was better.\n\n###Day Six/Seven -- On the way home\nAnd so back under way we go.. On our way home back through the gulf heading North towards Houston.  Joy.\n\n__Under way -- The open ocean__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 163.jpg\">163</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 164.jpg\">164</a> <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 165.jpg\">165</a>\nThe weather up to this point was gorgeous and to be honest it never got bad.  But it did get overcast and cloudy the last couple days on our way back to Houston.  Almost like the Gulf was pouting that we were going home.. heh\n\n__Under way -- Monkey!__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 166.jpg\">166</a>\n...a Monkey (and some towel animal.. )\n\n__Under way -- Last formal dinner__ :: <a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 167.jpg\">167</a>\nProbably going to be in trouble for that last comment, so.. Whoa.. Hot chick.. (<a class=\"label fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise 167.jpg\">167</a>)  One would think I beat my wife... Some how on this trip she got all bruised up.. You can't really see it but on her leg was this nasty purple bruise that ran from her ankle half way up her calf..  She got it in Jamaica and it took almost a week to go away..\n\n__The best waitress ever -- Renata Tadic__ :: [Pictures coming]\nI'd like to take a moment to tell you about our dinners and specifically our waitress.   Each night of the cruise we would gather in one of the 3 huge dining areas in order to sit down for supper.\n\nWe had 5 couples at our table the first night.  One couple decided they didn't want to be friendly and left before Melissa and I arrived.  Which left; Melissa and I, my friends Calvin and Karen, Sam Grien and his wife Rosemary, and their friend Dave {who's last name I'm not sure I ever got} and his girlfriend Susan.  We were easily the loudest and most obnoxious table on the whole boat.. Good times!\n\nEach night Renata Tadic, a 27ish year old woman from somewhere in Croatia, would greet us with a smile on her face that was completely genuine..  She would recommend food and was generally playful with us..  She was an absolute delightful woman and an excellent waitress..  The thing that I liked the most was that she was friendly and genuine.. Many of the employees on the boat were nice, and pleasant without being genuine.. You could tell that this was a job for them and they couldn't give a crap about you, where as with Renata you actually felt important.  You could really tell that this person enjoyed what they did and took pride in doing a good job..   In my mind it was a sign of a good waitress and a good person.  (By the end of the cruise Sam was trying to interest her in his son... hehe)\n\nWhen we got loud and obnoxious, she joined right in!  If you wanted something, she got it!  Even if it was something that was difficult for one reason or another..   Most importantly, she did an excellent job rounding off each day and making sure we left the table happy.\n\nThe food was always very good, but the service was what made the experience fantastic and did more to endear me to the cruise lines as a whole.   It's interesting how one person could have such a dramatic influence over an experience.  Renata made the trip so much more enjoyable than it would have been had we had some waiter who didn't care.\n\nThank you, Renata.\n\n###The End\n\nAnd that's really it for pictures.. There are a couple more on Melissas camera that I need to get to as well as getting some from Calvin and Karen but I'm out.  At this point the cruise was really over as all we did from here was to cruise back to port in Houston over the course of the next couple days and go home..\n\nSome have commented that there aren't very many pictures of me.. and that's true.. The primary reason being, I was the one with the camera.  Now Melissa had a nice camera too (nicer than mine actually) but she didn't take too many photos with it.. *shrug*\n\nI have to be honest, at this point in the cruise, I was kind of done.  We had a great time, but 7 days onboard ship in this tiny cabin, no matter how much other stuff there is to do, is a bit excessive.   I would very much do it again though, and certainly recommend others to do it.. It was totally worth it..\n","collection":"posts","url":"/2009cruise/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2009-04-06-2009-penny-redesign.md","collection":"posts","url":"/2009-penny-redesign/","path":"_posts/2009-04-06-2009-penny-redesign.md","id":"/2009-penny-redesign","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"2009 Penny Redesign","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2009/04/2009pennyuncobvthumb.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-04-06 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"2009-penny-redesign","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2009-04-03-2009cruise.md","excerpt":"So I have been asked repeatedly when am I going to get these photos posted..

The log cabin and the rail-splitter designs are nice and seem appropriate to me.  The last two are also nice designs but I question how those images were more relevant to Lincolns life than say; the Emancipation Proclamation, or the Lincoln-Doublas Debates on the topic of Slavery. or something related to the Gettysburg Address maybe? etc..\n\nI'm just not sure that a picture of the Capitol cluttered by scaffolding was a good salute to Lincoln's life.\n\nBut most importantly;  Dear god, WHY?! ... why do this?  Amid all the government bailouts, corporate bankruptcies, and an economic down turn to rival that of the great depression, how much money did the government blow to redesign those coins?\n\nNo one forges the penny so why redesign it?  Did the old designs some how fail?  Not only that but these 4 new designs during 2009 are mandated to be further redesigned again in 2010 to a permanent design.\n\nIs this some effort to instill value in an almost valueless coin? I'm sure all the numismatists will appreciate it.. Or maybe it's bizarro feel good tactic by the government to cheer us up?  I dunno..  But the amount of money that was bound to be put into this redesign process seems silly.  Especially in an age where the penny seems largely pointless.  Most people don't stop to pick pennies up off the ground..\n\nTo be fair; No they aren't worthless.. think how much everything would go up if you had to round up to the nearest nickel.. but still..\n\nAt one point (prior to 1982) all US pennies actually had a metal content that at market value was worth more than face value of the coin. Now however, all pennies are 97.5% zinc with only 2.5% being copper (coated over the zinc) and as such have an intrinsic value of $0.0028... So 0.28% of face value..\n\nAccording to the US Mint the costs to producing and shipping already designed one-cent (penny) coins during the fiscal year 2007 was $0.0167 per penny.[<a href=\"http://www.usmint.gov/downloads/about/annual_report/2007AnnualReport.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">ref</a>]  That doesn't count the cost of redesign..\n\n$0.0167 to produce a coin worth $0.0028, with a face value of only $0.01..    Dear god no wonder we are in debt..\n\nSo, 5 billion pennies in circulation worth $50 million dollars, cost the government $70 million to make..  For those of you who are really bad at math, thats $20 million dollars wasted..\n\nI have to think even Lincoln would be ashamed..\n","collection":"posts","url":"/2009-penny-redesign/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2009-04-06-2009-penny-redesign.md","collection":"posts","url":"/2009-penny-redesign/","path":"_posts/2009-04-06-2009-penny-redesign.md","id":"/2009-penny-redesign","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"2009 Penny Redesign","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2009/04/2009pennyuncobvthumb.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-04-06 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"2009-penny-redesign","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2009-04-13-world-of-warcraft-and-peta.md","content":"<img class=\"pull-right\" title=\"sealclub\" src=\"/images/2009/04/sealclub.jpg\" alt=\"Whack a Seal!\" width=\"178\" height=\"159\" />\n\nSo, on Saturday the 11th of April, PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) held an awareness gathering in World of Warcraft where they killed four quest NPC's as a form of protest for the unethical killing of seals in real life.  Some how it got into their heads that by focusing on protecting the digital seals in a game and instead performing the far more ethical act of killing the would-be digital seal killers, it would bring awareness to the unethical killing of real world seals.\n\nSo.. let me sum up for those who can't put this together -- what they are saying is..   Kill the people who are killing the seals.\n\nAre you fucking kidding me?!  How is that more ethical?  They honestly are saying that it's more ethical to kill humans than it is to kill seals?  That's their stance?  Really?\n\nI've always heard PETA was a bunch of psycho douche bags but damn.. But to their point; Apparently a lot of seals (between 100k and 400k this year depending on which website you go to..) are killed annually by the Canadian government..  Or rather, their killing is sanctioned by the Canadian government..\n\nPETA's website goes on a very graphic tirade about how awful it is and how each seal \"must look on as fellow pups are bludgeoned to death before meeting the same bloody fate.  The anguish that a mother seal feels as she watches her baby being beaten to death just a few feet away from her is horrifying and can be heard in her desperate cries...\" Wow.. Nice spin.. Complete bullshit, but a good spin all the same..\n\nIn doing research for this, I have watched a lot of videos.. And in each video I have seen it has had some lone guy run up on an individual seemingly adult seal that was alone on an ice flow and repeatedly whack the seal in the head with a hammer on a pole.. Kinda gruesome true.. But PETA paints this as mass murder where all the baby seals are gathered up and executed Auschwitz style.. That simply isn't true..\n\nFirstly, I have no idea why the Canadian government has an annual seal season.  And from what I have read, no one else knows either..   There must be a reason, and despite what PETA thinks its not because they are all evil evil communists who hate children..  Thats how PETA paints it, but again.. not true..  That's propaganda..  There must be a reason it's legal -- what is it?\n\nApparently I'm willing to look at it a bit more objectively than PETA is;  It could be just like the deer season here in the US.. I simply don't know.  All the websites I have found on the issue are one manner of propaganda or another..  Finding hard facts is near impossible at this point because of all the inflammatory crap being flung back and forth..\n\nThe simple truth of it is;  If it's legal, then it's legal. You can be offended by it, but that doesn't mean that its against the law.  You can delve all you want into the morality pool and every one of us will come up with a different opinion on the subject.. But from a legal stand point, you can't say that killing seals is illegal.  It's not illegal.\n\nI personally think the primary difference is that seals are endearing..  It's sort of the same difference between a rat and a squirrel.. Squirrels are cute, we love them!  Rats are ugly, we hate them!  When the simple fact is they are both rodents that carry diseases, only one has a fluffy tail and lives outside which people find endearing thus squirrels are thought of more positively..  Seals are cute and as such we are offended by their early demise..\n\nI'm more than willing to concede that there are baby seals being killed out there on the ice flows.. Probably more than a few.. but to say that all the seals being killed are just cute cuddly wuddly baby seals is pure propaganda plain and simple.  Most folks that look at a picture of a seal have no idea how old that seal is..  Hell they all look like babies right?  I'm not 100% sure, but I thought seals out on the ice flow alone (as in the videos I saw) are adults, no baby seal would go out that far alone..\n\nHere is one of the videos I saw of seals being <a href=\"http://news.ebru.tv/en/americas/10775\" target=\"_blank\">clubbed to death</a>, and yes -- it's pretty gruesome.   But I would say it's no more gruesome than a deer getting shot during the annual hunting seasons here in the US..  How is that different?  It's an animal being killed by a superior species..  Just like a lion that chases down and kills a gazelle for it's meat..\n\nI eat meat.. The steak, pork and chicken that I consume also was once alive.. and is now dead..  And according to PETA I'm a murderer for it?  Really?  It's been going on for a long time.. And my maxillary permanent canine teeth sort of imply it was meant to go on.. So why does PETA think that this sort of activity is so bad?\n\nThey would answer that a lion wouldn't kill for sport, or wouldn't kill for just the skin.   To which I say; Sure they would and do all the time.   Dolphins are one of the more intelligent animals on the planet and they kill for sport..\n\nFrankly, this is just propaganda by an organization that has no power.. You see,  PETA wants to bring your attention to what they call, an injustice.. Something they call unethical..\n\nAnd since PETA has the word \"Ethical\" right in their name they must be good right?  The words right there, therefore they must be the ones doing the ethical and moral thing..  So if you disagree with them, then you're unethical!!  You bastard.\n\nThe problem is, it doesn't work that way.  Ethics are a system of moral principles governing an individual or group.  Those principles are discussed and agreed upon by that group.  No one individual or group can decide what those principles are for another individual or group.  Meaning, what's ethical here.. may not apply there.  What's moral and ethical for you may not apply to me..\n\nIn this situation you have PETA trying to tell another group what's ethically right, and if you don't do what they think is right you're wrong.   PETA is trying to control you and your way of thinking..   And they think you should DIE for disagreeing.  That's right..  Remember from above, they think the people killing the seals, should be killed...\n\nFrankly, I find that PETA is nothing more than a terrorist group (or even religious cult) that is extremely vocal and is very good at crafting sensational, vivid, graphic and even horrific language and imagery in order to manipulate people.   They do it in such a way as to make you feel bad if you don't side with them, and if that doesn't work they will intimidate, harass and threaten you..\n\nThat alone to me seems unethical.\n\nThe issue here is, like so many other animals in the animal kingdom (and yes, WE are animals) we tend to think animals are good to eat.. Most PETA members are vegetarians and as such have a moral stance that killing an animal of any kind for any reason is wrong.  Oh and they'll tell ya about it too.. We have differing ethical stances when it comes to the killing of animals.\n\nI'm all for not killing critters if we can get around it.. but sometimes it's necessary.. Like for food or for other products that we deem necessary.. Where as PETA paints this picture that we are torturing animals for our food.. Or that these seals are being tortured to death for their fur.  I haven't seen that.  I have yet to see where they hook up the car battery to the seals teets just to cause pain.  Or where they derive some sick pleasure from slapping a seal around..\n\nIn every video I have seen, they kill the animal in very short order.. It may take two or three whacks but its over and done fairly quickly..  How is that torture?   Torture to me implies the repeated infliction of pain over a period of time from which you derive some sick sadistic pleasure..  Walking up to an animal and bludgeoning it to death with intent to use it for one purpose or another, isn't torture..\n\nI have seen horrific and evil video of animals being tortured.. (Just watch the PETA website..)  Yeah that shits awful.. But that stuff is illegal and there are laws in place to stop it.   The seal hunts are legal, and not in the same category despite what you think.\n\nLook, I love animals.. I do.. I always have..  And I think the torture of animals is wrong and the people doing it should go away for ever.. But it's pretty clear to me that PETA loves animals more than Humans..\n\nPETA will try to tell you that animals are todays \"slaves\" and that what happens to a cow or a chicken today is morally identical to what happened to the Jewish people in the holocaust..  And that shit is fucking offensive as hell.. And I'm not Jewish!!  To actually trivialize the holocaust like that is just unimaginable and goes a very long way to prove that anyone who belongs to PETA has no basis in reality.\n\nHrmm.. maybe they belong in a game?\n","collection":"posts","url":"/world-of-warcraft-and-peta/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2009-05-04-thorim.md","collection":"posts","url":"/thorim/","path":"_posts/2009-05-04-thorim.md","id":"/thorim","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Thorim is hard!
