  It's a good purchase and I can highly recommend it..\n\nRoger offers a really nice kit that seems to go with his book, but it costs over $500 and I just didn't think that would be a good beginners project.  So I settled on getting an inexpensive <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?um=1&amp;hl=en&amp;rlz=1C1CHFX_enUS431US431&amp;biw=1459&amp;bih=939&amp;q=Saga%20AM-10%20A-Model%20Mandolin%20Kit&amp;gs_sm=e&amp;gs_upl=9714l9714l0l10062l1l1l0l0l0l0l78l78l1l1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;tbo=u&amp;tbm=shop&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=if\" target=\"_blank\">Saga AM10 Mandolin Kit</a> to experiment on which I got off ebay for less than $90..\n\n<a href=\"/images/2011/07/mandolin0011.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Mandolin in Fixture\" src=\"/images/2011/07/mandolin0011-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Mandolin in Fixture\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Mandolin in Fixture</span></a>\n\nAs kit's go, I'd say this one is extremely rough, to the point of being bad, as very few of the parts matched up, even a little..  The instructions that came with it were meager at best, and very poor in most cases..  The strings it came with are worthless (the e string broke trying to bring it up to tension, I didn't even get it close to tuned and it popped)..  The back didn't fit the body at all, being undersized compared to the top and required a heck of a lot of work.. The neck didn't fit the main body at all, again a lot of work..etc..\n\n<a href=\"/images/2011/07/mandolin0021.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"Bottomless Mandolin\" src=\"/images/2011/07/mandolin0021-e1311459220144-150x112.jpg\" alt=\"Bottomless Mandolin\" width=\"150\" height=\"112\" /><br /><span>Bottomless Mandolin</span></a>\n\nI think a beginner woodworker would have had a very difficult time with this kit to be honest.. I have a lot of tools, experience and time with wood so it wasn't too bad for me but even so I had to make a bunch of jigs and fixtures in order to get things to line up and work correctly.   But even with my best effort just due to how it was cut my neck isn't correctly centered on the soundboard which will make stringing it interesting..   The tail piece is half an inch off center unfortunately which means the bridge is off center..etc..  I have no idea how that is going to affect the sound of the instrument but in all likelihood it won't do it justice.\n\nAll things considered though, I'm actually happy with my results so far..  It's taken me just shy of 3 weeks to get it all worked up and to the point of getting strings on it.  (Mostly working on the weekends and an hour or two in the evenings during the week when I could..\n\n<a href=\"/images/2011/07/mandolin003.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"One string Mandolin\" src=\"/images/2011/07/mandolin003-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"One string Mandolin\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>One string Mandolin</span></a>\n\nToday I added the very first string to the instrument and tuned it up just to see what it sounded like..  Shockingly it sounded like a D!  The instrument didn't have any kind of odd barks or vibrations though it does sound slightly different than the Ibanez I purchased above.\n\nI have added 4 other strings to it at this point and the difference in the sound is still there, but I simply am not articulate enough with sound and instrument theory to describe to you the difference.. it's just slightly different.. Not better, not worse.. different.\n\nEven so, I'm pretty happy so far with how things are going.\n\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2011-07-22-game-review-frozen-synapse.md","url":"/game-review-frozen-synapse/","relative_path":"_posts/2011-07-22-game-review-frozen-synapse.md","id":"/game-review-frozen-synapse","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Game Review: Frozen Synapse","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2011/07/frozensynapse.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2011-07-22 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"game-review-frozen-synapse","ext":".md"},"url":"/mandolin-luthiery/","relative_path":"_posts/2011-07-23-mandolin-luthiery.md","id":"/mandolin-luthiery","collection":"posts","excerpt":"I decided to try my hand at becoming a hobby luthier (a maker of stringed instruments) and make myself something to play..    I went back and forth considering all the options and decided that for my first instrument I'd like to make a Mandolin.  ","draft":false,"categories":["Hobbies"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Mandolin Luthiery -- Making and playing the Mandolin","layout":"post","tags":["Luthiery","Mandolin","Wood Working"],"image":"/images/2011/07/mandolin101.jpg","ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x2","private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2011-07-23 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"mandolin-luthiery","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2011-07-22-game-review-frozen-synapse.md","output":null,"content":"<a href=\"/images/2011/07/frozensynapse.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Frozen Synapse\" src=\"/images/2011/07/frozensynapse-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Frozen Synapse\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Frozen Synapse</span></a>\n\nI have always been a huge fan of the turn based tactical isometric games such as Jagged Alliance, JA2, Xcom..etc..  For whatever reason that style of meticulous gameplay always appealed to me, but I had always assumed I was alone in my passion because those games never seemed to last very long in favor of first person shooters or real time strategy games..etc..\n\nIn fact, the industry as a whole has completely moved away from turn based game play, which I find to be a shame. Well thank god there are awesome independent developers around to fill the void!\n\nFrozen Synapse is just the turn based top down tactical game that I have been craving for years.  It has a wonderfully fun and even somewhat dark sense of humor and most importantly, awesome gameplay.\n\nThere is nothing better than a game with deceptively simple gameplay that provides hours and hours of fun because it's extremely challenging to master..\n\nPlus it's multiplayer!!  How awesome is that?!\n\nI can't tell you the number of times I said that XCom needed to be multiplayer so that I could play against my friends.. And sure as heck they did it here..\n\nThe interface is a little confusing at first, as it takes some time to understand what all the different commands do..  Plus as a whole the interface is kinda weak, but other than that I think this is an excellent game.\n\nI wish I could give each character more than the one weapon, but I understand why they did things the way they did and so I wont ding them on that.. All in all I think it's a very good game guys.. well done.\n\n4.5 out of 5 losing that half for some interface suckery..   Still, if you know me.. 4.5 is an awesome score.\n","previous":{"next":{"path":"_posts/2011-07-22-game-review-frozen-synapse.md","url":"/game-review-frozen-synapse/","relative_path":"_posts/2011-07-22-game-review-frozen-synapse.md","id":"/game-review-frozen-synapse","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Game Review: Frozen Synapse","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2011/07/frozensynapse.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2011-07-22 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"game-review-frozen-synapse","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2011-07-15-game-review-red-faction-armageddon.md","output":null,"content":"<a href=\"/images/2011/07/red-faction-armageddon-review.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Red Faction: Armageddon\" src=\"/images/2011/07/red-faction-armageddon-review-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Red Faction: Armageddon\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Red Faction: Armageddon</span></a>\n\nI played Red Faction back in 2001 when it first came out and enjoyed the heck out of it.   It was the very first game to come out with the Geo-Mod game engine which allowed for massive destruction of the game models and levels.   The game itself was otherwise unremarkable, but the fact that you could destroy everything made it awesome.\n\nI find it funny that one little thing like that can make or break a game entirely, and the massively destructable nature of the Red Faction games entirely \"makes\" these titles.\n\nRed Faction II was one of those games that came out only a year or so later but it managed to skip my notice and the series sorta fell off my radar.\n\nThe other day I picked up the latest in the franchise; Red Faction: Armageddon.   And I'm glad to say that it's up to the original games standards in all ways .. to include the shortcomings..\n\nLet me start by saying that by all standards it's a good game all things considered, and I did enjoy it.  But there are some cons:\n\nThis game is of course plagued by one of my common complaints with all games these days;  The game is too short.. by a long shot..  That's typical of all games though so I think the industry as a whole is trying to bring our game length expectations down fraction by fraction until we get a 3 hour tour for the same $60.  Oh well..

However, I'm of the opinion that making a game like this too easy even when set on \"hard\" in order to keep the game \"fun\" is akin to handing the little league losers a trophy for participation..   Reward me for doing well, not for just showing up.  If I set the game to \"hard\" I believe it's reasonable to expect the game to actually be difficult.\n\nAnd finally my major complaint about the game is the weapons they give you.    Within the first minute or two of gameplay they give you the ONLY WEAPON YOU WILL EVER NEED; the gravity gun.   Now, I don't want to complain about the gravity gun.. there is nothing more fun that hurling a whole building of destructive debris at an enemy.. and you generally have a reasonable expectation of doing fairly well when you use the same gun to hurl an enemy at a far wall only to watch him <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gib_(video_gaming)\" target=\"_blank\">gib</a>.     But, why do I need the other guns?\n\nThey give you a whole slew of other wizbang cool guns and more ammo than you can shake a stick at just lying around but I can honestly say I didn't even start using ANY of them until near the very end of the game.  Up to that point I just used the gravity gun to do everything..   Either tossing the mobs around or throwing entire structures at them..  The other guns seemed pointless mostly.. and the ludicrous amounts of ammo lying around, doubly so.\n\nThis game is also extremely linear, so much so if you get out of the \"area\" you're supposed to be in a countdown to your doom will appear.. better boogy back to where you're supposed to be pronto..  I don't really want to hold this up as a complaint though, this isn't a sandbox game and like the original was never meant to be..   Still I can see how some might be put off by the count down thing..\n\nAll in all though I enjoyed the game.   There is still something very appealing about being about appease your darker side by waging wanton destruction on the carefully designed levels..  And if you're not giddily giggling like a school girl over being about to toss mobs around like rag dolls to their ultimate doom, then you don't know how to have a good time..  it was fun.  Though it's replayability is pretty much zero.\n\nI give this game 3.5 out of 5. (That's a good score from me.)\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2011-06-20-hostgator-really-sucks.md","url":"/hostgator-really-sucks/","relative_path":"_posts/2011-06-20-hostgator-really-sucks.md","id":"/hostgator-really-sucks","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Hostgator Really Sucks...","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2011/06/hostgator_sucks.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2011-06-20 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"hostgator-really-sucks","ext":".md"},"url":"/game-review-red-faction-armageddon/","relative_path":"_posts/2011-07-15-game-review-red-faction-armageddon.md","id":"/game-review-red-faction-armageddon","collection":"posts","excerpt":"I played Red Faction back in 2001 when it first came out and enjoyed the heck out of it.   It was the very first game to come out with the Geo-Mod game engine which allowed for massive destruction of the game models and levels.  ","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Game Review: Red Faction - Armageddon","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2011/07/red-faction-armageddon-review.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2011-07-15 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"game-review-red-faction-armageddon","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2011-06-20-hostgator-really-sucks.md","output":null,"content":"<img class=\"pull-right\" title=\"Hostgator Sucks\" src=\"/images/2011/06/hostgator_sucks.jpg\" alt=\"Hostgator Sucks\" width=\"198\" height=\"306\" />\n\nI have moved my hosting off Hostgator because frankly, they suck.   My site was suffering repeated down times, crashes, database disconnects, SSH daemon crashes/hangups, ..etc..\n\nThe big pisser for me though was the SSH restricted access that they had given me, combined with the more recent downtime..\n\nFor whatever reason I'd try to SSH into my account and it would fail acting as if there was no SSH daemon running..  I'd have to contact them via their live chat system, wait in queue forever for some support monkey to help me, only to have them either tell me that;  A) nothings wrong.  B) I don't have an account with them or best of all C) \"Oh yeah we changed the SSH port to ### now.. use that.. \"\n\nSeriously?  You just up and changed the SSH port?  Why?!  It's been 22 for ever..

I started on the basic shape of the vehicle and had hoped to get a lot farther along than I did.\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2011/05/SU152-hour2.jpg\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"SU 152 -- Hour 2\" src=\"/images/2011/05/SU152-hour2-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"SU 152 -- Hour 2\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>SU 152 -- Hour 2</span></a>\n\n__Hour 2 -- Refine basic shape__\n\nThe second hour I spent getting the main body to match up with the backdrops and to get all the curvy bits to curve, and the straight bits to be straight.   The body you see is still synchronous along the x axis, but wont be for long.  Again I had hoped and planned to get more done in the second hour.\n\nThese hours are going by fast!  I wrote out a plan of what I thought I could get done in each hour and I'm failing to make the mark.\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2011/05/SU152-hour3.jpg\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"SU 152 -- Hour 3\" src=\"/images/2011/05/SU152-hour3-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"SU 152 -- Hour 3\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>SU 152 -- Hour 3</span></a>\n\n__Hour 3 -- Rear end work and beginnings of road wheel__\n\nWhile I added a lot of rear end basic shape, the majority of the work in this hour was on the beginnings of that roadwheel.\n\nThe reason I spent so much time on it is because its a 100% subpatch, where as the main body of the tank isn't at all.   This means the road wheel once done, is done.  Wont need to revisit it to get the detail out of it.  Even so again this hour flew by.\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2011/05/SU152-hour4.jpg\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"SU 152 -- Hour 4\" src=\"/images/2011/05/SU152-hour4-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"SU 152 -- Hour 4\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>SU 152 -- Hour 4</span></a>\n\n__Hour 4 -- Making the body 100% subdividable__\n\nOkay so the subdivision thing had to be resolved as it's unacceptable to me to model up something that can't be subdivided.  So with that, this hour was spent converting the entire tank body to sub-d.   This pretty much ends the synchronous body work as the details I start to add are all going to be off center one way or another.\n\nThis was an ugly sub-d conversion as I really was pressed for time, but it works and renders out nicely as you can see.\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2011/05/SU152-hour5.jpg\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"SU 152 -- Hour 5\" src=\"/images/2011/05/SU152-hour5-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"SU 152 -- Hour 5\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>SU 152 -- Hour 5</span></a>\n\n__Hour 5 -- More Roadwheel work__\n\nI spent this hour working on the road wheels.  The tracks are going to take the longest amount of time for sure, but I had hoped to have all of the road wheels done by this hour.  I had hour six set aside as the hour in which I would make the single track, and then in hour seven I'd get it correctly arrayed around the road wheels.\n\nWell at this point I don't have all the road wheels done.  I still have the six main road wheels, their spring assemblies, and the three return wheels to do.. =(\n\nIt's becoming increasingly evident that 10 hours will not be enough time at my skill level to get this thing done.   I'll likely release the 10hour model, then continue on with it and release more as I get more done.\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2011/05/SU152-hour6.jpg\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"SU 152 -- Hour 6\" src=\"/images/2011/05/SU152-hour6-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"SU 152 -- Hour 6\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>SU 152 -- Hour 6</span></a>\n\n__Hour 6 -- Even More Road Wheels!__\n\nI spent this hour adding the six primary road wheels to the model.  Thankfully, its the same road wheel cloned a bunch of times so not a lot of extra work was needed.. I just had to create one wheel.    Even so it took a long time to get it looking the way my plans show.. its actually a very detailed wheel..\n\nI still need to model up the linkages that go between the backs of the wheels and the hull, create the three return wheels and if I have time, add some of the details that are missing.\n\nOnce that's done.. Track!\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2011/05/SU152-hour7.jpg\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"SU 152 -- Hour 7\" src=\"/images/2011/05/SU152-hour7-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"SU 152 -- Hour 7\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>SU 152 -- Hour 7</span></a>\n\n__Hour 7 -- Road Wheel details and return wheels etc..__\n\nThis hour (which in all honesty was closer to an hour and a half) was spent getting all the road wheel details in place.. The wheel pistons, spring assemblies, and return wheels are all in now.\n\nAgain thankfully I only had to do each one time, then clone them over and over.   I also skimped a little on some of the details just due to time.  Like for example, none of the wheels are actually connected to anything.. They just kinda float there.. I'll get to that eventually, but so long as it doesn't show up in a render...\n\nIn hour 8 I hope to get the track done, leaving hour 9 and 10 for the body details and gun.\n\nNo way in hell I'm making it in 10 hours..\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2011/05/SU152-hour8-crash.jpg\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Modo CTD\" src=\"/images/2011/05/SU152-hour8-crash-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Modo CTD\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Modo CTD</span></a>\n\n__Hour 8 -- Crash To Desktop__\n\nI love Modo.  I really think its easily one of the best modeling packages out there, but its instability pisses me off..\n\nThe application just randomly crashes to desktop sometimes for no apparent reason.   In 301 I used to avoid certain tools cause they just about always caused a CTD, but in 401 its mind bogglingly random.  You can use the same tool a 100 times on the exact same model, and on the 101'st time it will crash.\n\nI end up saving my models quite often for fear that this will happen, cause I know it will.. I hate it..\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2011/05/SU152-hour8.jpg\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"SU 152 -- Hour 8\" src=\"/images/2011/05/SU152-hour8-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"SU 152 -- Hour 8\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>SU 152 -- Hour 8</span></a>\n\n__Hour 8 -- The real thing.. __\n\nOkay so after storming away from the computer in a fit of pique I came back and got back to working on what I was doing.  I was working on the roof doors and spring hatch assemblies.\n\nNot much for an hours worth of work I know.. The crash really took it out of me..\n\nHour 9 will be my finishing off the roof and rear nurnies/greebles and then save hour 10 for the main gun.\n\nI have accepted that there is no way I'm going to get the track on the tank within the 10 hours, so that will have to come at a later time. *sigh* sorry.\n\nEither way, at hour 10 I'll release a link to this model.\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2011/05/SU152-hour9.jpg\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"SU 152 -- Hour 9\" src=\"/images/2011/05/SU152-hour9-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"SU 152 -- Hour 9\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>SU 152 -- Hour 9</span></a>\n\n__Hour 9 -- Roof Nurnies and Greebles__\n\nI went as fast as I could to get all the little roof details in and it still took me an age.   Most likely, for a 10 hour project I am employing way too much detail.. I just don't know how else to do it..  The more I think about it the more I think that making extremely low poly models (for games and the like) is an art form that I'm not sure I'll ever master.  (Modo says I'm up to 2.6 million polygons.. The WOT game version probably has only a couple hundred.. )\n\nThe rear end of the vehicles is still entirely unfinished and that sucks.  I'll get to it, I wont let this one go unfinished as I am enjoying it but it wont happen in the 10 hours\n\nI will be using hour 10 to work on the gun.\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2011/05/SU152-hour10.jpg\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"SU 152 -- Hour 10\" src=\"/images/2011/05/SU152-hour10-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"SU 152 -- Hour 10\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>SU 152 -- Hour 10</span></a>\n\n__Hour 10 -- Gun!__\n\nWell I got as much done as I could in the short period of time that I had left for the main gun.. A lot is missing, and I'll have to get to it as I can.\n\nAll in all this has been a very good experience.. 10 hours is no where near enough time to do anything remotely close to a fully finished project.\n\nPlus, with the 2 CTD's that happened, setup, odd breaks and overages.. this 10 hours was likely more like 13 and that just wasn't enough..\n\nMy plan is to continue updating this guy and post the results here.\n\nBut as I promised above -- Here's the model -- SU152 at 10 hours in Modo format:   __<a href=\"/images/2011/05/SU152.zip\">SU152.zip</a>__\n\nI would ask that you please not directly link to that file on your sites, but rather host it yourself.  If too many people start linking it I'll be forced to remove it.\n\nUsage;  You're free to use this model in anyway you see fit so long as you please give credit where credit is due by mentioning my name {Jason ''Palamedes'' Ellis} and give me a link back to this page so that others can use the model too.\n\nAny and all comments are welcome..  Feel free to email me at;  <img class=\"alignnone\" src=\"/images/2008/06/email.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"146\" height=\"14\" />\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2011/05/SU152-hour11.jpg\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"SU 152 -- Hour 11\" src=\"/images/2011/05/SU152-hour11-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"SU 152 -- Hour 11\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>SU 152 -- Hour 11</span></a>\n\n*__And so it continues! __*\n\n__Hour 11 -- Chin!__\n\nSo I have gotten over my disappointment at not being able to finish the model in the alloted time period and continued to work on it.  During this hour I added the \"chin\" stuff that sits under the gun mantle.\n\nI wont be updating the downloadable model on the site every time I do work..
