I never published it because I was so burnt out even the thought of pushing the damn file to the server was too much.  It's a single command.   It's January of 2018 now, I'm still here and still burnt.  I'll talk more to that below.\n\nSoftware developer burnout is a real thing and it's bad.  I had always heard about it and even witnessed others go through it but I had never really experienced myself.  As such I was overly quick to dismiss it or give it lip service without really considering the true ramifications or impact of the event. \n\nI have been a software developer for over 20 years.  No kidding, a long time to be sure.  And I have some how managed to avoid burnout until last year.   I'm sure every industry has some version of developer burnout but with folks in software it's extremely bad, and it takes months if not years to come back.. if they ever do.  It's taken me months to even consider it...\n\nI may not go back.  Honestly at this point I'm looking forward to law enforcement again, but that's a different story.\n\nAnyone can burn out.  From a high end CEO, to a software developer, to a person that digs ditches every day.  Burnout seems to happen when someone does a thing over and over for long periods of time without getting any real joy out of it.  Or without having a sense of accomplishment.  This is what happened to me.\n\nAnd I didn't even realize it until it was too late!\n\nI worked for years for one company or another developing software large and small.  I liked it.  I really enjoyed being an individual contributor that went to work every day creating something that people would use.  \n\nI'll be the first to admit I stayed way too long at IBM, and that by the 6th year mark I was thoroughly done but that was a management issue.  Not the job.   I still loved the job.   (People quit managers, not jobs..  keep that in mind, to that end I still feel bad about yelling at John the way I did.. Where ever you are John, I'm still very regreful and I hope you can one day forgive me for being an idiot.)\n\nThat all kinda changed about mid way through my life at Grok. \n\nGrok Interactive is a small services company that I started with a friend from a previous company and it went really well.  (The company is still going strong, I'm just not there any more for my own sanity reasons =)\n\nI just got to the point where I really didn't enjoy any aspect of the work and I needed out.  Eventually that out came and I ran for the hills!\n\n---  Continued 8 months later!\n\nwhoa.. I forgot I had started this post.  I was actually going to bring up my blog and type this post when I saw it in my queue of stuff to publish..  yes.. yes and double yes.. all of the above is still true.  I'm still crispy about software and at this point my knowledge has almost completely perished.   I have a lot of code I could go back and look at and I'm sure I could bring myself back up to speed but it would have to be on my own terms.  I think my days of working for other software firms as a paid employee in any capacity is over.\n\nRight now I'm working as a Deputy Sheriff for a small county here in North Georgia and I'm enjoying it for the most part.  I still dream about doing stuff in the software field though.  I think of problems and dream up solutions.  I have a couple back burner thoughts that I might try to field test too.  \n\nI will be updating my blog again going forward and I'm playing with some othe software projects too again.. so maybe there's still hope.","previous":{"next":{"path":"_posts/2017-05-15-developer-burnout.md","url":"/developer-burnout/","relative_path":"_posts/2017-05-15-developer-burnout.md","id":"/developer-burnout","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Software Developer Burnout...

Time for me to talk about how I never post any more and how I have no time.  Life is super busy, I'm doing too many things, I need to find time..etc.. \n\nFeh.. These are all lies.  Mostly, I think I'm just really wanting to do something else..  I get into these weird moods where nothing is right and everything looks old/boring..etc.  Really this is just an excuse and a sign that something larger is at issue.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm still going to ponder redoing this site.. 'cause that's the kind of brain damaged I am but a lot more is going on.  \n\nA couple months ago I sold off my half of my ownership in a software company and honestly, it was past time.   In a weird way I'm still coming to terms with it, but mostly because I still don't know what I want to be when I grow up. \n\nWhen you have worked in software for over twenty years, it's hard to do something else.   A clean break seems impossible, but at the same time seems like the only way to move forward.  \n\nGrok was great and it was a good experience over all but I want to do my own thing, and I want to do other things.   I got into software professionally in the early 1990's and almost did it on a lark.  Originally programming was a hobby that was all funzies and joy..  The important lesson I learned was, once you turn a hobby into a career, you lose the hobby and it becomes work.\n\nI'm to the point now that the notion of going back into software as a professional developer (even as an individual contributor instead of management) is completely distasteful.  Sure the money is great, but the level of anxiety and sense of misery is palpable.  I just can't bring myself to do it. \n\nI still like the idea of writing my own software and doing something very passively that might make money or might not just as an \"out\" or as something fun to do in my spare time though.  Very much back to my original \"hobby\" status with programming.  But professionally?  Nope.  I think I'm done there.\n\nI've pondered doing some stuff with the airplane build that makes it more of a tutorial site where others can comment and give input on how to build a plane.  Sort of a community documentation site.  I have to ponder this.  But the idea would be to make it so that each step in the plans would be it's own page with a video or documentation on how to do the work.  Almost an interactive crowd sourced project where people can talk / discuss and even comment directly on the plans and steps in a virtual space.   I have reached out to Scott Risan at Van's Aircraft to see if this is something they would support or veto.  No response yet. \n\nI'm going to make a video to my patreons about this and see what they think.\n\n### Other things on my list of \"shit to do\";\n\n_I want to redesign the blog_ \nBut not necessarily a full visual redesign, but more of a \"bring it up to currency\" with regards to be backend deployment software.  It's been ages since I have updated my Jekyll install and I'm STILL using LESS.  That needs to be rectified.  \n\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2016-02-29-democratic-socialism.md","url":"/democratic-socialism/","relative_path":"_posts/2016-02-29-democratic-socialism.md","id":"/democratic-socialism","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Democratic Socialism","layout":"post","tags":["Democratic Socialism"],"image":"/images/2016/socialism.png","gallery":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"tile_class":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"duration":null,"costs":null,"date":"2016-02-29 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"democratic-socialism","ext":".md"},"url":"/out-of-time/","relative_path":"_posts/2016-12-01-out-of-time.md","id":"/out-of-time","collection":"posts","excerpt":"Well, it's that time again.
