Time for me to talk about how I never post any more and how I have no time.  Life is super busy, I'm doing too many things, I need to find time..etc.. \n\nFeh.. These are all lies.  Mostly, I think I'm just really wanting to do something else..  I get into these weird moods where nothing is right and everything looks old/boring..etc.  Really this is just an excuse and a sign that something larger is at issue.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm still going to ponder redoing this site.. 'cause that's the kind of brain damaged I am but a lot more is going on.  \n\nA couple months ago I sold off my half of my ownership in a software company and honestly, it was past time.   In a weird way I'm still coming to terms with it, but mostly because I still don't know what I want to be when I grow up. \n\nWhen you have worked in software for over twenty years, it's hard to do something else.   A clean break seems impossible, but at the same time seems like the only way to move forward.  \n\nGrok was great and it was a good experience over all but I want to do my own thing, and I want to do other things.   I got into software professionally in the early 1990's and almost did it on a lark.  Originally programming was a hobby that was all funzies and joy..  The important lesson I learned was, once you turn a hobby into a career, you lose the hobby and it becomes work.\n\nI'm to the point now that the notion of going back into software as a professional developer (even as an individual contributor instead of management) is completely distasteful.  Sure the money is great, but the level of anxiety and sense of misery is palpable.  I just can't bring myself to do it. \n\nI still like the idea of writing my own software and doing something very passively that might make money or might not just as an \"out\" or as something fun to do in my spare time though.  Very much back to my original \"hobby\" status with programming.  But professionally?  Nope.  I think I'm done there.\n\nI've pondered doing some stuff with the airplane build that makes it more of a tutorial site where others can comment and give input on how to build a plane.  Sort of a community documentation site.  I have to ponder this.  But the idea would be to make it so that each step in the plans would be it's own page with a video or documentation on how to do the work.  Almost an interactive crowd sourced project where people can talk / discuss and even comment directly on the plans and steps in a virtual space.   I have reached out to Scott Risan at Van's Aircraft to see if this is something they would support or veto.  No response yet. \n\nI'm going to make a video to my patreons about this and see what they think.\n\n### Other things on my list of \"shit to do\";\n\n_I want to redesign the blog_ \nBut not necessarily a full visual redesign, but more of a \"bring it up to currency\" with regards to be backend deployment software.  It's been ages since I have updated my Jekyll install and I'm STILL using LESS.  That needs to be rectified.  \n\n","collection":"posts","url":"/out-of-time/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2017-05-15-developer-burnout.md","collection":"posts","url":"/developer-burnout/","path":"_posts/2017-05-15-developer-burnout.md","id":"/developer-burnout","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Software Developer Burnout...

I never published it because I was so burnt out even the thought of pushing the damn file to the server was too much.  It's a single command.   It's January of 2018 now, I'm still here and still burnt.  I'll talk more to that below.\n\nSoftware developer burnout is a real thing and it's bad.  I had always heard about it and even witnessed others go through it but I had never really experienced myself.  As such I was overly quick to dismiss it or give it lip service without really considering the true ramifications or impact of the event. \n\nI have been a software developer for over 20 years.  No kidding, a long time to be sure.  And I have some how managed to avoid burnout until last year.   I'm sure every industry has some version of developer burnout but with folks in software it's extremely bad, and it takes months if not years to come back.. if they ever do.  It's taken me months to even consider it...\n\nI may not go back.  Honestly at this point I'm looking forward to law enforcement again, but that's a different story.\n\nAnyone can burn out.  From a high end CEO, to a software developer, to a person that digs ditches every day.  Burnout seems to happen when someone does a thing over and over for long periods of time without getting any real joy out of it.  Or without having a sense of accomplishment.  This is what happened to me.\n\nAnd I didn't even realize it until it was too late!\n\nI worked for years for one company or another developing software large and small.  I liked it.  I really enjoyed being an individual contributor that went to work every day creating something that people would use.  \n\nI'll be the first to admit I stayed way too long at IBM, and that by the 6th year mark I was thoroughly done but that was a management issue.  Not the job.   I still loved the job.   (People quit managers, not jobs..  keep that in mind, to that end I still feel bad about yelling at John the way I did.. Where ever you are John, I'm still very regreful and I hope you can one day forgive me for being an idiot.)\n\nThat all kinda changed about mid way through my life at Grok. \n\nGrok Interactive is a small services company that I started with a friend from a previous company and it went really well.  (The company is still going strong, I'm just not there any more for my own sanity reasons =)\n\nI just got to the point where I really didn't enjoy any aspect of the work and I needed out.  Eventually that out came and I ran for the hills!\n\n---  Continued 8 months later!\n\nwhoa.. I forgot I had started this post.  I was actually going to bring up my blog and type this post when I saw it in my queue of stuff to publish..  yes.. yes and double yes.. all of the above is still true.  I'm still crispy about software and at this point my knowledge has almost completely perished.   I have a lot of code I could go back and look at and I'm sure I could bring myself back up to speed but it would have to be on my own terms.  I think my days of working for other software firms as a paid employee in any capacity is over.\n\nRight now I'm working as a Deputy Sheriff for a small county here in North Georgia and I'm enjoying it for the most part.  I still dream about doing stuff in the software field though.  I think of problems and dream up solutions.  I have a couple back burner thoughts that I might try to field test too.  \n\nI will be updating my blog again going forward and I'm playing with some othe software projects too again.. so maybe there's still hope.","collection":"posts","url":"/developer-burnout/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2017-05-15-developer-burnout.md","collection":"posts","url":"/developer-burnout/","path":"_posts/2017-05-15-developer-burnout.md","id":"/developer-burnout","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Software Developer Burnout...

And in 2018, the gap between the two extremes is way larger.  The rich are massively richer, where as the wage earners are at the same place.   \n \nAs if to say we needed to do something to help those poor people who do all the work!  Of course, all the while their talking positions and language was laced with self-aggrandizing pity and self-interest for the need to give the poor (that they self identified as) free shit! (read: take money away from the greedy rich whom obviously dont deserve it.)\n\nTo which I said;  Or, you could just do what the \"rich\" have done and stop working for \"the man\" and take some risks.  Start a business!  TRY!  Put yourself out there!  How do you think the rich became rich in the first place?!  Risk takers get rich and deserve the lion share of the profits because of said risk, the wage earner will never be rich.\n\nHoly shit.. You'd think I pissed in their cereal.  All of them suddenly had the look on their face like they tasted butt.. Uh oh.. I just became public enemy number one by upsetting the proletariat and not towing the \"give me free shit\" line.\n\nI love how \"the rich\" are always defined as some nebulous group of greedy people at the top that like to keep people under their boot and horde all the money.  And I routinely get ostracized as a heretical pariah or at the least persona non grata when I suggest that, No, they are people just like you and I that actually took a risk!  \n\nStatistically I have no idea if the gap is that much greater now than it was in 1990..  But if you expect to keep doing the working day grind and suddenly get rich then you're in for a shock.  More over, there's this radical notion that people who earned money by taking the risk to get it, shouldn't be allowed to keep what they earned and some how they are being greedy for wanting to.. uh.. wut?\n\nI just don't get it.. \n\nIf you're not willing to try, if you're not willing to risk.. then you don't deserve the reward.  You don't get to bemoan your lot in life if you aren't willing to do anything to change it.   How is this even a discussion?!  \n\nThe biggest risk in life is to take no risk at all, if you're not courageous enough to try to excel then you need to accept being ordinary.\n\n","collection":"posts","url":"/i-want-to-be-rich/","output":null,"next":null,"path":"_posts/2018-04-25-i-want-to-be-rich.md","excerpt":"There's this radical notion that people who earned money by taking the risk to get it, shouldn't be allowed to keep what they earned and some how they are being greedy for wanting to.. uh.. wut?","id":"/i-want-to-be-rich","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"I want to be rich!
