<p>Okay I have completely coopted this older post in order to talk about the changes I just made.</p>

<p>I have been using Jekyll for a while for my blog instead of wordpress or some other service out there simply because I got tired of it being hacked and messed with.  Plus Jekyll + Github hosting makes perfect sense and I love it.</p>

<p>And now I have refactored the jekyll template I was using to this new one.  This is a template of my own design and it seems to work pretty well. 
My plan is to make all this stuff available for download so that others can use them too.</p>

<p>There are a couple changes I want to make already.  Specifically I want the long front page lists to be dynamically loaded as you scroll down instead of showing everything all at once.  That is in the works but I haven’t gotten it correct yet.  Dynamic loading of a static site is an interesting proposition and I have to ponder the best way to move forward.</p>

<p>Now whats interesting is that due to how this new site displays, in a tiles, I can update older posts and they are still on the front page.. like this one!</p>

<p>I have turned off comments for the time being.. Sorry for all the commenters out there.. but I’m starting to see some bloat from discord and I don’t like that.  I may just do without comments going forward.</p>

<p>I need to go through every old post and update the way I am calling images to use the real new and better markdown way.  Inline html is BAD and I shouldn’t ever have to do it.  But sometimes I do.. so that’s a thing to come.</p>

<h3 id="originally-published-post">Originally Published Post</h3>

<p><img src="/images/2018/site-redesign.jpg" alt="Site Redesign" class="right scaled" /></p>

<p>Yet another vast block of time has gone by.  Life continues apace and I continue to ignore my blog / diary.  I realize now that this blog is nothing more than a modern diary, and not really anything else.  I treat it as such anyway.</p>

<p>I really want to do so many things here though.  Back in the day I made these really cool and clever animated sites and I loved it but I got away with that and have been boring ever since.  I still want to do those things.. I liked doing all that 3D work and enjoyed making those cool sites but wow the time it took was pretty vast and now that I’m older I have so many other things I could be doing haha.</p>

<p>Having said that,  I get this creative restlessness that makes me want to do something… ANYTHING! but then I realize I have zero creativity and am not able to come up with anything and it eats at me..  There are days that I’m pretty unpleasant to be around simply because I have this ball of angst in the pit of my stomach because I feel like I need to create.. and can’t.    I have to settle for doing something less useful and less creative just to get something done.  Like, writing an entry.. or fixing a link or updating a footer ..etc..</p>

<p>Even then I screw things up.  Like the pagination on my blog is broken.  If you go to the end there are several “pages” that are empty.. bleh.
I have been meaning to turn this whole thing into a static JSON site but haven’t gotten around to it.  Again, no time, no creative juices, too much other shit going on.  I will fix it eventually.</p>

<p>I tried ot update to the latest version of Jekyll and .. wow.. Broke the world!  Reverted that until I can figure out why literally EVERYTHING is broken.</p>

<p>I really like the idea of making the entire site work like a windows desktop that would allow me to plant easter eggs and games.. etc.. I still want to make a game.. SO MUCH WANT TO MAKE A GAME!</p>

<p>Hell I even want to recreate Zork or Adventure or other text games in the site just for funzies.  I thought about trying to make a static blog / json M.U.D. just to see if I could.   I thought about it long and hard and I actually think I could pull it off with sockets and clever JSON design.  Maybe one day.  Maybe it’s here already and you just haven’t figured out how to lauch it yet.</p>

<p>My plane continues going and I recently ordered the fuselage so that’s cool.  I get to build more and more!  yay!  plus it’s cool having folks watch me.  I dunno why that keeps me motivated but it does.</p>

<p>I got a really nice trailer for $600!  Super excited about that.  I needed a way to transport things now that I have a jeep instead of a truck and getting a trailer made sense.  But the trailer I wanted was over a thousand dollars.  In fact, it was listed Lowes website for $1499.   I went to lowes to look at it and it was on sale.. for $599.   It was clearly mismarked, and in a line of other smaller trailers that were obviously the $599 trailers, but this one had the $599 sticker on it.  I asked the guy about it and he said, yeah that was correct.  I asked if he was sure, and he said yes.</p>

<p>The same trailer was in another row marked to $1299 so I’m just about 100% sure this thing was mismarked.. I’m not complaining.  Sometimes you win!  I tried to do the right thing and it paid off.</p>

<p>Not sure how I’m going to afford the engine for the plane yet… if someone wants to fund my plane let me know =)</p>

<p>Okay back to the grind.  I have been writing some software for my wifes work and it’s taking all my time.  I have put a LOT of time into it so far and I have a long way to go.</p>
