And sure as heck they did it here..\n\nThe interface is a little confusing at first, as it takes some time to understand what all the different commands do..  Plus as a whole the interface is kinda weak, but other than that I think this is an excellent game.\n\nI wish I could give each character more than the one weapon, but I understand why they did things the way they did and so I wont ding them on that.. All in all I think it's a very good game guys.. well done.\n\n4.5 out of 5 losing that half for some interface suckery..   Still, if you know me.. 4.5 is an awesome score.\n","collection":"posts","url":"/game-review-frozen-synapse/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2011-07-23-mandolin-luthiery.md","collection":"posts","url":"/mandolin-luthiery/","path":"_posts/2011-07-23-mandolin-luthiery.md","id":"/mandolin-luthiery","draft":false,"categories":["Hobbies"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Mandolin Luthiery -- Making and playing the Mandolin","layout":"post","tags":["Luthiery","Mandolin","Wood Working"],"image":"/images/2011/07/mandolin101.jpg","ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x2","private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2011-07-23 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"mandolin-luthiery","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2011-07-22-game-review-frozen-synapse.md","excerpt":"I have always been a huge fan of the turn based tactical isometric games such as Jagged Alliance, JA2, Xcom..etc..  So this new one excited me!","id":"/game-review-frozen-synapse","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Game Review: Frozen Synapse","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2011/07/frozensynapse.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2011-07-22 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"game-review-frozen-synapse","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2011-07-23-mandolin-luthiery.md","content":"<a href=\"/images/2011/07/mandolin101.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Ibanez Mandolin\" src=\"/images/2011/07/mandolin101-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Ibanez Mandolin\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Ibanez Mandolin</span></a>\n\nI have always enjoyed wood working and have done a bit of wood turning in my time.   And as I have <a title=\"I can play the radio...\" href=\"/play-the-radio/\">mentioned before</a> (<a title=\"Play the radio 2\" href=\"/play-the-radio-2/\">more than once</a>), I have always wanted to play an instrument of some kind..   Recently it occurred to me that there was no reason I couldn't combine these two activities..\n\nTo that end, I decided to try my hand at becoming a hobby luthier (a maker of stringed instruments) and make myself something to play..    I went back and forth considering all the options and decided that for my first instrument I'd like to make a Mandolin.  ( Dulcimer was a close second and I'll likely make one of those in the future, as well as making a Viola if I can manage to do this with any proficiency.  )\n\nSo with that I purchased an inexpensive <a href=\"http://www.ibanez.com/AcousticGuitars/model-M510DVS\" target=\"_blank\">Ibanez Mandolin</a> just to have an instrument to start learning on and use as a guide..  Since I have no experience what so ever, this instrument is what I will use to learn on and as a guide for what my instrument should sound like..  This wasn't a very expensive instrument, and it sounds fine to me.   I'm sure the really expensive / nice mandolins that are out there sound better but at this point I simply don't know the difference..   My end goal at this point is to make my home made mandolins sound as good as this one -- better would be nice, but I just am not sure what that means yet.\n\nThis will be a hobby activity for me and I'll very likely want to make more than one Mandolin, but first I need to attempt to make something that's reasonably close just as a learning exercise.   Not the \"finished\" product by any stretch but rather the first \"rough draft\" instrument that I can screw up on without fear of anything lost other than my time..\n\n<a href=\"/images/2011/07/mandolin103.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"Bluegrass Mandolin Construction Manual\" src=\"/images/2011/07/mandolin103-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Bluegrass Mandolin Construction Manual\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Bluegrass Mandolin Construction Manual</span></a>\n\nI fished around on the internet for reading / instructional material as well as any kits and came across a very good book put out by <a href=\"http://www.siminoff.net/pages/siminoff_books.html\" target=\"_blank\">Roger Siminoff</a> (a man with \"a little bit of experience\" on the issue having been doing this forever) on the construction of an f-type <a href=\"http://parts.siminoff.net/the-ultimate-bluegrass-mandolin-construction-manual.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">bluegrass mandolin</a>.  An excellent manual that basically walks you through the entire process one page at a time, complete with plans!   It's a good purchase and I can highly recommend it..\n\nRoger offers a really nice kit that seems to go with his book, but it costs over $500 and I just didn't think that would be a good beginners project.  So I settled on getting an inexpensive <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?um=1&amp;hl=en&amp;rlz=1C1CHFX_enUS431US431&amp;biw=1459&amp;bih=939&amp;q=Saga%20AM-10%20A-Model%20Mandolin%20Kit&amp;gs_sm=e&amp;gs_upl=9714l9714l0l10062l1l1l0l0l0l0l78l78l1l1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;tbo=u&amp;tbm=shop&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=if\" target=\"_blank\">Saga AM10 Mandolin Kit</a> to experiment on which I got off ebay for less than $90..\n\n<a href=\"/images/2011/07/mandolin0011.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Mandolin in Fixture\" src=\"/images/2011/07/mandolin0011-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Mandolin in Fixture\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Mandolin in Fixture</span></a>\n\nAs kit's go, I'd say this one is extremely rough, to the point of being bad, as very few of the parts matched up, even a little..  The instructions that came with it were meager at best, and very poor in most cases..  The strings it came with are worthless (the e string broke trying to bring it up to tension, I didn't even get it close to tuned and it popped)..  The back didn't fit the body at all, being undersized compared to the top and required a heck of a lot of work.. The neck didn't fit the main body at all, again a lot of work..etc..\n\n<a href=\"/images/2011/07/mandolin0021.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"Bottomless Mandolin\" src=\"/images/2011/07/mandolin0021-e1311459220144-150x112.jpg\" alt=\"Bottomless Mandolin\" width=\"150\" height=\"112\" /><br /><span>Bottomless Mandolin</span></a>\n\nI think a beginner woodworker would have had a very difficult time with this kit to be honest.. I have a lot of tools, experience and time with wood so it wasn't too bad for me but even so I had to make a bunch of jigs and fixtures in order to get things to line up and work correctly.   But even with my best effort just due to how it was cut my neck isn't correctly centered on the soundboard which will make stringing it interesting..   The tail piece is half an inch off center unfortunately which means the bridge is off center..etc..  I have no idea how that is going to affect the sound of the instrument but in all likelihood it won't do it justice.\n\nAll things considered though, I'm actually happy with my results so far..  It's taken me just shy of 3 weeks to get it all worked up and to the point of getting strings on it.  (Mostly working on the weekends and an hour or two in the evenings during the week when I could..\n\n<a href=\"/images/2011/07/mandolin003.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"One string Mandolin\" src=\"/images/2011/07/mandolin003-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"One string Mandolin\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>One string Mandolin</span></a>\n\nToday I added the very first string to the instrument and tuned it up just to see what it sounded like..  Shockingly it sounded like a D!  The instrument didn't have any kind of odd barks or vibrations though it does sound slightly different than the Ibanez I purchased above.\n\nI have added 4 other strings to it at this point and the difference in the sound is still there, but I simply am not articulate enough with sound and instrument theory to describe to you the difference.. it's just slightly different.. Not better, not worse.. different.\n\nEven so, I'm pretty happy so far with how things are going.\n\n","collection":"posts","url":"/mandolin-luthiery/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2011-07-23-mandolin-luthiery.md","collection":"posts","url":"/mandolin-luthiery/","path":"_posts/2011-07-23-mandolin-luthiery.md","id":"/mandolin-luthiery","draft":false,"categories":["Hobbies"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Mandolin Luthiery -- Making and playing the Mandolin","layout":"post","tags":["Luthiery","Mandolin","Wood Working"],"image":"/images/2011/07/mandolin101.jpg","ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x2","private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2011-07-23 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"mandolin-luthiery","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2011-08-11-adobe-software-subscriptions-missed-it-by-that-much.md","content":"<img class=\"pull-right\" title=\"\" src=\"/images/2011/08/adobe-logo-150x150.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" />\n\nI'm pretty strong supporter of Adobe products or at least I think I must be because I have purchased Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Premiere and Adobe After Effects as well as upgrading each many times.  I'm on my 4th or 5th iteration of photoshop at this point and after some quick and dirty math  I think Adobe has gotten well over $5000 of my hard earned money over the years.  These are all for my own personal use and because as a software engineer I think <a title=\"Software Piracy\" href=\"/software-piracy/\">software piracy is just wrong</a>.  Even so that still hurts a tad.\n\nRecently Adobe announced that they would be offering their software at rental subscription prices and I was excited!   What a great idea!!  But did they do it right?

Thanks for that.   Now if you don't mind I'm gonna go buy Flash Professional.\n","collection":"posts","url":"/adobe-software-subscriptions-missed-it-by-that-much/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2011-08-19-dont-buy-anything-from-ubisoft.md","collection":"posts","url":"/dont-buy-anything-from-ubisoft/","path":"_posts/2011-08-19-dont-buy-anything-from-ubisoft.md","id":"/dont-buy-anything-from-ubisoft","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Don't buy anything from Ubisoft...","layout":"post","tags":["BS","DRM","Piracy","Ubisoft"],"image":"/images/2011/08/ubisoft-no.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2011-08-19 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"dont-buy-anything-from-ubisoft","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2011-08-11-adobe-software-subscriptions-missed-it-by-that-much.md","excerpt":"Recently Adobe announced that they would be offering their software at rental subscription prices and I was excited!   What a great idea!!  But did they do it right?  I don't think so.. but they are so close!","id":"/adobe-software-subscriptions-missed-it-by-that-much","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Adobe software subscriptions -- Missed it by \"that much\"!","layout":"post","tags":["Adobe","Piracy","Software"],"image":"/images/2011/08/adobe-logo-150x150.png","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2011-08-11 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"adobe-software-subscriptions-missed-it-by-that-much","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2011-08-19-dont-buy-anything-from-ubisoft.md","content":"<img class=\"pull-right\" title=\"ubisoft-no\" src=\"/images/2011/08/ubisoft-no.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"129\" />\n\nIf you buy just about any product and have an issue with that product, you have a reasonable expectation of being able to take that product back and get a replacement.  Example;  Buy a TV and it doesn't work, you return it and get a new one.. Or return it and get your money back.  That new shirt not fit quite right?  Take it back..\n\nNot with software.  With software once purchased you're stuck with it.   There is typically a very strict \"no return\" policy, and this sucks.  It's to the point now where most stores wont even take back unopened software.  Once the transaction is done, its done.\n\nSo if you get that software home and it just plain doesn't work, you're hosed.  You're just out that money, and you have absolutely zero recourse other than to not purchase that companies software any more.  That's where I'm at with Ubisoft.\n\nThe reasoning for having zero recourse, and the reasoning you can't return software is very simple;  Software piracy.   If you buy a TV at Walmart you can't take it home and clone it.   But you can with software, so the industry as a whole assumes that everyone is out to clone their software because we are all dishonest, thus this 'no-return' shenanigans goes on in the name of loss prevention.\n\nI mean seriously, this is a whole industry that thinks and treats their customers as crooks..   What other industry blatantly dislikes and mistrusts their own customers this much?\n\nThe problem is that major software companies like Ubisoft bank on the fact that you can't return their shit, so they are more than happy to churn out crappy product after crappy product.   More over, since they know you have no recourse they don't bother to provide any form of support for those crappy products.    So this is <a title=\"Ubisoft and their DRM\" href=\"/ubisoft-and-their-drm/\">yet another example</a> of the software industry screwing the honest consumer.\n\nI purchased Silent Hunter 5 in the hopes of being able to play it, and it doesn't work.  It crashes every time I run it.  I have installed/reinstalled it a number of times and have followed all the instructions I can find.  I have updated all drivers on my system to include bios and mobo drivers and still have the exact same issue.  No other game has this issue except this one.\n\nIt still doesn't work.\n\nI have posted on the Ubisoft support forums and have gotten zero responses.  I submitted a ticket to Ubisoft about the issue only to have a canned response telling me that my drivers were out of date... which they aren't.\n\nI honestly and in good faith purchased this product to play it, and for whatever reason it doesn't work.  As a customer I believe I have a reasonable expectation of getting support for this product, but apparently that's not the case as zero support has been forthcoming.\n\nSo, I should be allowed to return it.   But I can't and they know it, and this pisses me off.   I'm just stuck with this dead piece of software.\n\nSo now my only recourse is to simply never buy anything Ubisoft again.  First you call me a crook by forcing me to use your <a title=\"Ubisoft and their DRM\" href=\"/ubisoft-and-their-drm/\">shitty DRM</a>, and now you call me a crook by refusing to let me return a product that is clearly broken all because you think I'm a pirate.\n\nSee.. the irony is, you guys hate your customers so much and fear software piracy so much that you have gone to such extraordinary lengths to stop it only to have succeeded in creating the very environment in which it's acceptable by even the most honest person..\n\nYou obviously hate your honest consumers, well I hate you back.  Fuck you Ubisoft, your dead to me.\n\nI will never buy another Ubisoft product.  You shouldn't either.\n","collection":"posts","url":"/dont-buy-anything-from-ubisoft/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2011-08-19-dont-buy-anything-from-ubisoft.md","collection":"posts","url":"/dont-buy-anything-from-ubisoft/","path":"_posts/2011-08-19-dont-buy-anything-from-ubisoft.md","id":"/dont-buy-anything-from-ubisoft","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Don't buy anything from Ubisoft...","layout":"post","tags":["BS","DRM","Piracy","Ubisoft"],"image":"/images/2011/08/ubisoft-no.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2011-08-19 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"dont-buy-anything-from-ubisoft","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2011-11-03-my-own-custom-blogging-software.md","content":"<a href=\"/images/2011/11/iframe.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Example\" src=\"/images/2011/11/iframe-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Example\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Click for Example</span></a>\n\nFinal Update:  Okay.. I owe a huge apology to the wordpress folks..  After doing a bunch of digging this isn't a wordpress bug at all, but rather a server exploit that someone used to edit a good portion of the .php files on my site in order to inject their shitty obfuscated iframe crap.  There were files that were edited completely outside the realm of wordpress, on my server that the wordpress user didn't even have access too.. So wordpress is completely off the hook!  Sorry guys.\n\nNow having said that I'm still planning on making my own blogging software for funsies.. but I am not feeling as much pressure now since I now know how to purge the iframes off and wordpress isn't to blame.\n\n\n__Update__: Click the image to the right to see the highlighted code that got injected into the site tonight.. I have no clue how it got in there and am actively taking steps to figure it out.. it's magically there one second then a refresh shows its gone..   I have tested my codebase thoroughly and I can't find it anywhere, nor can I find it in any of the javascript that is being called..  Either way,  Please don't install or run anything that you download from my site.  Note: I'm deactivating all extra plugins for the time being until I figure out whats causing this.*\n\nAs many of you know, I am very much my own special kind of nerd.  I enjoy doing many a'geeky thing that others wouldn't even dream of.  To be honest, I think all software engineers have to be a bit brain damaged just to do their job.  Recently my own affliction has been leading me down the path of writing my own blogging and content management system.\n\n\nI have used a lot of different packages over the years from full on CMS systems like Joomla and Mambo to more specific blogging solutions like Wordpress and Blogger..  They all have their good points and their bad points..  I have stuck with wordpress the longest as it most fit my need, but the more I dig into programming for wordpress the more I hate it..  I really think that wordpress needs to be rewritten from the ground up, but that's a post for a different thread..\n\nLong story short, I have decided to begin work on my very own blogging and content management system that is fully featured and professionally developed.    My ultimate goal is to make it a fully featured suite of tools that folks can install and use for their own site that has a very low bar to entry.    It should be easy to install and work seamlessly out of the box..etc..\n\nThe main reason lately that this has become an issue is that I'm tired of having folks hack/inject code into my headers and footers.   I have done everything I know to do to harden my wordpress install, yet I am still constantly fighting random crap showing up in the various theme files on the site.\n\nI hate it!\n\nIt's frustrating and not fun.  More over, if they have the ability to do that then they have the ability to inject all manner of malicious code..\n\nSo with that I'm going to begin designing and building something that can do all the work I need and take all the stuff already done (all of my wordpress blog) and convert it.. etc..\n\nGonna be a lot of work.. design will be huge, but should be good in the long run if for no other reason than something fun to do..  yes.. I see this as fun..\n\n","collection":"posts","url":"/my-own-custom-blogging-software/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2012-01-03-2011-swtor-ipad2.md","collection":"posts","url":"/2011-swtor-ipad2/","path":"_posts/2012-01-03-2011-swtor-ipad2.md","id":"/2011-swtor-ipad2","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"2011, SWTOR, and iPad2","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2012/01/2012.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2012-01-03 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"2011-swtor-ipad2","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2011-11-03-my-own-custom-blogging-software.md","excerpt":"As many of you know, I am very much my own special kind of nerd.  I enjoy doing many a'geeky thing that others wouldn't even dream of.  To be honest, I think all software engineers have to be a bit brain damaged just to do their job.","id":"/my-own-custom-blogging-software","draft":false,"categories":["Software Development"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"My own custom blogging software","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2011/11/iframe.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2011-11-03 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"my-own-custom-blogging-software","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2011-08-19-dont-buy-anything-from-ubisoft.md","excerpt":"If you buy just about any product and have an issue with that product, you have a reasonable expectation of being able to take that product back and get a replacement.
