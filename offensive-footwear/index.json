I have a daunting task ahead of me..\n\nI told my friends that there would be no way in hell I could paint all 100+ models in the time left.. It's just not possible..  That's when my buddy got after me to use the \"dip\" method of painting..  It's fast and easy, and you don't have to \"color in the lines\"..\n\nSo tonight I gave it a try..\n\n\nI knew that if I were going to have full 2000 point 40k Ork army ready for this tourney I'd have to paint each model in about 10 minutes, so that's what I did..  I gave myself 10 minutes to paint the model.  Period.   (Not counting the spray prime dry time or dip dry time.)\n\nI went to the store and got some light tan colored spray paint that I'd use as my primer/base coat.   It's pretty light in color but I knew the dip/stain would make it darker so that's what I went with..\n\n__0:30__ -- I came home and randomly selected one Ork not knowing if this would work worth a damn.   I took all of 30 seconds or so to prime the model with the spray paint then let it dry.  It took about 30 minutes to fully dry because I got the spray can nozzle a tad too close..\n\nI then went inside to prepare my painting area.. I selected the 5 colors I was going to use, Boltgun metal, Catachan Green, Fortress Grey, Brazen Brass, and Calthan Brown and then got my water, paper towels and brushes ready.\n\n__9:30__ -- Once the primer was dry I sat down and hit the stop watch.   I then took 9 minutes to paint the arms green, the helm and gun boltgun metal, some bitz got a bit of brown and some others got some grey while his shoulder piece got brass..   I was going to do some more brown and grey but the clock hit 9 and I put the brush down.\n\nThere is more I wanted to do, but I stopped at 9 minutes.\n\n__10:00__ -- I picked up the model and walked out to the garage where I already had the can of minwax stain open and ready to receive..   I used a pair of vice grips to dip the model all the way to the base in the stuff and let it sit in there for about 5 seconds..\n\nI pulled it out and shook it off as hard as I could into the trash can making sure it got all the drips..\n\nThat's it.. Done.  You see the results above.  It takes about 6 hours to get to the point where you can handle the model, and then a full 12 hours to make it so it's not tacky (or so I'm told.. I haven't passed the 12 hour mark)..\n\nA couple things yet to do is to spray paint a matte or satin varnish to dull some of that shine, paint the base black again (Should have done this prior to gluing to base.. lesson learned), and finally flock the base..\n\nIt's not perfect by any stretch but as a 10 minute paint job it's not half bad.   I'm going to refine my process and paint like 10 at a time to speed things up but this is definately my process.. here it is.. this is how I'm doing it..\n\nI'll post more pictures once I get more.   I'll also post a left and right comparison of a model I actually took 2 hours painting versus one that is dipped just to see..\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2009/06/30minloota.jpg\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"30 Minute Loota\" src=\"/images/2009/06/30minloota-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"30 Minute Loota\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>30 Minute Loota</span></a>\n\n__Additional:__\n\nSo after some game play I decided I needed some Loota's in my army.  Here is one I painted using my new method.. It takes a bit longer in total due to all the bitz that are there to paint.   So probably 30 minutes total went into this one.  I haven't flocked the base or matted the model yet so its a tad shiney still..  Either way this method works very well here too..\n","collection":"posts","url":"/ork-dip-the-10-minute-paint-job/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2009-08-03-wowvswar.md","collection":"posts","url":"/wowvswar/","path":"_posts/2009-08-03-wowvswar.md","id":"/wowvswar","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"WoWvsWar","layout":"post","tags":["Warhammer"],"image":"/images/2009/08/wowvswar.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-08-03 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"wowvswar","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2009-06-07-ork-dip-the-10-minute-paint-job.md","excerpt":"So I am going to be entering in a 40k tournament in August.  I'll be entering as an Ork player and have been tuning and playing various lists in preparation..   I have a lot left to do though.. ","id":"/ork-dip-the-10-minute-paint-job","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Ork Dip!

Their only other game of note is Dark Age of Camelot which was a one trick pony (realm versus realm combat) that has no long term play associated with it..   And while the game is still around, it's just not fun.  There is nothing there to keep players like me playing the game.. I just don't enjoy it nor does it have the massive fan base that it could have if they had bothered to keep innovating.\n\nWoW on the other hand has gobs and gobs of things to do long term as well as lots of mindless achievements and other end game elements to keep players attention.  They are adding new content and new fun things to the game all the time and this is from a guy who really doesn't like WoW..\n\nWhen it comes to long term play, WoW is the clear winner.  I play it still today and have for a while now.   My guild has killed the end game boss (Yogg) many times at this point and is starting to work on getting to the next guy..\n\nI'm playing WAR too at this point, but it's just not that fun and my interest is waning.. As I played WAR originally (and as I am relearning more recently), I realize it is exactly the same game as DAoC just in a slightly different universe.  It suffers the same issues that DAoC did and really brings very little new to the table..\n\nWhat WAR does wrong:\n\n*  The PVE aspects of the game are absolutely horrible..  The questing is painfully linear and just about always forces you to venture into PVP areas even if you don't want to.\n* The zone's are confusing and poorly laid out which makes navigation with out the flight system near impossible.\n* The flight mechanic from zone to zone is long loading and lame -- considering that you must use it, it needs an overhaul.\n* The models are pretty bad, but the animations are down right dreadful...\n* I can go on and on but will leave it be as otherwise this list will be too long...\n\nWhat WAR does right:\n\nPQ's, SC's and PVP.\n\nThe public quest system is neat and I wouldn't be surprised if blizzard \"adopts\" such a system in the near future..  It's well thought out and works quite nicely.   This I think is likely to be the single innovation that folks will remember WAR for in several years..\n\nSo far the majority of the scenarios (SC's.. Think battlegrounds for you WoW players) are a lot of fun.  Again way more so than any of the BG's in WoW which I find to be tedious and boring.\n\nDAoC's big plus was the Realm versus Realm thing.. Mythic of course followed that same model in producing WAR and as such their PVP model is excellent.  The realm versus realm thing is a lot of fun.. for a while.. it becomes tedious and boring fairly quickly, but still the PVP is very good.\n\nThe PVP in WAR is far far far better than what is offered by WoW.   Period.  Full stop.\n\nThe reason for that is how the classes are balanced as well as the fact that blocking is turned on.   In WoW it's perfectly reasonable for a frail clothy to stand toe to toe with a fella in full plate and win.  Generally in WoW PVP any one class well played, can defeat any one other class..  What's the point?\n\nIn War, this is unreasonable and usually punished harshly.   As a bright wizard (weak clothy) I know that if a tank (guy in plate) charges me I have only a few seconds to react before death.. I better make them count!  Each class in the game has a specific function and is only really good at that function!\n\nWith blocking turned on (collision detection) the tanks can stand in front of the more frail classes and prevent them from being slaughtered..\n\nThe only place that this fails WAR is you have a lot of WoW players playing WAR who don't realize their place and as such just charge in and die, or refuse to block, or simply wont heal..etc.    I can't fault War for the players being stupid..\n\nThe problem here is that the game somewhat encourages players to play stupidly in that even if they don't work together in a SC the losing team still gets' a lot of experience for it.. but that's an aside.. again I really can't fault Mythic for morons..\n\nWhat I can do though is fault Mythic for producing a game that is so completely unrefined.  There are so many little things about War that is a complete fail..\n\nThe Macro system is bad.. The map system sucks.. The models are lame.. The animations are really bad.. The PVE content is tedious.. Some of the classes seem out of balance.. The crafting system is horrible and pointless.. etc..   It's just not that fun of a game and a lot of that is due to these little things..\n\nLet me be perfectly clear.  I don't like World of Warcraft.  I don't enjoy the universe at all, the stylistic game play, the mindless grinding, the life sucking raiding..etc..    I play it solely because my wife enjoys it..  Fine I'll play for her..  But I don't really like it.   I do however have to say that Blizzard has made a good game.   It's very refined in that stuff works.  It has it's own problems too.. (the inability to launch more dungeon instances is a big one.. )   But over all WoW is a good game.\n\nMythic with WAR however isn't all that good.  It really seems like they doggedly stuck to their one trick (realm vs realm) in the hopes that it would make a WoW Killer and not bother to innovate.  Okay fine, PQ's.. but that's ONE thing..   And of course just as DAoC's one trick failed to make the game a success, the exact same trick on WAR also failed..\n\nThe real issue I have is, it's been a year..  the game has done nothing in that time and at this point it doesn't look like its going to do anything..  If they don't care enough to fix their game, or innovate and make it better.. then I don't care enough to play it..\n\nCan't fix stupid.\n","collection":"posts","url":"/wowvswar/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2009-08-03-wowvswar.md","collection":"posts","url":"/wowvswar/","path":"_posts/2009-08-03-wowvswar.md","id":"/wowvswar","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"WoWvsWar","layout":"post","tags":["Warhammer"],"image":"/images/2009/08/wowvswar.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-08-03 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"wowvswar","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2009-08-06-offensive-footwear.md","content":"<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2009/08/feets.png\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Offensive Footwear\" src=\"/images/2009/08/feets-150x150.png\" alt=\"Offensive Footwear\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Offensive Footwear</span></a>\n\nSo a <a title=\"Scream of Consciousness\" href=\"http://gonzo.worlord.com\" target=\"_blank\">co-worker of mine</a> showed up wearing what, at the time, I could only describe as \"glove shoes\".  They are sort of like water socks, where each toe has its own sleeve to fit in.  They looked quite comfy and interested me..  I talked to him about it a bit and finally decided, what the heck..

In fact I would go as far as to say its pretty good and appears to be getting better with each patch..\n\nI certainly can say that as the beta has progressed the game has gotten Waaaaayy better and will very likely continue to do so for a good while yet..  And I can further say that it's good enough for me to actually purchase and play the game after release, but there are issues I hope get solved..\n\nFrom day 1 when I started in the beta I had extremely high hopes.   Extremely high..  Like.. Too high.. heh\n\nI wanted Champions online to be exactly what Champions is;  a \"sky is the limit\" paper and pencil role playing game where the player can create any kind of hero they want and effectively play within the realm of the GM's imagination..   If you as a player could imagine it,  then you could do it!  Booyah baby!\n\nI pretty much had the same hopes for City of Heroes previously and of course was let down for many of the same reasons which I'll get to..  (Note;  I liked City of Heroes and played it for a good long time but it never had the freedom and versatility that it had originally promised. )\n\nChampions Online suffers from this exact same issue -- our expectations are too high.  It's completely unrealistic to think that they could create a game where players could be ANYTHING..  I mean how do you even create the framework that can encompass a whole generation of players imaginations?!  Powers, Abilities, Costumes.. etc   You can't.. Period.. There's just no way..\n\nThis problem isn't really a problem, it's a matter of the player needing to lower their expectations a tad..   But they did call their game \"Champions\" online so of course that makes people hope for just such a thing..\n\nSo instead of trying they went the same route that they had used with City of Heroes, which is a good thing to be honest.\n\nWhat they did was to limit everything down to a set or subset of powers that you can choose from when building your super hero.  They do the same thing with costumes in that there are a finite number of elements you can choose from.\n\nIn City of Heroes you could spend days just playing with the character creator designing your hero.. Not powers or attributes, but just creating what your hero looks like.  Multiply that by a factor of 4 and you have the new character creator.  It's quite nice in that you can create just about anything.    I had a lot of fun tooling around in the character generator and made all manner of silly to serious characters.  The creator had some bugs of course, its still early in development, but it was still pretty neat.\n\nThe power sets right now seem somewhat limited..  I wish/want there to be way more powers.. I also was under the impression that we would have more control over what powers looked like..  I swear I read somewhere that you could have the same \"blast\" power that someone else had, but you could control what it graphically looks like or what color it was etc.. and that's not the case..  In some cases you can control where the power originates (hands, head, chest..etc) but that seems to be it..\n\nMaybe later in the game you can control how powers appear but for now I don't see that ability..\n\nThe game play is sort of what you'd expect from \"City of Heroes' 2\" which is all Champions Online is.  Its fun, but don't expect anything super awesome like..\n\nMy major complaint with the game at this point was a graphic setting that defaulted to on, and made the game look horrible..   They had \"Depth of Field\" turned on, which meant that the farther away from the camera an object/item/scene was, the blurier it was.  It got so blurry during one scene it was hard to look at.. it actually made me a little ill..  I had to turn DOF off completely..\n\nI'm not sure I fully appreciate the cell shading thing to be honest.. I understand why they went that way, and I believe in the long run it will stand the test of time better than a more \"realistic\" theme..  I just don't really like it yet..   I have the same issue with the stylistic graphics of World of Warcraft.. its just a personal opinion thing really..\n\nAll in all I think the game is good..\n\nI very much recommend it.. and if you liked City of Heroes I think you'll really like Champions Online..\n","collection":"posts","url":"/game-review-champions-online/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2009-08-12-game-review-champions-online.md","collection":"posts","url":"/game-review-champions-online/","path":"_posts/2009-08-12-game-review-champions-online.md","id":"/game-review-champions-online","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Game Review: Champions Online","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2009/08/defender1-champ-online-415-150x150.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-08-12 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"game-review-champions-online","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2009-08-14-28-hdmi-monitor.md","content":"<img title=\"Huge Monitor\" src=\"/images/2009/08/monitor-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Huge Monitor\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" class='pull-right' />\n\nSo Tigerdirect was having a hell of a deal on something I have sorta wanted for  a while...   I have been playing games, programming, and generally tooling around on a 20\" wide screen monitor for years now.\n\nMy old 20\" wide screen viewsonic worked great to be sure..  I really liked it and when I moved it from my old 17\" square monitor I thought I had found eden..   Well let me tellya.. This new monitor is something like six inches bigger all the way around and I have found nirvana...\n\nAll for $279.  *gleee*   For the record that's less than what I had paid for my 20\" wide screen a couple years ago.. This new monitor is way bigger and has better stats all around, for less!\n\nI have my new monitor replacing the old on the wall mount behind my desk..  I love technology..\n\nThe first thing I noticed about this monitor was how bright it was.. As soon as I turned it on it was blinding compared to my old screen..  I'm sure I'll get used to it, but dang..\n\nThe other thing that was fun was that I logged into my current first person shooter and had to actually turn my head, to see the whole screen!!! hehe   Gona give a couple of my simulation games a try here soon.. I bet it will be awesome..\n\n<table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<h3 id=\"detailspecs\">Specifications</h3>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<table
