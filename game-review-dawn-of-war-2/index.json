But I get ahead of myself.\n\n__Firstly, what it's not;__\n\nThe blizzard folks over at their forums, as well as those you get ahold of on the phone.. and via email will try to blame everything on you.  The reason for this will come clear shortly, but in a way they are right and in a way wrong.\n\nThe World of Warcraft #134 error is so vague and broad in scope that it is the support equivalent to, \"It broke!\"...  It could be any number of things, but the thing they just about always tell you it is, is memory.  Read the forums and you'll always see some asshat chiming in that it must be your memory..  The issue I had with that response is that I had run tests against my 4 gigs of memory both in linux, and in windows using multiple tools as well as testing each stick individually..  My memory was flawless every time.. even using the test blizzard suggested I use.\n\nOnce I proved that, they suddenly tried to blame some other facet of my hardware..  Long story short, everything they suggested WAS WRONG.  Period..\n\nSo I got to looking into why they always insisted it was memory.. And how the MPQ files which should be read-only archives of data were getting corrupted.    Why the hell was blizzard writing back to those files..\n\n(Note: most of this is what I have gleaned while looking into it as well as relying on my own and coworkers programming knowledge.. it's not 100% for sure, but an edjumikated guess.)\n\nThe MPQ files that WoW uses contain all the various objects, models, textures and what nots that the game needs to play.   The majority of those things are textures that the system needs to constantly load to display..  The problem is the MPQ's are many gigs in size, and as of yet no graphics card has that much on board memory..  Nor do most systems have enough space to load the entire game into memory..  To get around this blizzard employed a technique called memory mapping.\n\nWithout going into too much detail, the addresses for the chunks of the data it needs is mapped directly to the hard drive and stuffed into the graphics card memory.. (Or more likely into main memory, then replicated into the graphics card memory.. but thats not important.)  These functions are controlled by windows entirely and out of the games control.  That's why there is writing going on.  For the most part they use this technique to speed things up other wise your computers hard drive and bus would be completely hammered trying to shuffle all the textures around.. And WoW is nothing if not texture packed..\n\nAny time anything changes in memory, it writes those changes directly back to the file -- this is simply due to the nature of memory mapping in windows..  (playing WoW in Linux will not have this problem, it will have a completely different problem if the ultimate issue is the same)\n\nIf there are no changes, then nothing gets written back -- this is what's supposed to happen as blizzard knows (or assumes) that the textures wont get changed.  But lets say something did change and blizzard knows that their client didn't make that change..  The only thing that could have happened was something broke.\n\nThis is the reason blizzard naturally tells you that your memory is bad, and often why they say virus scanners could play a part too, or even a hard drive..  If the memory went bad then a couple bits would change forcing windows to write back to the MPQ corrupting it.. Or if there is bad sectors on the hard drive where the pagefile is, same problem.. etc..\n\n__What it actually was;__\n\nWhat they fail to tell you about is.. what if the memory on your graphics card is bad?  That's much harder to test..\n\nMy problem ended up being a bug with the EVGA built nVidia 8800GTX graphics card.  Apparently the fan on the graphics card wouldn't correctly auto-increase in speed which meant my graphics card over heated at some point.. (You can download the <a href=\"http://www.evga.com/precision/\" target=\"_blank\">EVGA Precision tool</a> to fix this manually)  Which ultimately meant the memory on my graphics card started to corrupt.. It only got worse as time went on because the heat problem continued to be an issue, eventually causing the card to die completely.\n\nThe 8800GTX was a great card and it worked for me flawlessly for 2 years before this issue showed up so I can't complain about it at all.. The main issue with it was it routinely operated around 80 degrees Celsius..   With an operational ceiling of 105... that's pretty slim margins and almost begs to overheat..\n\nBut, In a weird way, the blizzard folks were right;  it was a memory issue.  Just not in the way they were insisting it was..   What they didn't realize and probably still don't realize was that it wasn't system memory that was causing the corruption.   More over, none of the tests they suggest would have ever revealed any of those issues.\n\nFrom my perspective, my system was working flawlessly because unless a software package actually tried to use any of the faulty memory on the graphics card, everything appeared to work perfectly.    I still have the 8800gtx card and can plug it into a system right now and so long as you don't try to play a game on it, it works perfectly in windows and linux.\n\nFor me the fix meant I had to replace my graphics card.. I pop'ed the 8800gtx out and installed a <a href=\"http://www.nvidia.com/object/buy_now_results.html?id=GTX285\" target=\"_blank\">nVidia GTX 285</a> and everything works peachy..  My system is back up and happy and so am I.  For a while there I was dreading playing the game because I knew it would crash any second..\n\nMy new card under full load operates at 51ºc (thirty degrees cooler than the 8800 at idle) and all is well...\n\nThe thing I really take out of this is how poorly I was treated by the blizzard support folks.  I'm actually aghast at how bad their support is.  Not because they couldn't come up with a fix, this was a tough one.. but because they were so nonchalant about it and didn't seem to remotely care.\n\nAfter all, I'm just one of eleven million subscribers.. who gives a crap if I'm happy right?\n\nIf you're having #134's, check to make sure your system isn't over heating..  Run the various memory testers, but keep in mind that you have memory on your graphics card that as far as I know, you can't test and it could be the culprit.  If you have tried everything else, try swapping in a new graphics card..\n\nGood luck.\n\n","collection":"posts","url":"/wow134fix/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2009-01-30-wow134fix.md","collection":"posts","url":"/wow134fix/","path":"_posts/2009-01-30-wow134fix.md","id":"/wow134fix","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"World of Warcraft, #134 Error -- Fixed","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-01-30 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"wow134fix","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2009-02-01-game-review-dawn-of-war-2.md","content":"<img title=\"Dawn of War 2\" src=\"/images/2009/02/dawn-of-war-2-1642-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Dawn of War 2\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" class='pull-right' />\n\nI love Warhammer.  I have played Warhammer table top war game both fantasy and 40k pretty much since they came out.  I also have the Warhammer fantasy role playing game, the more recent Warhammer 40k role playing game and gave the Warhammer fantasy MMO a spin.\n\nGames workshop has done a really good job at creating a compelling IP (too bad blizzard stole most of it.. but I digress)..

I didn't switch to 98 until 99.. I didn't go to NT at all, and stayed on W2k Pro until well after XP was out.  The only reason I went XP was because it was on the new computer I had purchased already..\n\nMy reason for not wanting to upgrade to the newest version of windows was usually because it's painful, the upgrade sucks and quite often I have to go back.  (I wont even go into my Windows ME story.. I had one of the Microsoft Windows ME senior developers tell me to go back to 98 because ME sucked...  Yeah.. It happened..)\n\nMore over upgrading isn't the way to go.. you should wipe fresh and start over..  I usually dreaded this..   What cured that?  Funnily enough, Ubuntu..\n\nI have installed and reinstalled ubuntu so many times I'm an old hat at it..  It's really easy.    So I went into Windows 7 thinking it was going to be back to the pain..  And was pleasantly surprised..\n\nFirstly what Windows 7 isn't;  It isn't a new OS.  Lets be clear here.. Windows 7 is what Vista should have been.  It's more than a reskin to be sure, but mostly it's a refactor of Vista and a general rebranding to get away from the down right awful publicity that Vista rightly deserved..\n\nHaving said that, I like W7 quite a bit actually.  I have had some issues getting my sound card drivers working, but now that I do everything's peachy.   Because it's entirely based on the Vista core just download and install Vista drivers for it and as a rule you're good to go.\n\nThe install process was simple and clean, and since I installed it on a new drive it correctly put the windows bootloader on the main drive (though it did overwrite my grub loader so now I can't get into linux.. will have to add the linux install to windows bootloader..)    The install was fairly quick all things considered, and it configured all my hardware correctly.\n\nI had World of Warcraft up and running within about 3 minutes of installing the OS because I had precopied it to the drive heh.   Yay I have DX10 now!\n\nMy biggest complaint at this point is two fold;  1. the alt+tab functionality seems really slow and clunky in W7.. In XP its instant.. but for whatever reason in W7 it takes a couple seconds.. Minor complaint though really.. it is a beta after all..\n\nSecondly, I want to know what will happen in August when the license expires..  Will I just be screwed and have to reinstall all over again?  They have already stated that you wont be able to install the automatic updates beyond that point and that the OS will die then.. I find that... Odd..\n\nOH well.. I can say that I would likely purchase this OS if it continues to perform as nicely as it does now.  Since it's the premier gaming platform for PC's at this point I don't have much choice.. heh\n\nI still very much like my Mac.. I still very much like Ubuntu.. but the games demand Dx10, so <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">Vista</span>.. er,  Windows 7 it is..\n","collection":"posts","url":"/windows-7-beta/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2009-02-05-windows-7-beta.md","collection":"posts","url":"/windows-7-beta/","path":"_posts/2009-02-05-windows-7-beta.md","id":"/windows-7-beta","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Software Review: Windows 7 Beta","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2009/02/vista_7_1-150x150.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-02-05 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"windows-7-beta","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2009-03-09-game-review-empire-total-war.md","content":"<img title=\"Empire:Total War\" src=\"/images/2009/03/empire_christmas2007_1024x768-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Empire: Total War!\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" class='pull-right' />\n\nSo I have long been a fan of the Total War franchise created by Creative Assembly..  Their games have always been pretty fun -- but most of them have been fairly buggy..  There was a lot of stuff going on and the games were generally still playable, so for the most part those bugs could be forgiven.\n\nEmpire Total War is the latest in the franchise and easily the most anticipated as well as the most well received..  All the various publications have drooled over this game and praised it for being pure liquid awesome as well as having given it a 94 meta score which pretty much assures it will be the game of the year..\n\nI read everything I could find about it and was very much looking forward to this game -- I do enjoy it for the most part.  I just don't feel it deserves quite all the hype is has gotten.  More over I kind of wonder if the Creative Assembly folks didn't pay for some of those favorable reviews... Either that or the reviewers didn't play the same game they published..\n\nI'm going to complain a bit now, but let me say that the game is good and I do like it.   It's major failing at this point is the vast number of bugs..\n\nSo, as good as it is now, it will be even better once they fix all the annoying bugs, and man are there ever a lot of them..  But the potential is so huge I can't wait.. I'm still playing the hell out of it and I do for the most part enjoy it, but the bugs detract from the game something awful.\n\nThere are quite a few memory leak style bugs where the game eventually will crash just due to repeated play or long term play.. Feh.. No big deal.   I completely understand this sort of thing and can forgive it.\n\nThe big issue is the horrible AI employed by the enemy.   The whole point of this game is to have combat in the form of 18th century gun lines where out maneuvering your opponent is as important as the shots fired..\n\nThe computer doesn't do any of that..  It just masses troops towards you in huge blocks of chaos..  Things like buildings and walls completely confuse the AI and a lot of the time they will just stand there stupidly while you blow them away.\n\nOr you will go out of your way to develop a clever tactic only to have the game ignore you completely and march all their troops in a straight line for no apparent reason..\n\nIt's almost impossible to lose a combat at this point just because the AI is retarded.. It's unfortunate, but true..\n\nFrankly, the AI is just appaulingly bad..  I know this stuff is hard, but it really shouldn't have been shipped in the state it is in.  I don't blame the developer for this, this is yet another in a long line of games being pushed out the door before they were ready.  It really sucks that publishers are STILL doing this.\n\nLook, I understand that a game (any game) is lost revinue until the game is out the door, but releasing it before it's ready only hurts your bottom line.  It hurts your bottom line for years to come!  Releasing a game before its ready to be released pisses off the fan base making them not want to buy your next game.   It's extremely short sited to publish a game thinking that you'll fix it in a patch.  You guys need to stop doing it!\n\nSo.. all in all, the game is good.. I give it a strong 4 out of 5..  What keeps it from being a 5 out of 5 is the horrible AI.  That's the only thing..  There are other issues that folks complain about, like the lack of unique uniforms or some little nitpicky details about the animations.. feh.. I can look past that entirely..  The AI is hard to get past..\n\nLets hope they stay true to their model and support the game for a while.. If they patch the AI a bit, the game will be worth every bit of that 94..\n","collection":"posts","url":"/game-review-empire-total-war/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2009-03-11-jquery-lightbox.md","collection":"posts","url":"/jquery-lightbox/","path":"_posts/2009-03-11-jquery-lightbox.md","id":"/jquery-lightbox","draft":false,"categories":["Software Development"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"jQuery Lightbox","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2009/03/rocky-mountains-poster.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-03-11 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"jquery-lightbox","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2009-03-09-game-review-empire-total-war.md","excerpt":"So I have long been a fan of the Total War franchise created by Creative Assembly..  Their games have always been pretty fun -- but most of them have been fairly buggy..","id":"/game-review-empire-total-war","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Game Review: Empire: Total War","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2009/03/empire_christmas2007_1024x768-150x150.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-03-09 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"game-review-empire-total-war","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2009-02-05-windows-7-beta.md","excerpt":"I'm generally slow to change operating systems..  When it comes to making one of those sweeping changes, traditionally I was the equivalent of an old man on his porch yelling for \"you kids to get off my lawn!\"   I was a curmudgeon and quite often would refuse to budge.","id":"/windows-7-beta","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Software Review: Windows 7 Beta","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2009/02/vista_7_1-150x150.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-02-05 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"windows-7-beta","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2009-02-01-game-review-dawn-of-war-2.md","excerpt":"I love Warhammer.  I have played Warhammer table top war game both fantasy and 40k pretty much since they came out.  I also have the Warhammer fantasy role playing game, the more recent Warhammer 40k role playing game and gave the Warhammer fantasy MMO a spin.","id":"/game-review-dawn-of-war-2","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Game Review: Dawn of War 2","layout":"post","tags":["Warhammer","Review"],"image":"/images/2009/02/dawn-of-war-2-1642-150x150.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-02-01 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"game-review-dawn-of-war-2","ext":".md"}
