NTW is by far the most refined version so far and a lot of fun but, I'm not quite sure it peeks the \"great\" meter just yet.. I will say its pretty darn good and a lot of fun though..\n\nTotally worth the price as it's clear to me that Creative Assembly (the developers) are getting better at their craft but the game has one staggering short fall that it shares with all it's siblings;  Horrible AI.\n\nThis is the 6th iteration of the game core concept and the AI is still just dreadful..  I'm pretty sure we could train a monkey to play the game better..  I know AI is very complex and as a programmer myself I'm not sure how to solve this problem, but dang..  The computer is down right bad.   Given enough time you probably could beat any army with just about any force..  It's actually fun trying to do just that.. heh\n\nIn comparison to Empire Total War, it's immediate predecessor, Napoleon is the clear winner.  The game is much more polished and refined than ETW ever was and it makes me feel like ETW was what NTW was supposed to be, but they ran out of time and money..  I will say that the AI in NTW is better than ETW, but when up is the only possible direction....\n\nI will say this, NTW is beautiful.. There is nothing cooler than watching your line of infantry slowly disappear in a hazy cloud of black powder smoke as a line of enemy advance forward.. Or the small skip gashes that are cut into the scenery as a cannon ball goes whizzing by.. Great stuff..  The level of care and detail there is pretty high..\n\nBut the AI is so dumb that the enemy unit of 120 line infantry will happily walk into a line of cannon..  Or horse melee units that charge into the barriers (only to die immediately in droves)..  Or how the diplomacy system is completely pointless..etc..\n\nThe AI is the killer.. It's just not good..\n\nOne way they got around that was to introduce the notion of \"drop in battles\" in which you can, during your single player campaign, enlist a friend (or complete stranger even) to play the part of the enemy during some of the battles.   I will admit.. This was a damn good and innovative idea.. Well done guys..  I love this..\n\nWhats nice about it is that the other player when he's playing your enemy, or when you're playing his enemy in his campaign, isn't really invested in the same way..  So if he loses it's almost like it's not a personal loss.. after all its not like you chose the force..etc..   I like it.. this was a good addition to the game..\n\nFor the next iteration of the game I hope they go more into the trading, and economy aspects of the game.   I want to be able to set individual tax rates for a single province.. or define whats being traded where..etc..  Right now its fairly limited.. you're either trading or not.. etc..  I know this game is more about the killin and less about things like trade and diplomacy but I still would like a more rounded game experience in these areas..\n\nAll in all... Not \"great\".. but pretty damn good and a lot of fun against like minded friends..\n\nAdditional;\n\nI really think Games Workshop should get with Creative Assembly and make Warhammer Total War.. Dear god.. talk about two franchises that absolutely belong together..  This engine, plus GW's IP?!  WIN!!  It would be like chocolate and peanut butter man..\n\nHow cool would it be to see a pack of Skaven march into a pack of Witchelves (dead Skaven)..  Or see a bunch of Jezzails take out some Coldone Knights.. etc..  Hot..\n\nI think this is such a good idea I'm going to send them a letter...\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2010-05-01-game-review-splintercell-conviction.md","url":"/game-review-splintercell-conviction/","relative_path":"_posts/2010-05-01-game-review-splintercell-conviction.md","id":"/game-review-splintercell-conviction","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Game Review: Splintercell Conviction","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2010/05/tom_clancys_splinter_cell_conviction-4.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":true,"allow_comments":false,"date":"2010-05-01 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"game-review-splintercell-conviction","ext":".md"},"url":"/game-review-napoleon-total-war/","relative_path":"_posts/2010-05-13-game-review-napoleon-total-war.md","id":"/game-review-napoleon-total-war","collection":"posts","excerpt":"I have always been a fan of the Total War franchise, but in my opinion none of them have been all that great.  Good and fun in most cases, sure..","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Game Review: Napoleon Total War","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2010/05/napoleon-150x150.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":true,"allow_comments":false,"date":"2010-05-13 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"game-review-napoleon-total-war","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2010-05-01-game-review-splintercell-conviction.md","output":null,"content":"<a rel=\"lightbox\" class='pull-right fancybox' href=\"/images/2010/05/tom_clancys_splinter_cell_conviction-4.jpg\"><img title=\"Splintercell Conviction\" src=\"/images/2010/05/tom_clancys_splinter_cell_conviction-4-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Splintercell Conviction</span></a>\n\nI really like a good first person shooter..  But most FPS games these days aren't about thinking or planning your way out, they are just run and gun, \"zerg-fests\" where you run in shoot a few.. die, respawn, run in shoot a few, die, respawn.. wash, rinse, repeat..  Boring..\n\nThe new Splintercell game isn't this..  I would call it more of a first person sneaker.  In that it's entirely conceivable to play through large swaths of the game without firing a shot, and that's just cool..\n\nAs with any game it has it's ups and downs, but over all its up and I think UBISoft has set themselves up with a game that they can kick out a lot of downloadable content for, if they leverage this correctly..\n\nThings that make this game stand out for me are the little details, like the movement mechanics.. Frankly, I think the movement mechanics are great!   And the cover system is fantastic, unlike some other games I have played recently..  It did take a little getting used to some aspects of it; like I'd prefer the shift key to not be a toggle for run/walk but rather be a press and hold kind of thing but that's largely because it's what I'm used to with other games, not because its inherently wrong..\n\nThere are lots of different weapons that you can use ( or not use ) and you have options to upgrade them..  There are also a whole pack of different thrown gadgets that you can use and they all have their use..\n\nI also really like the color vs black/white mechanic..  At first I thought this would be jarring and break the suspension of disbelief but the opposite was true.. I feel it actually helps a lot..\n\nLots of textual help everywhere which again I thought would be distracting or break the suspension, but actually they way they worked it in was great and made it sorta feel like a movie..\n\nReally my complaints about the game are minor;\n\n1.  The game is short -- I finished the game in 11 hours, and I was going slow.. I'm pretty sure you could finish it a heck of a lot faster than that if you tried..  It seemed really complete though in that the 11 hours was packed with stuff to do, but I kinda wish games were longer.. they seem to be getting shorter and shorter.\n\n2.  Very linear -- to be expected really.. There is usually only one way to go..\n\n3.  A couple of the levels need more direction -- the car garage sneak event annoyed me and really was the only level that kinda pissed me off, but primarily because I had no idea where I was supposed to go and it took me several tries..\n\n4.  PRODUCT PLACEMENT!!  Dear god..  I wonder how much Cisco and the producers of the new Nightmare on Elm Street paid to get their product so highly and obviously placed in the game..  Frankly this was jarring.. I didn't like this..  All computer monitors can be destroyed!! uh.. unless there is a Cisco logo on it, then no..  etc..  There were others.. it was annoying..\n\n5.  And finally the AI, while not dreadfully stupid the enemy aren't too bright.. For example I was right around the corner from a guy who knew I was there.. he had the brilliant idea of throwing a frag grenade at me.. it basically dropped at his feet and I just remained hidden while he died.. heh  it was amusing, but kinda dumb..   The biggest issue is that they are constantly yelling what they are doing which they took directly from FEAR and was a problem in that game too that I know folks complained about..  Oh well..\n\nAll in all it was a great game.. and I will likely play it again on hard..\n\nI think I actually give this one 4.5 out of 5 stars.\n","previous":{"next":{"path":"_posts/2010-05-01-game-review-splintercell-conviction.md","url":"/game-review-splintercell-conviction/","relative_path":"_posts/2010-05-01-game-review-splintercell-conviction.md","id":"/game-review-splintercell-conviction","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Game Review: Splintercell Conviction","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2010/05/tom_clancys_splinter_cell_conviction-4.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":true,"allow_comments":false,"date":"2010-05-01 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"game-review-splintercell-conviction","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2010-04-30-tron-2-lightcycle.md","output":null,"content":"<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2010/04/troncycle01.jpg\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Tron Lightcycle\" src=\"/images/2010/04/troncycle01-e1272648379482-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Tron Lightcycle\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Tron Lightcycle</span></a>\n\nI want one..\n\nSo I have gone above and beyond out of my way to avoid learning any details about Tron 2..

I have two 40k armies; Tau and Orks.  I like them both and am not really looking to change them..   But right now I only really have one fantasy army;  Skaven.  I love my rats, but I want to find another army to play and have been looking for a while..  I tried Ogre's and I tried Tomb Kings but really didn't get into them.  I have a lot of TK stuff painted up and I very much like the models and the lore, but for whatever reason the TK army just doesn't excite me..  The Ogre's never even got that far..\n\nSo I'm back on the hunt and I think I have settled on getting a Daemons of Chaos list going.\n\nI think all of the models are pretty neat, and I like that that its sorta 4 armies in one; one list for each god.  Something that also appeals on a lesser level is the fact that they are the exact same models used in Fantasy and 40k.. So if you have them ready to go in Fantasy, its easy to use them in 40k.  (Just have to solve the bases problem which I'll get to in a moment.. )\n\nMy number one reason for picking this army is because I dig the models.  I am most likely going to go an all Slaanesh army, or if that's not viable I'll fill in with Nurgle or Khorne..   I'm going to leave Tzeentch out because it seems it's what ever one is doing and I like doing things others aren't..\n\nI really look forward to painting these guys (gals?) up.. I think the Slaanesh models all look pretty cool and should be quite fun to paint.. I know I wont get anywhere near as good results as the professional painters do, but still they look good and should come out okay..\n\nThe only issue at this point is that the new core rule book is coming out in July and is rumored to nurf the Daemons down something harsh..  If the current rumors hold true then the DoC army as a whole may be unplayable.. I find that unfortunate, but not enough to dissuade me from getting the army in the first place..\n\nI have also heard tell that half the reason for the new rule book is to correct issues in the DoC army and a couple other newer armies that introduced issues into the game.. It's really too bad they feel the need to completely rewrite the main rules, instead of just fixing the issue with the individual army..\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2010/04/daemonette.jpg\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"daemonette\" src=\"/images/2010/04/daemonette-e1272512468652-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Fantasy and 40k approved!</span></a>\n\n__The Bases__:  So, I listed above that these models can be used in both fantasy and 40k.. that's pretty cool.. The only issue is that fantasy uses square bases, and 40k uses round bases.  That issue can be complicated further by the fact that 40k bases are one inch in diameter, and fantasy bases are typically 20mm or 25mm square..  So, if you want to use the same models in both games (as opposed to buying the same models twice.. ) then you have to get clever about your bases..\n\nI solved it this way;\n\n1.  I got some washers that are smaller around than both the 40k bases and the fantasy bases you're going to use.  With the Daemonettes I was in luck, they use  25mm bases so I could get a slightly larger washer than if I was stuck with 20mm bases.  Also make sure the washers have as small a center hole as possible.  The washers I'm using are 7/8 (0.87\") with a 7/32 (0.20\") inner hole, got them at Lowes for $3 or $4 for a hand full..\n\n2. I then assembled the model as I wanted it and glued it to the top of one of the washers -- trying very hard not to foul the hole in the washer.\n\n3. I then drilled 4 itty bitty holes in the base and stuck in some of the tiny magnets I have.   I mean it these things are small.. 0.05\" is small man..  4 of them hold the washer down nicely, and are small enough to not cause clustering.. (Where a bunch of magnets jump to one another.. )  Drill all the way through the base with a drill bit slightly smaller than the magnet, and then enlarge it a bit by in and out movements..  This is a tiny hobby drill bit.. Once that's done, I glued the magnets in from the underside so they wont go anywhere.\n\n4. I then got a dowel from Walmarts hobby area that was the exact fit for the washers..  You can get a bag of like 20 of them for $0.89..   I drilled a whole in the direct center of the base and pushed the dowel through.. I had to be very careful not to split the base.. And I made sure to push the down through the hole a bit so that it touches the table the same time the edges of the base does.  It helps with gluing later.\n\n5.  I then took the thinnest washer I had ( they are varying thicknesses for some odd reason ) and slid it down the dowel until to stuck to the magnets..  Put the dowel in a vice, and used a coping saw to cut the dowel at the washer.  Once that was done I applied glue to the underside, again ensuring that nothing goes anywhere.\n\n6.  And that's it..  Paint and flock it up.. When you flock the square base you want to make sure that you use an extra washer because it gets kinda nasty.. And when it dries you might have to do some minor surgery to get that washer off.. I had to carefully Xacto around the edges to free it from its flocky jail..\n\nClick the image to see the results.. it works out nicely..  The 40k round bases snaps up in there and only requires a touch of flocking on the top of the dowel.. the fantasy base you see snaps down nicely too almost 100% hiding the washer..\n","previous":{"next":{"path":"_posts/2010-04-27-daemons-of-chaos.md","url":"/daemons-of-chaos/","relative_path":"_posts/2010-04-27-daemons-of-chaos.md","id":"/daemons-of-chaos","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Games Workshop -- Warhammer: Daemons of Chaos","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2010/04/kos-150x150.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":true,"allow_comments":false,"date":"2010-04-27 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"daemons-of-chaos","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2010-04-19-hardware-review-nook-e-reader.md","output":null,"content":"<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2010/04/nook_angle-view.jpg\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"BN.com Nook\" src=\"/images/2010/04/nook_angle-view-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"BN.com Nook\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>BN.com Nook</span></a>\n\nSo I have been in the market for an e-reader for a while.  I do a lot of reading and thought it would be darn handy to have a single device that could carry multiple books, and have the ability to order new books at any time, anywhere.  I like real paper books, but the ability to carry many books in one small device is appealing.  And despite what my sister in law says, I think they are generally a good idea and can only encourage reading..\n\nEveryone I know swears by the Amazon Kindle, and while the device works just fine I just didn't much like it.  I got my paws on a friends and it felt cheap to me, plus I really didn't like that keyboard down there.. The Kindle DX looked really nice, but it's big and really expensive.. I could have purchased an Apple IPad for the cost..\n\nWhich brings me to my I didn't want an IPad..  Asside from <a href=\"/i-hate-apple-fanboys/\">fanboy snobbery turning me off of Apple</a>, I didn't want an IPad because I wanted a dedicated device for reading that was of a size as to not be unwieldy..   The IPad and the Kindle DX are, for me, too big for comfortable reading.  And the IPad with all its other features would distract me from what I want the device primarily for; reading..  yes I'm actually implying the IPad has too many features.. heh  For an e-reader anyway.. Plus the $500+ price tag is a tad steep..  And the other huge issue is that Apple doesn't give us any sort of window into what books they offer to non-ipad owners..\n\nAnd let's be honest here.. You're buying into a back end -- the hardware really is immaterial..  I have always liked Barns and Nobles and generally go there first when I want a book, so when they announced the Nook I was interested from the start.. BN.com and the BN brick and mortar stores most likely aren't going to go anywhere..  They are the largest chain of bookstores in the United States, and the BN store here in Austin is huge and is always crammed with people buying stuff -- I'm pretty sure they aren't going to go anywhere any time soon..\n\nSo they seem like a good company to offer an e-reader with a solid back end..  Plus their technology seems very solid and well glued together.. I like that I can purchase a book online through their website and it magically appears in my Nook ready to read with in a minute or two..\n\nI also like that if I drop my Nook off the planet, I can simple buy a new one and have all my books still..  yay!  This really is a one stop shop for books in that I will never have to buy the same book ever again..  Plus, I like that I can attach another Nook to the same account so my wife can have access to my library..  Damn handy that..\n\nThe Nook hardware is extremely nice.  It has a good weight to it (being roughly twice the weight of the kindle) and is well built.  I have seen some people complain about cracked plastic around the outside but I have yet to see anything like that in mine and I don't see how its possible without dropping it or throwing it at something..\n\nAnd the best part is that it's built on Android!!  So new updates come all the time..  More over apparently it's extremely easy to root, which I have no intention of ever doing.. this e-reader is always going to be just my e-reader.. nothing more..\n\nComplaints:\n\nI do have a few complaints about the device that are really very minor..\n\n1.  No internal backlight -- In the interest of battery conservation they didn't put a light in the Nook.  Their reasoning was that if it had a light it would chew up the battery very quickly and for some reason people think that if an e-reader can't go a month without charging its not worth owning..  I say F to that.. It's my device if I want to chew up the battery reading a book late at night using the internal back light so I don't wake my wife, then I should be able to..  Give the users the option to use their device how they want to use it..\n\n2.  Slow page turns -- I think this is just the nature of the e-ink screens but they pages are slow to turn.  Now, when I say slow to turn I mean it takes all of a second, maybe a second and a half, once you click \"next page\" for it to actually show up.  This is a minor minor gripe at best, and may be due to some Android programming issue and as such is fixable.. But more likely its due to the e-ink screen just taking that long and I should get over it..\n\n3.  The touch screen kinda sucks -- the little LCD touch screen seems like a good idea but its very unresponsive.. Again I don't know if this is an Android issue that will get resolved or if its a hardware issue but sometimes it just wont respond to input.. Or is very slow to respond..  I'm going to chalk this up to an Android issue that will get ironed out as updates are released..\n\nAnd that's it.. those are my complaints.. All really minor to be sure.. the thing works great.. I'm very happy with the purchase and at this point I have 7 books in there waiting to be read..\n\nI think the problem now will be the growing line of books in my queue waiting to be enjoyed.. Ah what a problem to have..\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2010-04-09-rock-band-to-real-band.md","url":"/rock-band-to-real-band/","relative_path":"_posts/2010-04-09-rock-band-to-real-band.md","id":"/rock-band-to-real-band","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"From Rock Band to Real Band","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2010/04/rock-band-guitar-decal-150x150.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2010-04-09 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"rock-band-to-real-band","ext":".md"},"url":"/hardware-review-nook-e-reader/","relative_path":"_posts/2010-04-19-hardware-review-nook-e-reader.md","id":"/hardware-review-nook-e-reader","collection":"posts","excerpt":"So I have been in the market for an e-reader for a while.  I do a lot of reading and thought it would be darn handy to have a single device that could carry multiple books, and have the ability to order new books at any time, anywhere.","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Hardware Review: Nook e-reader","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2010/04/nook_angle-view.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2010-04-19 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"hardware-review-nook-e-reader","ext":".md"},"url":"/daemons-of-chaos/","relative_path":"_posts/2010-04-27-daemons-of-chaos.md","id":"/daemons-of-chaos","collection":"posts","excerpt":"So I prefer Warhammer Fantasy to 40k..  I just think the rules are better, and the game as a whole has a lot of tactics and strategy to it, where as 40k is written more for the kids to be a fast paced shoot'em'up style game.  I still play 40k, but I prefer fantasy..","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Games Workshop -- Warhammer: Daemons of Chaos","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2010/04/kos-150x150.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":true,"allow_comments":false,"date":"2010-04-27 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"daemons-of-chaos","ext":".md"},"url":"/tron-2-lightcycle/","relative_path":"_posts/2010-04-30-tron-2-lightcycle.md","id":"/tron-2-lightcycle","collection":"posts","excerpt":"I want one..
