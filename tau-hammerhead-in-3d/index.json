Every time I buy something there, it's defective and usually has been opened and returned before.  If someone returns a product for being broken, why do they insist on putting it back out on the floor?!    Does boxing it up some how make it magically work? -  It's over Fry's.  I officially will no longer shop at your stores.\n\nI'd rather have higher prices on products that actually work, rather than deal with your shit..\n\nWhy would you do this?   If customer A buys a $100  joystick, takes it home and tries to use it - only to find out that there is a short in the cord making the joystick unusable - a two part joystick that requires power to both devices is oddly not very useful if one of the devices doesn't get powered - it's perfectly reasonable for him to take it back and get another one.  Probably happens all the time.   When he returns it they always ask what the problem was - why do you ignore it?!\n\nNo no.. just box it back up, maybe some other sucker will buy it..\n\nIn steps me, customer B - as in Boob - who purchases the new joystick blissfully unaware that it had been previously purchased and stuffed back into the box god knows how many times..\n\nFry's USED to put stickers on the box saying that \"this product has been previously opened\".. yeah they don't do that any more..   Now they dress up the box as it was and stick it back on the floor, obviously with out doing ANY checks what so ever..  And not disclosing in any way what so ever that they item you're purchasing as NEW, isn't.\n\nSo when I got home - 55minute drive ONE WAY - and opened my new joystick, the bags and twisties and what not inside were all akimbo and clearly not how the factory would have packed it.    Not a good sign.    My first thought was;  Well shit - this has been previously opened.. even though they sold it to me as if it were new..   Bastards..\n\nAnd guess what.. its broken to boot - completely unusable.  The device had nicks and scratches on the outside of it and the cables had very clear shorts in it.  So now I'm forced to return it - JUST LIKE THE FIRST GUY!\n\nWhy do this Fry's?  All you're doing is pissing off customers..\n\nDo you just count sales?  I mean does this count as 2 sales for you .. whoo hoo... Never mind the fact that it was returned twice so the bottom line is still zero.. no no.. its two sales we can report!  Go us!    is that it?\n\nOr do you expect the customer to troll the rest of the store and buy other things while returning their defective product?  'cause here's a clue..  they don't.  They are pissed off that you have inconvenienced them and forced them to come when they didn't want to.. so the last  thing they want to do is buy something else from you that they probably will just have to return again..\n\nIT'S BAD BUSINESS!  And if it happened only once or twice.. I could forgive that..  Hey people are just human and make mistakes.. woops that one got put back on the shelf by mistake..  but no.. this happens CONSTANTLY at Fry's..  It's got to be part of your store policy or something; \"We only return stuff to the manufacturer if its been returned to the store 10 or more times.. \"\n\nWell guess what - you've lost a customer forever.  Others that I know have also sworn off your crappy store and if you keep this up no one will want to shop there.\n\nThere are quite a few other stores that do what you do - only better.   Your low prices aren't worth the bullshit of having to return everything, and I do mean everything.  With the exception of a pair of memory sticks that I got at Fry's (also had been pre-opened) I have had to return everything because it was defective..  Never again.  I'd rather pay the extra one or two percent and know that the product I got was worth a damn..\n\nToday I will return this joystick and demand a refund, at which point Fry's.. You're dead to me.\n","previous":{"next":{"path":"_posts/2007-01-04-frys-strikes-again.md","url":"/frys-strikes-again/","relative_path":"_posts/2007-01-04-frys-strikes-again.md","id":"/frys-strikes-again","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Fry's strikes again!","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2007-01-04 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"frys-strikes-again","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2006-12-26-tau-hammerhead-in-3d.md","output":null,"content":"<a rel=\"lightbox\" class=\"fancybox\" href=\"/images/2009/05/turret-texture-test-01.jpg\"><img title=\"Turret Texture Test\" src=\"/images/2009/05/turret-texture-test-01-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Turret Texture Test\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Turret Texture Test</span></a>\n\nI frequently troll various 3D forums and just about always come away with a feeling of inadequacy.. There are quite a lot of extremely talented folks in the 3D field, and I often dream of being one.\n\nTonight I have embarked on yet another model making adventure -- an attempt to create a very high quality model that actually looks real. In my search for something to create I chose a known object that is from another one of my hobbies, Warhammer 40k. I have decided to make a <a href=\"http://oz.games-workshop.com/games/40k/tau/extras/wallpaper/images/WP_Hammerhead_1024x768.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Tau Hammerhead</a>.\n\nNote: The image to the right will always be the latest high resolution render.  Click to enlarge.\n\n\n\nMy goal is to make a realistic looking \"plastic model\". Meaning, I want to be able to make this model look very close to the plastic model I have on my desk. Not necessarily make it look \"real\" as in it can really fly and really exists, but rather make it look like its a real plastic model -- If that makes sense.\n\nTo that end I took some high quality photos of my hammerhead (sans gun) with an attempt to get orthographic references that I could use as backdrops.\n\nAnd I will be working in 4 hour blocks on this model, as I dont want my head to explode.\n\nHere is what I have after my first 4 hours - doesn't look like much but its actually extremely accurate and high poly.. heh\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" class=\"fancybox\" title=\"Tau Hammerhead WIP - Step 1\" href=\"/images/2006/12/hh_wip_s01.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"/images/2006/12/hh_wip_s01.thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Tau Hammerhead WIP - Step 1\" height=\"96\" /></a>\n\nAnother 4 Hours - looks nearly the same but I have more than doubled the poly count with details that are just not seen from this angle..\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" class=\"fancybox\" title=\"Tau Hammerhead WIP - Step 2\" href=\"/images/2006/12/hh_wip_s02.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"/images/2006/12/hh_wip_s02.thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Tau Hammerhead WIP - Step 2\" height=\"96\" /></a>\n\n+4 - I went ahead and mirrored the for the render just to give me a sense of what it will look like..

I'm tempted to post in the Luxology WIP forum, but some of those guys are REALLY good.. and I don't want to embarrass myself.. heh Maybe when I get a tad further along.\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" class=\"fancybox\" title=\"Tau Hammerhead WIP - Step 3\" href=\"/images/2006/12/steps1.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"/images/2006/12/steps1.thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Tau Hammerhead WIP - Step 3\" /></a>\n\n+4 - Okay I have been fighting with the nose curve for hours now..

My main render / model machine died the bad death a while back and it has taken me quite sometime to get back up and running..\n\nI'm still roughing out the model at this point, no serious details yet. In the shot below you can see I have loaded the turret, gun and main mesh all into one model and have begun working on the front drone mounts.\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" class=\"fancybox\" title=\"Hammerhead - Step 8\" href=\"/images/2007/05/hh_wip_s08.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"/images/2007/05/hh_wip_s08.thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Hammerhead - Step 8\" /></a>\n+4ish - I didn't time it but I figure its roughly 4 hours.

The latest version of this thing is to the point where I can start trying to texture it..   I have always Suuuucked at texturing so this is a dive off the deep end.. I really really want to get a graphical tablet as you can't take advantage of some of the power of Modo without one.   Here is where I am at right now..\n\n+ 8 hours -- <a  class=\"fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2009/05/engine-texture-test-03.jpg\">Click to see</a> I have continued to texture the model quite a bit and even went so far as to purchase a graphics tablet.. It's Soooooo much easier to texture the model when using a pen!!   Especially considering the modo folks designed the program to use one.  heh  I'm having a lot of fun with this..  The image is a double stack front/back render and is a tad tall to include in the post.. so click the link to see it open in a lightbox in the page.\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" class=\"fancybox\" href=\"/images/2009/05/turret-texture-test-01.jpg\"><img title=\"Turret Texture Test\" src=\"/images/2009/05/turret-texture-test-01-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Turret Texture Test\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Turret Texture Test</span></a>\n\n+ 8 hours -- Well I spent a good chunk of the day completely redoing the turret portion of the hammer head, adding a lot more detail as well as adding textures.  It's not done yet.. I'm slowly using my tablet to add detail to the textures as well as playing with various noise amounts..  Its interesting finding the right balance..\n\nI also spent quite a bit of time with the UV mapping tools to try to hone my UV skills.. One thing I used to be bad about (and still am in some cases) is just using an atlas explosion of the model into a UV.. Done.  I find that it's not a very good method for UV'ing because you get strange artifacts and defects when painting..   You're far better served actually correctly unwrapping the model and then positioning it on the map in order to maximize the available space..   I'm still learning this..\n\nFun stuff.. I'll be adding this part of the mesh to the main model later this week.\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" class=\"fancybox\" href=\"/images/2009/05/currenthighresrender1.jpg\"><img title=\"More Texturing\" src=\"/images/2009/05/currenthighresrender-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"More Texturing\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>More Texturing</span></a>\n\n+ 8 hours -- I have been working on the body of the hammerhead.  I have mostly fixed the nose area which I think was bulbous and ugly previously.  It doesn't perfectly match the actual physical model but at this point its probably as close as I can get it without completely starting over.\n\nI have divided up the various areas into their respective colors and will begin the texturing process once I get the cockpit bump in place on top of the model.\n\nSo yet again it's been a while since I worked on this.. I recently lost my harddrive and thought I lost this model entirely!!! Which lets be honest would have made me cry a little..  Lucky for me one of my coworkers managed to save the model off the drive for me and I have now backed it up to a raid 5 nas.. So shouldn't happen again..\n\nI am getting pretty close to being done with this model I think..  The back door, the landing gear and the chin turret still need to be completed but once that's done I think I'll count it done and stop working on it.\n\nOver all I'm fairly happy with it but you can really tell as you look at the mesh that I didn't know what I was doing in quite a few areas..\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2006-12-23-polyester-resin-pens.md","url":"/polyester-resin-pens/","relative_path":"_posts/2006-12-23-polyester-resin-pens.md","id":"/polyester-resin-pens","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Hobbies"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Polyester Resin Pens","layout":"post","tags":["Wood Turning","Wood Working"],"image":"/images/2006/12/pen08.jpg","ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2006-12-23 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"polyester-resin-pens","ext":".md"},"url":"/tau-hammerhead-in-3d/","relative_path":"_posts/2006-12-26-tau-hammerhead-in-3d.md","id":"/tau-hammerhead-in-3d","collection":"posts","excerpt":"<p><a rel=\"lightbox\" class=\"fancybox\" href=\"/images/2009/05/turret-texture-test-01.jpg\"><img title=\"Turret Texture Test\" src=\"/images/2009/05/turret-texture-test-01-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Turret Texture Test\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Turret Texture Test</span></a></p>\n","draft":false,"categories":["Hobbies"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Tau Hammerhead in 3D","layout":"post","tags":["3D Graphics","Tank"],"image":"/images/2009/05/currenthighresrender1.jpg","ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2006-12-26 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"tau-hammerhead-in-3d","ext":".md"},"url":"/frys-strikes-again/","relative_path":"_posts/2007-01-04-frys-strikes-again.md","id":"/frys-strikes-again","collection":"posts","excerpt":"I'd rather have higher prices on products that actually work, rather than deal with your shit Fry's..","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Fry's strikes again!","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2007-01-04 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"frys-strikes-again","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2006-12-26-tau-hammerhead-in-3d.md","output":null,"content":"<a rel=\"lightbox\" class=\"fancybox\" href=\"/images/2009/05/turret-texture-test-01.jpg\"><img title=\"Turret Texture Test\" src=\"/images/2009/05/turret-texture-test-01-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Turret Texture Test\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Turret Texture Test</span></a>\n\nI frequently troll various 3D forums and just about always come away with a feeling of inadequacy..

I'm slowly using my tablet to add detail to the textures as well as playing with various noise amounts..  Its interesting finding the right balance..\n\nI also spent quite a bit of time with the UV mapping tools to try to hone my UV skills.. One thing I used to be bad about (and still am in some cases) is just using an atlas explosion of the model into a UV.. Done.  I find that it's not a very good method for UV'ing because you get strange artifacts and defects when painting..   You're far better served actually correctly unwrapping the model and then positioning it on the map in order to maximize the available space..   I'm still learning this..\n\nFun stuff..

So shouldn't happen again..\n\nI am getting pretty close to being done with this model I think..  The back door, the landing gear and the chin turret still need to be completed but once that's done I think I'll count it done and stop working on it.\n\nOver all I'm fairly happy with it but you can really tell as you look at the mesh that I didn't know what I was doing in quite a few areas..\n","previous":{"next":{"next":{"path":"_posts/2007-01-04-frys-strikes-again.md","url":"/frys-strikes-again/","relative_path":"_posts/2007-01-04-frys-strikes-again.md","id":"/frys-strikes-again","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Fry's strikes again!","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2007-01-04 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"frys-strikes-again","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2006-12-26-tau-hammerhead-in-3d.md","output":null,"content":"<a rel=\"lightbox\" class=\"fancybox\" href=\"/images/2009/05/turret-texture-test-01.jpg\"><img title=\"Turret Texture Test\" src=\"/images/2009/05/turret-texture-test-01-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Turret Texture Test\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Turret Texture Test</span></a>\n\nI frequently troll various 3D forums and just about always come away with a feeling of inadequacy.. There are quite a lot of extremely talented folks in the 3D field, and I often dream of being one.\n\nTonight I have embarked on yet another model making adventure -- an attempt to create a very high quality model that actually looks real. In my search for something to create I chose a known object that is from another one of my hobbies, Warhammer 40k. I have decided to make a <a href=\"http://oz.games-workshop.com/games/40k/tau/extras/wallpaper/images/WP_Hammerhead_1024x768.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Tau Hammerhead</a>.\n\nNote: The image to the right will always be the latest high resolution render.  Click to enlarge.\n\n\n\nMy goal is to make a realistic looking \"plastic model\". Meaning, I want to be able to make this model look very close to the plastic model I have on my desk. Not necessarily make it look \"real\" as in it can really fly and really exists, but rather make it look like its a real plastic model -- If that makes sense.\n\nTo that end I took some high quality photos of my hammerhead (sans gun) with an attempt to get orthographic references that I could use as backdrops.\n\nAnd I will be working in 4 hour blocks on this model, as I dont want my head to explode.\n\nHere is what I have after my first 4 hours - doesn't look like much but its actually extremely accurate and high poly.. heh\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" class=\"fancybox\" title=\"Tau Hammerhead WIP - Step 1\" href=\"/images/2006/12/hh_wip_s01.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"/images/2006/12/hh_wip_s01.thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Tau Hammerhead WIP - Step 1\" height=\"96\" /></a>\n\nAnother 4 Hours - looks nearly the same but I have more than doubled the poly count with details that are just not seen from this angle..\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" class=\"fancybox\" title=\"Tau Hammerhead WIP - Step 2\" href=\"/images/2006/12/hh_wip_s02.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"/images/2006/12/hh_wip_s02.thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Tau Hammerhead WIP - Step 2\" height=\"96\" /></a>\n\n+4 - I went ahead and mirrored the for the render just to give me a sense of what it will look like.. I'm very happy. I spent the majority of this 4 hour block cleaning up ugly non-planer polys. Thanks to some helpful advice over at the <a title=\"Non-planer poly discussion\" href=\"http://forums.luxology.com/discussion/topic.aspx?id=13987\" target=\"_blank\">Luxology Forums</a> regarding ways to deal with non-planer polygons.\n\nI think I have most of them under control, though I still would like a single tool that averages across multple vertices.. I'm tempted to post in the Luxology WIP forum, but some of those guys are REALLY good.. and I don't want to embarrass myself.. heh Maybe when I get a tad further along.\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" class=\"fancybox\" title=\"Tau Hammerhead WIP - Step 3\" href=\"/images/2006/12/steps1.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"/images/2006/12/steps1.thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Tau Hammerhead WIP - Step 3\" /></a>\n\n+4 - Okay I have been fighting with the nose curve for hours now.. It took me forever to get it \"right\" and I still think its a tad off.. But this is as close as I can get it.. The nose area needs a lot of work, but for a roughed out version this isn't terrible.\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" class=\"fancybox\" title=\"Tau Hammerhead WIP - Step 4\" href=\"/images/2006/12/step4.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"/images/2006/12/step4.thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Tau Hammerhead WIP - Step 4\" /></a>\n\n+4 - It actually took me every bit of this 4 hours to get the nose curves to work the way I wanted them to. At this point I call it \"better\", but not yet to the point I want it.. It just still looks off to me.

My main render / model machine died the bad death a while back and it has taken me quite sometime to get back up and running..\n\nI'm still roughing out the model at this point, no serious details yet.

Wood turning is a lot of fun and you can create some very pretty pens if you take the time. Here is an example of one I made - click for full image;\n\nIt's a fun hobby and I enjoy it - it allows me to be creative on a completely different level than anything a computer could ever give me (Unless I managed to turn one out of wood).\n\nA week or two ago my father sent me a PDF about making pens from a polyester resin. Basically instead of using a \"blank\" of wood as seen in the picture above, I would use a blank of this hardened resin. Well add to that the fact that I would actually be making the blank from scratch and my interest was piqued..\n\nWhat's amazing is how easy it is. You just have to buy the resin and colorants!, mix them up.. let it set.. zing! You're done. Oh I'm sorry did you expect it to be hard? It wasn't.\nHere's basically what I did:\n\n* Buy a 1 gallon jug of polyester resin and the catalyst hardener.\n* Buy some colloRants! to mix into the resin before it sets .\n* Find a roughly blank sized mold, in this case I used a ziplock container\n* Fill it with water to find out how many oz. it is. (it was 14) Pour out the water.\n* Fill the mold with the resin and put in 7 drops of the catalyst for ever ounce of resin.\n* Stir.\n* Stir some more.\n* More stirring please..\n* ... More cowbell! er.. stirring! for about two minutes actually.\n* Now grab some of the colorant powder and mix it in. I used 4 big scoops, I should have used 6.\n* Once the colorant is stirred in and you see the pretty swirls.. walk away man..\n* Go have a coke and a smile.\n\nThat's pretty much it. It took probably 15 minutes for the liquid resin to go into a gel state.. about 1 minute for it to go from a gel to a rubbery solid and maybe an hour for it to completely set. It got extremely hot too - gotta love that chemical reaction.\n\nI then cut a couple blanks and tried my hand at making a pen out of it. Here is what I got - click for full sized image;\n<a class=\"fancybox pull-left\" title=\"Polyester Resin\" href=\"/images/2006/12/pen09.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\"><src=\"/images/2006/12/pen09.thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Polyester Resin\" width=\"128\" height=\"96\" /></a>\nIt's not perfect. I clearly didnt add enough colorant because you can see through to the brass tube where the resin gets thin.. so mental note: add a touch more next time. But really I'm very happy with the results.\n\nThis stuff is easy to work with and it's much less expensive than wood. I have a feeling I will be making a lot of resin pens.\n","previous":{"next":{"path":"_posts/2006-12-23-polyester-resin-pens.md","url":"/polyester-resin-pens/","relative_path":"_posts/2006-12-23-polyester-resin-pens.md","id":"/polyester-resin-pens","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Hobbies"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Polyester Resin Pens","layout":"post","tags":["Wood Turning","Wood Working"],"image":"/images/2006/12/pen08.jpg","ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2006-12-23 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"polyester-resin-pens","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2006-12-21-programming-and-me.md","output":null,"content":"Programming has always been a hobby of mine. I first started programming on the Commodore Vic-20 in 1983 after my father and I went to a \"listen to our schpeal and get something for free\" dinner; where we told them to take a hike and they gave us a Commodore Vic-20 as a thanks for coming gift. That was back in the days of hand assembling 6502 opcodes and calculating branch offsets in my head.. And I wonder why I'm brain damaged..\n\nI eventually splurged and purchased a Commodore 64 and was off to the races. I suddenly went from having 3.5k of programmable space to nearly 39k of programmable space!! WOW! That's programming space for days!  It was a lot of fun learning to write on the C=64. I could make that computer do anything. To this day I think I knew more about the C=64 than I have ever known about any computer. I literally could make that machine do anything, and did at every turn.\n\nAfter a while the C=64 got old and I eventually really splurged and purchased an Amiga 500. I didn't do nearly as much programming on this machine as I did on the C=64, and I think that's mainly because I was suddenly thrust into a very foreign environment and didn't fully recover. My programming skills slipped a lot while I owned the Amiga. I did do a lot of basic programming, but nothing on the level of what I did on the C=64 or Vic-20.\n\nWhile I owned the Amiga's I was more interested in 3D graphics and thus started my love affair with NewTek's Lightwave 3D, but that's a story for another article.\n\nI still owned my Amiga 500 (and then an Amiga 1200) until I went to Korea, thanks to the US Army, in 1993. Up to that point I had resisted getting an IBM / IBM Compatible PC like all my friends, in favor of the Amiga system. The Army pretty much changed that.. While in Korea I worked with many IBM compatible machines as well as various other OS machines of every kind. That experience pushed me to purchase my first IBM machine. It was a 486DX 100 machine. And of course, with my extensive programming background, what was the first thing I wanted to do? well.. play games of course.. but the second thing was learn to program it..\n\nI immediately started shopping around for a language that I could use to make the computer sing. And I tried them all. I was very dissatisfied with the majority of them.. And yet again with my desire to program fading (due to lack of an inspiring language) my skills faded as well. .. back to playing games.\n\nIn 1995 I was stationed in Washington and I was bored. The job satisfaction there was the pits so I needed something to do in my spare time that would take my mind of the dull drudgery that I had enlisted for. I went to the computer store one day bound and determined to find a programming language that would be powerful and yet functional and good in every way. I was feeling somewhat anti-Microsoft at the time so visual basic 3.0 was not something I wanted to use. Plus I didn't like that you had to have runtime libraries in order to run their tokenized code. (Not even true compiled code..sheesh)\n\nAs I strolled through CompUSA I found a copy of Delphi 1.0 on the shelf between Visual Basic (Microsoft) and C++ (Microsoft). Delphi, a programming language developed by Borland is a descendant of Turbo Pascal but with a new visual wrapper. Basically it's Borland's answer to Microsoft's Visual Basic, It's Visual Pascal. I was intrigued enough to purchase it on the spot without even doing any research. And it was one of the best splurge purchases I have ever made. I'm very happy with it.\n\nSo that's the basic story of how I cam to be a Delphi programmer. And I have tried other software packages.. I have programming environments for C++, C#, Delphi.. etc.. I have books on just about every language you care to mention.. but I always find myself coming back to Delphi.\n\nAt this point, when it comes to standard applications, I will always use Delphi. There is just no reason for me to use anything else. Delphi excels at rapidly creating desktop programs.\n\nI'm also trying to learn C++ so that I may take an even more serious step into the world of programming. I want to create games, and that's typically not something one does in Delphi. While it is possible in Delphi, it really wasn't intended for that use.\n\nAt this point in my life it has been a while since I have done any kind of work with Delphi or any other compiled languages,  the majority of the programming work I do is in the realm of web languages.\n\nHowever, a new project has emerged that is right up my ally and promises to be fun and exciting.  And it comes with the added bonus of introducing me to a completely new language.  LISP!  Now.. Lisp is not a new language by any stretch of the meaning, but its new to me.  I know virtually nothing about lisp, and from what I have seen of it, it's not like any other language I have every used.  But it should be good.  Wish me luck on that, I'll post more about it when I get somewhere.. (or if you never hear from me on the subject again then you know the outcome)\n\n##Web Programming\n\nMost \"real\" programmers frown or scoff at web developers calling themselves programmers. Let's face it, anyone can create a webpage. Add to that, the fact that there are quite a few WYSIWYG editors for web development, and the number of people who call themselves \"web programmers\" can sky rocket.\n\nBut that's not me. I'm a paid and professional web developer. I'm also a web programmer in that I don't just design and implement static web pages, but rather create rich dynamic sites with robust back end infrastructures. I do more than just crop/cut up photoshop files and create an html file.\n\nIt actually offends me a little that I am straddled with the same \"title\" as those others who know virtually nothing.  I have taken to calling my self a software engineer simply to avoid the stigma.\n\nI consider myself to be an expert, or at the least highly skilled, in the creation of rich web applications and the use of Ajax, PHP, XHTML, Javascript, CSS, DOM and I'm fairly good at PERL.\n\nI have worked for many large and small companies as a back end and front end developer. Due to contractual agreements I wont list all of them here, but here are a few of the more recent ones that I can list:\n\n* __C3 Communications__ - I was the highest ranking web monkey in the shop. (a shop of one)\n* __Austin Independent School District__ - I did everything here, from ordering the machines to writing the code.\n* __The Austin American Statesman__ - One of a handful of web monkies, but the only on site PHP developer.\n* __Hoovers Online__ - A D&amp;B company that maintained a staff of 8 to 10 full time PHP developers that wrote the functionality of every aspect of the site. This was an awesome place to work - alas it was a short contract.\n* __BuildForge Inc.__ - An up and coming company that provides a tool used by many major programming shops around the world, I am one of 2 full time PHP5 developers. We do nothing but hard core OOP-PHP5 and we got to build it from the ground up - really a dream project.\n* __IBM__ - Buildforge was purchased by IBM, after which I became the Sr. UI Developer for the Build Forge project at IBM - making me an IBM Software Engineer.  There are now 3 fully time PHP developers working around me and its awesome.\n\nPlus whatever other stuff you can find on this website. I enjoy creating functionality that I need and making it available to the masses where possible.\n\nProgramming is a fun hobby and can be very rewarding, but you have to kind of be brain damaged to like it at any serious level.\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2006-12-21-my-cats-diary.md","url":"/my-cats-diary/","relative_path":"_posts/2006-12-21-my-cats-diary.md","id":"/my-cats-diary","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Comedy"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"My Cats Diary","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2006/12/deadmancat.jpg","ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2006-12-21 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"my-cats-diary","ext":".md"},"url":"/programming-and-me/","relative_path":"_posts/2006-12-21-programming-and-me.md","id":"/programming-and-me","collection":"posts","excerpt":"I first started programming on the Commodore Vic-20..
