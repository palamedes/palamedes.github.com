In CoD4, its used as an anti-personnel mine, as it should be.. but it has a minuscule range, and isn't very powerful.  If they wanted a small anti-personnel mine thats fine, but why besmirch the good name of the Claymore?\n\nEverything I have seen about the Claymore mine in modern day media is likely convincing kids all over the world that the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claymore_mine\" target=\"_blank\">M18A1 Claymore Mine</a> has 2 little lasers that shoot out to represent its firing arc, that all of them are self detonating and that right behind the claymore is a perfectly safe place to be -- wrong..\n\nWhile there are some mines that can be triggered by the mine itself, the vast majority of them are fired by an individual using the clacker (or rather, the M57 firing device.)   And they are absolutely devastating when they go off.\n\nWhile in the US Army, I got to see a Claymore mine detonated in person.  It was one of those US Weapons demonstrations that they do in basic training to get the soldiers pumped up, and let me tell ya -- the Claymore was damn impressive.   The drill sergeants had setup human silhouettes all around the claymore, front and back.  Those in front were about 150 feet away and those in back were about 50 feet away.\n\nWhen the drill finally pushed the plunger, the world moved.   A massive explosion took place and a huge cloud of dust and debris rained down..  The drill came walking up with a huge shit-eating grin and once the smoke cleared ALL of the silhouettes were gone.     We got to see them after wards too, no one would have lived.  Thats when it became clear to me that the Claymore mine was NOT compatible with life..\n\nThe Claymore mine fires 700 1/6th inch steel balls and uses the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misznay-Schardin_effect\" target=\"_blank\">Misznay-Schardin Effect</a> to spray those balls outward in a 60 degree arc in front of the mine. (Thus the iconic, \"FRONT TOWARDS ENEMY\").    Within that 60 degree arc it has an effective range of 65 to 100 feet, out of that 60 degree arc the range is less, but the mine is still quite effective and you're gonna have a bad day if you're closer to it than 50 feet.  I mean think about it, it has almost a full pound of c-4 explosive in it;  that will ruin anyones day.\n\nIn 1954 Picatinny Arsenal issued criteria that the claymore mine had to meet, they were as follows;\n\n* Must weigh less than 3 pounds.\n* Must throw enough fragments so that at a range of 55 yards (50 meters) it achieves a 100 percent strike rate on a 1.3 square feet target (in other words, it always must hit a person at 55 yards)\n* Fragment area must not be more than 8 feet high and no more than 60 degrees\n* Fragments must have a velocity of 4,000 feet per second of kinetic energy delivered to the target.\n\nThis means that if you're closer than 55 yards you're going to be hit by at least one if not more steel balls traveling at 3500+ feet per second..  That's just awful..  Not bad for a device that costs less than $200 each.\n\nI think it seriously down plays the effectiveness and devastation that a Claymore mine can put out when some game says it only has a range of 3 or 4 virtual feet and, oh you can live through it, and oh its safe to lay down behind it..\n\nYou can't live through it, they have a good long range, and it only takes one of those 700 ball bearings to kill you.\n\nYou certainly can't lay down behind it and be safe .. On the front it says \"FRONT TOWARDS ENEMY\", and on the back it says \"GET THE FUCK AWAY!!\".. er.. okay it just says \"BACK\", but maybe it should say more..\n","collection":"posts","url":"/front-towards-enemy/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2008-05-14-front-towards-enemy.md","collection":"posts","url":"/front-towards-enemy/","path":"_posts/2008-05-14-front-towards-enemy.md","id":"/front-towards-enemy","draft":false,"categories":["Games","Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Front Towards Enemy!","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2008/06/claymore.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-05-14 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"front-towards-enemy","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2008-05-18-by-crom-its-age-of-conan.md","content":"<img class=\"pull-right\" title=\"Age of Conan\" src=\"/images/2008/06/age_of_conan_cover-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" />\n\nIt's interesting..

A) You're retarded -- the game isn't out yet.  That happens on the 20th in the US and the 23rd in Europe (Sucks.. sorry about that guys)..  B) this has been the cleanest deployment I've ever seen and I have played a lot of games of this nature.\n\nI think funcom has done a very good job.  Now I'll admit there is still ample time for them to screw it up between now and release, but so far so good.\n\n__Major game issues__:\n\n* In the 14 or so hours total that I have played the game at this point, I have only had one blue screen of death.  The game was running smoothly then the sound locks up, BSoD and auto-reboot.  No idea why it happened.  *shrug*  Could have been anything, so I am not even sure if it was the game.  It could have just as easily been the Microsoft auto updater which has caused me issues before and was demanding I install something upon reboot.\n\n__Minor game issues__:\n\n* After 8 hours of game play my frame rate tanked -- which of course just required me to re-log and all was well.  I class this as a minor issue because there was an easy fix.  Most likely it was a memory leak issue somewhere..\n* Climbing interface needs work -- you just kind of pop onto a ladder and then pop off of it.  Plus if you have multiple climbable surfaces near one another the game often gets confused as to which one you actually want to climb.\n* Mob AI is kinda weak -- when sneaking through the keep to steal the phoenix medallion often you must dispatch some troublesome guards.  Typically I wait for one to be alone, then kill him.  Wait for the next one to path along, then kill him.  Etc..  It amuses me that often one mob will path over the body of his fallen comrade without a care in the world.  I expect this behavour out of unintelligent mobs.. but not guards..\n* Grouping Colors -- by default player names are turned off..  To include those in your group!  I want to be able to see my group mates easily and can't do that in a pack of mobs.  Give us an option to show just our group mate names and make the icons for group members bigger on the mini map please.\n* First Person Shooting -- why does it take me from first person shooting to an over the shoulder view then back after combat?  this confuses me.. and frankly I hate it.\n* Range First/Third Person difference -- why does my bow have a different range depending on my view?  that's retarded.\n\nRequests:\n\n* I want a way to set a view preset for each of my weapon sets.  You have two weapon sets that you can swap between, I want my view to be able to swap too!  First person for bows, third person for swords.  Should be simple.\n* My bows range should be the same no matter what view I'm in.  Its really lame that they are different.  Both third person and first person should work as first person currently does.  If I miss, then I miss.  Don't tell me I'm out of range though.. thats really dumb.\n\nmore as I think of them...\n","collection":"posts","url":"/by-crom-its-age-of-conan/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2008-06-02-its-been-a-year-already.md","collection":"posts","url":"/its-been-a-year-already/","path":"_posts/2008-06-02-its-been-a-year-already.md","id":"/its-been-a-year-already","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"It's been a year already?!","layout":"post","tags":["Marriage"],"image":"/images/2008/06/samecards.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-06-02 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"its-been-a-year-already","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2008-05-18-by-crom-its-age-of-conan.md","excerpt":"It's interesting..

A whole year has gone by in the blink of an eye! It must be magic, cause it really went by fast and everything is still peachy.. More over, for our anniversary gifts to one another we both managed to get the same card, from different stores.. in different cities.. heh\n\nEither we are perfect for one another or both of these stores need a better stock of cards.. heh Considering the vast number that were at my store, I choose the \"we are perfect for one another\" option.\n\nFor our anniversary I got her dough nuts, and we had fishsticks.. Er.. okay kidding about the fishsticks.. Not the dough nuts.. heh.. It's sort of an inside joke, but the long and short of it is; we stayed up until 4am and I got up at 7am and got her her favorite dough nuts.. I was punch drink and woosey while driving the 30 minutes to and from the store..\n\nFor dinner we went to <a href=\"http://www.fogodechao.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Fogo de Chão</a> (fo-go dèe shoun) in downtown Austin.. This restaurant is fantastic! They stuff you full of meat, and then when you cant possibly hold any more, they shove in an extra hand full and call it \"dessert\". Seriously, the chef's walk around with large spits of meat and cut you off a slice as they walk by. It was great! Pricey as all hell, but damn good.\n\n<a title=\"Cheese Cake and Flan\" rel='lightbox' href='/images/2008/06/cheesecakeandflan.jpg' class='fancybox pull-left'><img src=\"/images/2008/06/cheesecakeandflan-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Cheese Cake and Flan\" /></a>\n\nAnd, whats more .. even with as much beef, lamb, chicken, and .. god any other animal you care to mention in our stomach's my lovely and skinny wife still managed to skoff down some cheesecake! I had the flan.. =) it was yummy.\n\nAfterwards Mel and I both had meat hangovers for a couple days.. heh\n","collection":"posts","url":"/its-been-a-year-already/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2008-06-02-its-been-a-year-already.md","collection":"posts","url":"/its-been-a-year-already/","path":"_posts/2008-06-02-its-been-a-year-already.md","id":"/its-been-a-year-already","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"It's been a year already?!","layout":"post","tags":["Marriage"],"image":"/images/2008/06/samecards.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-06-02 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"its-been-a-year-already","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2008-06-12-3g-iphone.md","content":"<img class=\"pull-right\" title=\"3G Iphone\" src=\"/images/2008/06/3giphone-150x150.png\" alt=\"3G Iphone Hotness\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" />\n\nThere is no two ways about it, <a title=\"Wikipedia Link\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_jobs\" target=\"_blank\">Steve Jobs</a> is a pretty smart fellow, and the latest iPhone hotness just proves it.\n\nLets be completely honest here, the hardware upgrades aren't that great though.  I mean its an improvement, but its not a super vast improvement..  The 2 major things the new hardware brings to the table are 3G networking, and GPS.  Both of which for me mean very little.\n\nMy current iPhone's 2G networking works great for me.  I mean so what if it takes 60 seconds to load a webpage instead of 30 seconds.. (Or 59 to 23 or whatever it was.. )  I just don't mind waiting that couple extra seconds.. its not that big of a deal.\n\nThe GPS sounds like a fun little toy, but to be honest once again, I don't see the value of GPS in a phone.  I have no need of that tool.  The location system now is ample -- maybe I would change my story once I got to play with one that was fully GPS enabled, but right now it seems like an extra battery drainer that has no real value.  If you were out in the woods, and needed a GPS antenna, you'd likely get a REAL GPS device that gives true coordinates.. etc..\n\nNow having said that, they are lowing the price of the hardware to $199..  Wow... just.. Wow..  okay that's awesome.. in fact that's not awesome, that's nuts!  Clearly they are taking a loss on this device.. they must be!  I'd be interested it knowing what the cost to Apple is for a single iPhone.  I bet its pretty high.\n\nSome folks are saying that its a complete slap in the face of those folks who have already purchased an iphone at the much higher price, but I don't see it that way.  I mean if you go buy a car, computer or any other kit of hardware you KNOW its going to be worth less the instant you get it.  You should expect it.  Maybe having it thrust in your face as harshly as this is the issue, but I just don't see it that way.\n\nThe $400 for our iphones probably went a long way towards making the $200 iphone even possible.  Had the $400 iphone been a flop, you wouldn't see the cheaper version today.\n\nWhat I'm really looking forward to is the software upgrades..  The application store looks fantastic beyond all reason.  I love it!  I really want to not only download software, but create software that others can use..  In Apples most recent keynote speech they had a demo of some software by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typepad\" target=\"_blank\">typePad</a> -- a competitor to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordpress\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress</a> -- that allows users to create blog entries on the fly.  It looked great and I'd love to try to make one for WP!\n\nThey are also adding a lot of enterprise support which to me makes it pretty clear that Steve Jobs and Apple are extremely keen on cutting the legs out from under <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_In_Motion\" target=\"_blank\">Research in Motion</a> and their blackberry.   Smart.\n\nThere is a lot of money there, and I think they can do it.  The iphone is the latest cool wizbang hotness that I think could easily be on top in a year.\n\nMore over, with the price point of $200 I bet you're going to see a lot of customers using the iphone as a computer for devices.  Think about robots, car computers, or just fun tech toys.  Here you have an extremely small BSD device with phone, wi-fi, bluetooth, camera, gps..etc.. I mean its the perfect device for .. uh.. anything.\n\nThe next year for the iphone should be damn fun to watch!\n","collection":"posts","url":"/3g-iphone/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2008-06-13-mass-effect.md","collection":"posts","url":"/mass-effect/","path":"_posts/2008-06-13-mass-effect.md","id":"/mass-effect","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Mass Effect","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2008/06/256px-masseffect_box_cover-150x150.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-06-13 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"mass-effect","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2008-06-12-3g-iphone.md","excerpt":"There is no two ways about it, Steve Jobs is a pretty smart fellow, and the latest iPhone hotness just proves it.","id":"/3g-iphone","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"3G iPhone","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2008/06/3giphone.png","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-06-12 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"3g-iphone","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2008-06-02-its-been-a-year-already.md","excerpt":"So I can't believe I have been married for a year already!
