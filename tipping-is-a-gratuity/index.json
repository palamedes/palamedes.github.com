Typically I try to make something bigger than is really realistic for my skills.  Some grandiose scheme that is so massive even a dedicated company with money to spare would scoff at it's vastness, little alone a single person with marginal programming skills.\n\nSo, in thinking about what those skills are and trying to keep a game within that vein; I have been considering a browser based <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4X\">4X game</a> done like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_orion\">Masters of Orion</a> or <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.freeorion.org/index.php/Main_Page\">FreeOrion</a> (come on guys, I'm rooting for ya!).  More over, I'd like to make this a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMO\">MMO</a> style game in that you're not alone in the universe.\n\nThe rest of this post is me thinking out loud -- take it with a grain of salt.\n\nThis would all revolve around a web service which would host the games.  There would be many different games running at once. This would allow players to join as many games as they like. These games are independent of each other and give the player something to do while waiting for a turn to end in a different game.  This also allows for the division of ability such that you can have a beginner game, and an expert game..etc.\nEach game would be a browser based massively multiplayer online turn based (or real time) game (BBMMOTBG?! Say that three times fast) where you struggle to conquer the universe.\n\n-Basic Gameplay-\n\nThe basic game play flow would be probably pretty close to what you're thinking when you think of Masters of Orion.  You start in a random location in a universe with a bunch of other star systems which in turn have planets and other objects..etc.  In fact this will pretty much be a clone of MoO or FreeOrion but in a browser - thus leaving the core of the game design already done. We can of course expand from that but the basic game play is the same.\nIn short; You move from one system to the next exploring and trying to reveal the map.  This is how you find other races/beings/npcs/pcs..whatever. All the while expanding your territory and technology such that you can deal with new found \"threats\" (cause everyone else is a threat). You also must gain new resources and protect them from others who are trying to exterminate you, while you kill them.  Sounds like fun.\n\n-Real Time or Turn Based?-\n\nThis is a tough decision and to be completely honest, I can see it going either way right now.  Real time is trickier and presents more issues, however both game models will have their own hurdles.\n\nThe major issues as I see them are thus;\n\nReal Time Game Issues:\n\n* A real time game typically goes to the person who is playing the most.  The instant that someone logs off to go eat, or sleep is when everyone else will pounce.\n* There will be some technical issues with displaying things in real time to browsers however I feel these can easily be solved with either Flash or Ajax.  (I lean towards ajax)\n\nTurn Based Game Issues:\n\n* By its very nature, a turn based game will be slow. Players will very quickly become bored while waiting for the turn to advance so they can go again.\n* Must give the players something else to do while waiting for the turn to advance.. maybe some realtime mini-games?\n\nRight now I'm leaning towards turn based on the major games and maybe offering a realtime game for smaller matches. It shouldn't be too hard to offer both actually.\n\n<u>Home World or Mothership?</u>\n\nOne argument against this style of game play is that anyone who logs off or who isn't actively playing 24 hours a day, is a target.  I'd like to figure out a way where by someones home world is basically impossible to take or maybe give them a mother ship instead of a home world where they can keep moving all the time.  The mother ship would only be in the game while the player is actively playing the game.  If they log out, the mother ship provides a mechanic through you can say they went into warp or some such..\n\nI personally like the idea of a home world that is near impossible to destroy.  Its not super useful other than it is your starting point.  It gives its own resources but very few.  The idea being if a player is beaten back to a home world they could still in time create new ships and what not to move out.  If someone does finally destroy your home world, then you're out of the game and rightly so as it's very hard to do.\n\nThe mother ship idea while having some merit, tends to prolong the game and encourages attacks from behind or out of nowhere.  Plus if you're doing poorly or you're directly under attack you could just log out, which would remove your mother ship from the world until the other person is gone at which point you just log back in.. Basically making you unkillable.  I think this would annoy players.\n\nAt this time, you start the game with a Home World.\n\n<u>Restarts or forever persistent?\n</u>\n\nThe ultimate goal of the game is to take over the universe and exterminate the other players and NPC's.  In some games that follow a similar model, it gets to the point where a new player simply can not compete with the current top player.  Thus they usually come a point in a game when someone has \"won\".  Meaning, if you follow that model the games would only last for so long before you would have to restart everything and even the playing field all over again.\n\nRestart Pros - Persistent Cons:\n\n* Fresh playing field every x number of days\n* All players start over with the same possibility of winning the next game\n* New players that log in to play aren't instantly trounced which means they have a chance\n* Easy to maintain metrics that would allow us to rank players from one game to the next\n* Resources can start over on a completely new / random playing field.\n* The universe can stay smaller because you know that it will start again fresh eventually\n\nRestart Cons - Persistent Pros:\n\n* Restart kills the sense of accomplishment over the long term unless we give them some added character benefits that travel with them from one game to the next\n* Persistent has sense of accomplishment, but only for those who are winning.\n\nI think its a pretty good argument for a game system that only lasts X number of turns or Y number of days.. whatever, then restart.\n\nAt this time, the game will restart every so often.\n\n-Start mid game?-\n\nPlayers should be allowed to start mid-game.  The whole point behind having multiple games running all at once is to give players as much opportunity to play as possible.  So while they are waiting for their \"main game\" to advance, they can log into an already running game and start fresh.  So long as there is an unexplored/unclaimed system still on the map, a new player may join the campaign.\n\nTurn lengths and Turns in general-\n\nEach turn would be made every X amount of time, or in the event that everyone has clicked the \"end turn\" button, instantly.  Most likely you would make turns happen ever 10 minutes or so.   This gives you ample time to get up and walk away from it and come back to it later.  Plus even if you're gone for an hour, you've missed a whole 6 turns.. Woopie..\n\nThe down side to this is it makes the game VERY slow.  We need to try to avoid the slowness.  I'm not too sure how to deal with this in a turn based game.  If there are only 2 players logged in, and both have ended their turn you can go ahead and progress the game a turn.  But if there are 100 players actively playing you can't advance the turn until either the time is up, or the players have ALL gone.\n\nYou only have to worry about those players that are logged in as players that aren't logged in aren't there to do anything anyway.\n\nThat also brings up the ability to allow players to do some minor scripting in the event of things..  Allowing players to do basic stuff via a script or some other management system for when they are off line would be nice..\n\nIn the beginning turns should happen in a fixed amount of time, or in real time.\n\nMore as I ponder it... Stay tuned.\n","collection":"posts","url":"/webbased-4x-game-in-the-moo-vein/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2007-03-22-webbased-4x-game-in-the-moo-vein.md","collection":"posts","url":"/webbased-4x-game-in-the-moo-vein/","path":"_posts/2007-03-22-webbased-4x-game-in-the-moo-vein.md","id":"/webbased-4x-game-in-the-moo-vein","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Webbased 4X game in the MoO vein","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2007-03-22 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"webbased-4x-game-in-the-moo-vein","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2007-04-10-tipping-is-a-gratuity.md","content":"I really hate how in America today, and most likely the world wide, tipping is required.

I'll do that.. No sense in making things difficult..\n\nI was the first one served.  Both my orders came out about 20 minutes after we ordered and it took another 30 or 40 minutes for the rest of the people to be served (It may have been longer).

That's an obscenely long time for a “lunch”.\n\nShe wouldn't split up the check so we had to handle it ourselves.

She counted the cash at the table and there was over $100.. she then ran off to charge the cards.  After ten to fifteen minutes she came back with stuff for us to sign.. We sign and head out.\n\nAll is well I thought.  We got half way backed out of the space when she comes charging out of the restaurant with charge tickets waiving trying to stop us..  Of course we stop, and ask what the problem is. I thought we didn't pay enough.. someone forgot their card.. someone didn't sign.. something..\n\nShe actually said, “You didn't tip!” .... “The amount on the bill wasn't with tip, and you didn't tip but 10%”...    Uh.. you're shitting me right?!  Did you actually just charge after us because you feel we didn't give you a big enough tip?!\n\nWhat the fuck?!  We paid the bill..

If I performed poorly I knew I wasn't going to get much.. And I never though it was okay to go confront my customers about it..  That's NEVER okay..  She got 10%, and her final performance was very much like the rest of it – makes me want to ask for that 10% back.\n","collection":"posts","url":"/tipping-is-a-gratuity/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2007-05-01-big5-to-utf-8-on-chinese-windows.md","collection":"posts","url":"/big5-to-utf-8-on-chinese-windows/","path":"_posts/2007-05-01-big5-to-utf-8-on-chinese-windows.md","id":"/big5-to-utf-8-on-chinese-windows","draft":false,"categories":["Software Development"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Big5 to UTF-8 on Chinese Windows","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2007-05-01 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"big5-to-utf-8-on-chinese-windows","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2007-04-10-tipping-is-a-gratuity.md","excerpt":"I really hate how in America today, and most likely the world wide, tipping is required.

And let me say that I find it amusing that English windows does unicode better than Chinese windows.. How is that even possible?!\n\nWe are in the process of internationalizing our product, and we stumbled across this bizarre issue where a person in Taiwan on a Chinese windows machine couldn't enter simplified Chinese into our product.  Doing so would give unpredictable results.\n\nSo, I picked 5 random simplified Chinese characters that sat across the character set;\n\n? - 5355 (16) / E5 8D 95 (8)\n? - 7684 (16) / E7 9A 84 (8)\n? - 7B80 (16) / E7 AE 80 (8)\n? - 6C49 (16) / E6 B1 89 (8)\n? - 5B57 (16) / E5 AD 97 (8)\n\nThese 5 characters are spread nicely across the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unicode.org/cgi-bin/UnihanRadicalIndex.pl?strokes=4&useutf8=false\">Radical-stroke index</a> and all have commonality to one another across UTF-16/UTF-8 and bits.\n\nSo, after much rigmarole I secured myself an account on the box and began to test it, and sure enough these 5 Chinese characters (?????) have proven to me that internationalization stinks.. heh  Depending on the order in which they are placed, random ones would show up..  Rearrange them, double them, spaces between.. whatever.. Always different ones would show.\n\nBut ONLY on the Chinese version of windows.  Locally using our own boxes, it works great. No worries. But over there, strangeness. After much ado and testing both locally and in Taiwan it appears that the Chinese version of windows tries to concatenate the bits of each symbol and make them into a single letter due to them being in a certain order.\n\nIn other words, it's trying to say that X number of characters after the first one are combining characters.  Where X = a random number of them.  And it appears completely random.. No amount of byte/bit/hex/dec whatever seems to pan out to the reason this is happening.\n\nSomething that you'd think the people in Taiwan would know about and maybe give us a clue to -- naw..  So now we have to figure out how to make it work correctly.. *sigh*\n\nPain I tell ya..  Clearly there is a solution.. I mean other people have crossed this bridge..  Though after digging into this it's interesting how many different applications aren't UTF-8 compliant at all.  Linux does this at the OS level, windows doesn't.  The results seem to be that the majority of the software in the windows world thus doesn't correctly support it.\n\nheh the bug tracking tool we use here at work doesn't either, which I find amusing.  Do you know how hard it is to talk about Chinese characters in a tool that wont let you write any?!\n\nMore as we fight through this.. we haven't solved it yet.. it should be interesting to say the least..\n","collection":"posts","url":"/big5-to-utf-8-on-chinese-windows/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2007-05-01-big5-to-utf-8-on-chinese-windows.md","collection":"posts","url":"/big5-to-utf-8-on-chinese-windows/","path":"_posts/2007-05-01-big5-to-utf-8-on-chinese-windows.md","id":"/big5-to-utf-8-on-chinese-windows","draft":false,"categories":["Software Development"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Big5 to UTF-8 on Chinese Windows","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2007-05-01 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"big5-to-utf-8-on-chinese-windows","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2007-05-09-more-riaa-thuggery.md","content":"I maintain that the RIAA are a bunch of thugs and bullies with nothing better to do than harass not only you the consumer, but the artists themselves by using litigious threats and terrorist tactics to get their way.  I ask you, is it possible for the RIAA to display more greed or avarice without actually hiring Satan as its general counsel?\n\nThe RIAA is known for <a href=\"http://www.musiccdsettlement.com/english/default.htm\" target=\"_blank\">alienating it's fans by over charging</a>, <a href=\"http://archive.salon.com/21st/feature/1998/10/28feature.html\" target=\"_blank\">completely failing to embrace any semblance of new technology</a> and then <a href=\"http://www.droxy.com/2005/09/29/riaa-doesnt-like-new-satellite-portable-music-unit/\" target=\"_blank\">sues anyone who tries to give music fans what they want</a>.\n\nThe \"Recording Industry Artists Association\" (RIAA) has not one damn thing to do with the artists. And now, as a thank you to the artists that made the RIAA what it is, the RIAA is making moves to reduce artist royalty payments.\n\nThe RIAA is burning the candle at both ends.  They are pissing off consumers, and pissing on the artists they supposedly support.  It really does seem like every decision they make has something to do with the limiting of the exposure of the music that artists create. This is contrary to anything that an artist would want, but then the simple fact of the matter is the RIAA has NOTHING to do with artists.\n\nThe latest in a long line of unbelievable bullshit that they are actually getting away with is the decision that was pushed through in March by the United States Copyright Royalty Board (CRB) which will make all webcasting royalties going forward, AND dating back to 2006 so expensive as to make any kind of legal streaming station completely unfeasible.\n\nThis is an attempt by the RIAA to kill any and all streaming music on the internet, further limiting exposure of their clients content.\n\nDigitally Imported Radio (<a href=\"http://di.fm\" target=\"_blank\">http://di.fm</a>) one of my favorite stations which I happily pay a fee to has stated;\n  * The new fees, making us owe literally more than *two million dollars* due July 15th, do not take any realistic business model of a service such as ours and most others on the web into account.  The short story translation is that Digitally Imported the company already owes just for 2006 many many times more in royalty fees than all combined revenue generated.\n  * Imagine a picture similar to if for every $1 we earn before even any expenses, we actually owe about $5 in royalty fees.\n  * This situation spells doom for webcasting on the Internet, and many services such as Digitally Imported Radio will be forced to stop all public webcasting, switch to subscriptions only, or SHUT DOWN ENTIRELY - WITHIN MONTHS, IF NOT WEEKS!\nWhat?! God damn it!  I actually like di.fm.. I think they are great!   I can tell you right now my productivity at work will slip if my music goes away, but thats another story..\n\nYou may be saying, \"Well the CRB isn't the RIAA\".. True, however the it was the RIAA's idea.  The whole thing got pushed through by SoundExchange which is a non-profit organization originally created and puppetted by the RIAA.\n\nBasically what they have done is passed a law that states that any web broadcasting business is not taxed on the amount of people that actually make a purchase, but rather they're taxed on every person that happens to listen to the stream at all.\n\nImagine if you will, that your favorite FM radio station incurred a fee every time someone channel surfed by their station.  Oh you heard a 3 second clip of XYZ song, pay us $1.  Yes it's that bad.\n\nThis crap forces the small law abiding independent webcasters to switch to the dark side, and become illegal if they want to stay in any kind of business.   Suddenly they have to leave the US to continue their business.  In most cases this wont work either as there are legal precedents that have established that as long as the listener is in the US, they are still liable.  And affordable high capacity bandwidth in the US also make moving to another country highly unlikely..\n\nSomething to think about:\n\nTerrestrial AM/FM radio stations in the US pay nothing for recording industry royalties due to a law made in consideration of promotion value that playing provides in return.\n\nSatellite Radio services have to pay 7.5% of revenue - which I think is a bit high, but I understand the reason since its a subscriber system anyway - there typically isn't a \"free\" satellite station.\n\nThe new law makes webcasters have to pay any where from 100% to 500% of revenue.\n\nArtists, you MUST distance yourself from the RIAA.  They do not have your interests at heart.  Their goal is simply self service, and this latest move is a completely blatant attack on your musics exposure.  Next the RIAA will be suing the content creators (artists).\n\nThe RIAA - Text book example of what NOT to do to your customers or supporters.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.savenetradio.org/\" target=\"_blank\">This bill gets pushed through July 15, 2007.  In my mind, it will forever be known as the Day the Music Dies, unless... </a>\n","collection":"posts","url":"/more-riaa-thuggery/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2007-06-18-whats-new.md","collection":"posts","url":"/whats-new/","path":"_posts/2007-06-18-whats-new.md","id":"/whats-new","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Whats new...","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/photos/wedding/wedding_example1.jpg","ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2007-06-18 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"whats-new","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2007-05-09-more-riaa-thuggery.md","excerpt":"I maintain that the RIAA are a bunch of thugs and bullies with nothing better to do than harass not only you the consumer, but the artists themselves by using litigious threats and terrorist tactics to get their way.","id":"/more-riaa-thuggery","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"More RIAA Thuggery","layout":"post","tags":["RIAA"],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2007-05-09 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"more-riaa-thuggery","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2007-05-01-big5-to-utf-8-on-chinese-windows.md","excerpt":"Microsoft has yet again been a source of pain for me..
