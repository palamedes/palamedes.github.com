Well I'm a better Warlock than you are.. and I'll prove it!!\"  etc..\n\nPlayers end up putting a lot of time and effort in to trying to make their cookie cutter class stand out from all the other cookie cutter classes.  That in and of itself forces a person to form a bond or an identity with their character making them want to keep playing..\n\nWhen you can start your characters virtual life as being 100% unique, you have one less thing to strive for..  So while it's really cool I can go out of my way to make my character look completely different.. it doesn't lend itself to longevity..\n\nThis also completely ruins the whole sense of community around a given class which is a problem.. What's more community is completely thrashed by the total lack of classes where group play happens..  The open architecture of characters, while initially cool, makes group forming painful because suddenly you can't say \"We need a healer\" and know that there are only 3 or 4 basic classes that heal..\n\nSTO appears to have classes with regards to ships; tanks, dps, and support ships.  So that's a damn good sign.  I'm hoping the realize the issues I described above and are working to correct the issue.. But I still have fears about the game as a whole..\n\nFor example; I absolutely cringe at the notion of wandering around a space station and having random NPC's run up and yell about how awesome I am like they did in CoH/CoV and CO..  Please rip that page out of the CoH/CoV/CO hand book and burn it..\n\nI also worry that the game's look (read: graphics) are dated even before the game has been released.  Cryptic has always intentionally made their games sort of \"middle of the road\" with regards to hardware requirements so it's very likely that the game will not be super high quality, but even so they screen shots look very lack-luster.   These could all be beta shots with poor textures or something, but I doubt it.\n\nI'm the first to admit that gameplay comes over graphics every time though, so if the game play is good then I can forgive just about any graphics decisions.. But then they aren't known for their game play so its easy to jump to conclusions..\n\nI guess my greatest fear is that Star Trek Online will end up being \"City of Star Trek\" and will be to Star Trek, what the original Star Wars MMO was to Star Wars.

You wont be saving money, instead you'll be giving your money to these unscrupulous companies who are doing their best through fear to drive the price as high as it can go before it crashes.  And it will crash.  Let me explain why;\n\nSee.. Gold is a commodity and a standard.  As such, it's value never really changes.  What changes is the dollars value in relation to the gold.. So when you see golds value go up, what you're actually seeing is the dollar go down.  When you have say 10 ounces of gold worth $3000, and suddenly that prices shoots to $10000 what you're actually seeing is the value of the dollar shoot down.  10 ounces of gold is still just 10 ounces of gold.\n\nWhen the dollar strengthens again (as it always does) you'll see the price of gold go back down to something more reasonable.  This is why I say gold WILL crash..  that means that the folks who purchased gold at $1120 an ounce will take it on the chin..\n\nI'm not saying that you should never buy gold.. Actually I think gold can be a good thing to buy, but only when the dollar is very strong (and thus the price of gold is lower).\n","collection":"posts","url":"/buy-gold-just-not-right-now/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2010-01-05-buy-gold-just-not-right-now.md","collection":"posts","url":"/buy-gold-just-not-right-now/","path":"_posts/2010-01-05-buy-gold-just-not-right-now.md","id":"/buy-gold-just-not-right-now","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Buy gold!!!

Let people pick it up!   Most likely you've gotten all the early adopters you're going to get, now is the time to shuffle it out to the stores so the masses can get a hold of it.\n\nI think if the hold outs just got the device in their hands they'd see that the device itself is rock solid.  I love how everything just works.  Little things that were an issue with the iphone (granted it's a gen one iphone) this phone doesn't have.   Everything just works.\n\nStreaming Music from a site of my choosing ( <a href=\"http://di.fm/\" target=\"_blank\">http://di.fm</a> highly recommended ) ?  Yeah that works..  Streaming music that requires an authentication?  Yeah that works..  Straight to your A2DP stereo bluetooth headset?  yeah that works..  Put the phone down and leave it for 2 hours while you're doing something else.. come back and just poke play on your headset to resume?  Yeah.. that works too..   Been listening to some vocal trance the whole time I wrote this, and I've been wandering around the house a bit too..\n\nNone of that worked on my iphone.   And the bluetooth antenna rocks btw.. my iphone to headset pairing was weak and kinda crappy.. Not here -- the pairing is good and I have yet to have static or noise creep in unlike on the iphone.\n\nJust more examples of how good the hardware is.  I think google really was trying to build the cadillac of phones.    When ordering, I was concerned about the make of the product -- I was worried it would be flimsy or weak in some ways but its not at all.  The hardware feels solid though it does suffer the same \"greasy screen\" issues that all modern phones suffer.  I will say this for the iphone, it felt solid.  This phone feels the same way.  It's a teeny-tiny bit larger than the iphone so it doesn't fit in the belt case I like.. damn it.. heh but the weight is about the same.\n\nThe new OLED screen is amazing.  Sitting next to my iPhone at with the N1 at half brightness, its much brighter than the iphone.  In fact it makes the iphones screen look dull by comparison.\n\nI think android 2.1 works great, I have yet to run into any problems..  I have read that some people have found bugs but I haven't seen any..  Maybe I don't know what to look for.. I dunno.\n\nThe call quality is good and more importantly the audio levels are high enough I can hear in a noisy room.  One of my main complaints with my iphone was that if there was ANY ambient noise I simply couldn't hear someone on the phone, and the speaker phone was a joke.  The speaker phone on the Nexus still isn't as loud as I would like, but its far better than the iphone.    My Nokia Communicator had a GREAT speakerphone.. clearly phone makers need to contact the nokia folks and find out how its done..\n\nLike I keep saying.. it just works.. yay!\n\nIssues as I see them so far;\n\nGoogles grand plan is to change the face of the cell phone industry by offering a device that can doesn't limit you to a carrier.  Amen Brother.   But then they tether it to T-Mobile?  I can't help but think that this was a mistake.   In my opinion the number 1 killer of the iPhone was AT&amp;T.  Here in the Austin area the network is so saturated that it doesn't work.  AT&amp;T simply wasn't ready to handle the influx of customers that the iPhone generated.  T-Mobile (formerly VoiceStream) will suffer the same problem if the Nexus is even remotely as popular as the iphone was when it hit the market.\n\nI know they are releasing other versions of the phone to other carriers, but how does that change what we have today?  You're still locked to a network.   More over, even if you purchased the unlocked version of the phone you're still tied to one network due to 3G frequencies ..etc..  For example;  Right now this phone won't work with AT&amp;T's 3G network. Period.\n\nWe shall see..\n\nIt's still a new offering and I was a day one adopter so I don't know if this is a fair criticism on my part, but there are ZERO accessories for this sucker.  I know give it a month.. but still.  I want a stand.. some carrying case options.. some screen protection options..etc..\n\nWhat the hell is the point of the track ball?   I'm worried about the track ball popping out or in some way breaking.. It's the only part of the phone that concerns me because it kinda sticks out.    And it really seems to serve no purpose..   Again it's something that folks can use so we will likely see games that use it soon.\n\nI just had another complaint pop into and out of my head before I could write it down and now I can't remember what it was.. damn it..\n\nIt's not perfect.. but it's a wonderful device.\n\nI hate the question \"Is it the iphone killer\".. that's just a retarded question.. It's a damn good device, hows that?  I think for googles first try, its awesome and worth every penny.\n","collection":"posts","url":"/hardware-review-nexus-one/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2010-01-18-game-review-star-trek-online.md","collection":"posts","url":"/game-review-star-trek-online/","path":"_posts/2010-01-18-game-review-star-trek-online.md","id":"/game-review-star-trek-online","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"PVP and Star Trek Online","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2010/01/sto.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2010-01-18 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"game-review-star-trek-online","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2010-01-10-hardware-review-nexus-one.md","excerpt":"I was tired of my original iPhone and that would be getting the Sony Ericsson Xperia X10 when it came out some time later this year.   That was before I heard/read about Google's offering; the Nexus One.","id":"/hardware-review-nexus-one","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Hardware Review: Nexus One","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2010/01/nexusone.png","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2010-01-10 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"hardware-review-nexus-one","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2010-01-18-game-review-star-trek-online.md","content":"<img class=\"pull-right\" title=\"Star Trek Online\" src=\"/images/2010/01/sto.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"210\" height=\"110\" />\n\nWhy I think they might actually have gotten it right.\n\nFirstly, I was really worried when I found out the end game for STO would be PVP-centric.  That just doesn't really work normally for any number of reasons which I wont go into just yet.. Traditionally if you look at all the major (even minor) MMO's out there that have tried, you'll see that they have generally failed or aren't entirely PVP based..   Eve Online being one that hasn't failed and does really well, but I believe that's largely due to being the only game in it's market.   By and large however, PVP only games just don't do that well with the masses..\n\nI believe that there are 4 primary reasons for PVP being problematic in most games:\n\n1.  PVP allows Player X to have an immediate and often negative impact on Player Y's game play experience.   This means that Player Y could possibly have his game play impacted by another player in such a way as to prevent him from enjoying or even advancing in the game.  Removing the \"fun\" from the game for Player Y entirely.\n\n2.  Good PVP and Smart PVP are two mutually exclusive concepts.  \"Good\" PVP is playing against another person where things are evenly matched in terms of player skills, character skills, gear, etc..  The fight is even odds and could go either way and as such, is a \"fair\" fight..   \"Smart\" PVP is employing any tactic that would give the player any form of advantage over the intended target -- fairness doesn't enter into it.   In fact the more unfair the fight is, the better.  Since most players always try to play smartly, the target of that doesn't have fun.\n\n3.  Everyone loses eventually, and most players lose most of the time.  This is simply math and has been proven time and again.  In any PVP engagement, you will eventually lose.  And most players, yes you too, lose most of the time.  It's a mathematical inevitability.  People don't like to lose as it's not fun.\n\n4.  Character skills and gear out weigh, player skills and gear every time.  In most PVP games it just about always pans out that the higher level and better equipped character will simply dominate the lower level character, regardless of the players skill or equipment. So no matter how awesome you are on your level 45 warlock, that level 50 paladin will simply slaughter you while watching TV and eating some pizza.. not fun.\n\nWhy are these things bad?  Well first of all you might have noticed I used \"fun\" in each point.  Games are first and foremost about fun.  If you aren't having fun then most likely you're not going to play very long.\n\nI think someone at cryptic looked at these facts and made the right decision to make PVP opt-in only.  Let's look at each issue in turn;\n\nThe first one can actually punish a player, just for playing the game. They might be having fun mining asteroids for example, wanting nothing to do with other people only to have their experience tainted by someone else..  I think most hard core PVP players completely miss the fact that what is fun for them, isn't the same thing as what's fun for everyone else and games are first and foremost about fun for everyone.  STO has made PVP an opt-in system so that you must knowingly go to the various PVP zones in order to do any form of PVP.  If you don't want to, you don't have to.\n\nThis opt-in methodology also largely solves the second issue. You can't be gate camped or ganked or griefed by a roaming pack of players in the regular world.. You must go into the PVP area where you acknowledge the possibility and most likely will bring your own posse..\n\nIf you know PVP is opt-in, then you wont mind losing on occasion.  STO makes the PVP very \"Zerg\" like in that if you do lose, you just respawn and off you go again.. So really dying a lot doesn't matter all that much. So who cares if you lose more than you win.. It's still fun!\n\nAnd so far the ship buffs/abilities and stats don't really seem to matter.   In my lowbie T1 Miranda class ship I was able to take out T2 ships in PVP.  I don't know if this was due to my better understanding of shield and power management or if my equipment was better or if I was a better player..  Or if I was just lucky!  But right now it seems like player skill actually matters a great deal more than everything else..\n\nI think it could work here..\n\nA lot of folks are bitching about not having open realm PVP though and those people irritate me..\n\nTheir primary complaint is that they should be able to attack any other player at any time.. And they always gloss it over with reasons why it would be canonically correct in a Star Trek universe..blah blah blah..\n\nLet's be clear;  the only people that would disagree with the opt-in PVP system are the PVP players who are the ones most offended by the notion that they some how do something \"unfair\" by attacking people that aren't as skilled, have no desire to participate, or who aren't in anyway ready for the PVP conflict they are suddenly thrust into without any option.   Simply put,  they are griefers who enjoy ruining other peoples game by taking out the easy target.\n\nI'm an old school PVP player from EVE online.  I have also PVP'd in EQ and WoW so I know where I'm coming from here.\n\nIn EVE when I went into a fight, I made damn sure it was going to be a fight I was going to win or at least had a good chance of winning.  If I didn't think it would go my way, I would unass the AO ASAP.\n\nIf I was going to steal jet can's (Yes I did that..) I made sure my target was someone I knew I could steal from without being instakilled.   When camping a gate in EVE I wouldn't do it alone, but rather would bring a whole crew -- why?  'cause I wanted to win!\n\nIt's just smart PVP -- don't engage in a fight you can't win.  The same notion is employed by modern day generals when waging war..  Don't play fair!!  Smart PVP will never be fair if the PVP'er knows what he is doing. A fair fight will get you killed every time.\n\nThere are a lot of players though who will never want to be apart of that world.. they want to play the game to have fun, and not PVP and they should be allowed to do so.   For them the fun is playing against the system and NPC's.. It's the same reason why raiding end game bosses in WoW and EQ is fun.. It's the challenge of beating the system..   Whether you, the hard core PVP'er, agree is completely immaterial.\n\nThus when you attack them unprovoked in systems that allow for that, they rightly call you a griefer because you're interrupting their fun.    I have griefed in my time, and been griefed.. so I understand..\n\nThe game designers in STO have rightly realized that it's an absolute imperitive to make the game fun for as many people as possible, and to do that PVP must be opt-in.  It's the only way to keep the largest portion of the population happy.\n\nThe simple fact of the matter is, if you attack someone who doesn't want to be attacked then you're negatively affecting their game play.  And the larger picture is;  Doing so will in many cases drive those players away from the game, which means now you're negatively affecting the developing studio's bottom line.  \"Carebears\", a term I hate, are by far the largest segment of the market and keeping them happy keeps the game afloat.\n\nKudos Cryptic.\n","collection":"posts","url":"/game-review-star-trek-online/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2010-01-18-game-review-star-trek-online.md","collection":"posts","url":"/game-review-star-trek-online/","path":"_posts/2010-01-18-game-review-star-trek-online.md","id":"/game-review-star-trek-online","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"PVP and Star Trek Online","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2010/01/sto.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2010-01-18 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"game-review-star-trek-online","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2010-01-19-game-review-star-trek-online-2.md","content":"<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2010/01/Enterprise.jpg\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Star Trek Online Review\" src=\"/images/2010/01/Enterprise-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Star Trek Online Review\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Star Trek Online Review</span></a>\n\nFirstly I want to say that I personally think it's extremely hard to judge a game entirely by the first 15 levels..  Any MMO to date that one cares to name changes drastically as you play across the level range and to judge that game by the first couple levels is simply foolish.  You haven't experienced the whole of the game.. So I'm going to post my review about it, but I want you to keep in mind that there are going to be a lot of things I simply haven't done yet..\n\nAlso, there are a lot of people on the forums bashing the game for one reason or another, some reasons are valid, some aren't.    I would argue that most of those people really haven't truly experienced the game in its fullest, but at the same time I will concede the point that if it doesn't appeal to them early on, it may not later either and that they should just move on without the flames.\n\nWhat you're not seeing on the forums is the influx of praise or posts by people who are largely happy, not because they don't exist but rather because the complainers are typically a lot more vocal minority.. People that complain loudly are typically those people who think they are righteous and have entitlement issues..  They are \"right and by god you're gonna know my opinion..\"\n\nSo with that -- here's my righteous opinion on the the first 15 levels of fed play and the first 12 or so of Klingon.. I only really have 2 major complaints.\n\nBut first some general over arching comments -- please keep in mind there is no order to my thoughts;\n\nThe server's are completely flooded and Cryptic wasn't ready for the load.. Completely understandable if you consider that they just opened up the beta for quite possibly the single most popular science fiction IP on the planet. (Is star trek more popular than star wars? I don't actually know..) They are aware of the issue and have stated repeatedly that they are taking action to fix it. Kudos guys.\n\nI have seen people bitch that \"this has been the worst beta ever\" and that simply isn't true.  Not even close.  I'm pretty sure Anarchy Online still holds that title firmly, and likely will forever..  In fact I don't really think this beta has been all that bad considering the volume of traffic they are getting.. Sure there are queues, server lag, and disconnects but all of those are brought about by the volume of players..  In fact the majority of the issues the game has can likely be traced back to simple server lag due to volume.\n\nIs it bug free?  no.   But then neither is WoW or EQ and those games have been out for years. I don't really understand why people expect a brand new game to be bug free.. *shrug*  I do take it as a very positive sign that they have patched the game every night during the open beta..  That implies to me that they are actively working on the issues which is great.\n\nI think the game graphics look good.. I have seen quite a few threads on the forums about how they graphics look poor, and I just don't agree.  It doesn't look photo realistic like some of the very early preview teaser images did years ago, but that's okay.. It looks good and succeeds in suspending my disbelief into thinking I'm playing a game in a Star Trek universe.\n\nThe UI is good though the map system needs to be better explained. It took me a while to understand the area map and the galaxy map and why some systems were in my system list some of the time, and not in my list other parts of the time..etc.. It's easy once you understand it but completely confusing while you don't..  Lack of documentation or explanation is almost a theme in this game..\n\nThe skills are confusing but mostly because they don't explain what they do well enough. It also doesn't explain well enough things like your characters class to ship class combination's.. Is it a bad idea to be an engineer, in a science ship? Why? If it is bad that means if you go science you're stuck in the same 2 ships for 20 levels.. ouch.. (maybe longer, I don't know what ships are available at T3)\n\nWhat does +18 in Science Vessel Captain actually do for me? Games like WoW, Eve, and even Champions to some degree have a LOT of math behind it.. This game clearly does too but you don't really expose that math to the players in a clear way. A lot of players, myself included, actually enjoy pondering the right character build and the best way we can achieve what it is we want to such a degree as to actually build spreadsheets.. Eve is a game totally about spreadsheets ( a little too spreadsheety at times ) and players love that.. Expose those numbers to us.. Let us know what skilling up something actually does, or all of those skills you invested all that time in to create for us mean nothing.\n\nI'm sure all of these things will be documented eventually but right now it smacks of information that the developers all know and think of as obvious where as the players coming to it for the first time just stand there confused.   Documentation is your friend.\n\nThe ground combat is a little weak right now and I personally think it's boring, repetitive and painfully scripted but I think it will develop over time.  It very much smacks of CoH door missions and that system needs more versatility.  Give players options that change the outcome.. etc..   I can't say as I enjoy the ground combat much though because every game to date has been about ground combat.  I'm much more interested in the space combat, that being said they still have a lot of work to do on the ground if they plan to serve both..\n\nAs to space combat, Right now I can say I really enjoy it though it gets very \"samey\" pretty quickly.    I think that's largely due to the fact that I have experienced basically 4 ships total..  And flying around seeing nothing (mostly) but Miranda ships get's old..\n\nPersonally I hope there are a lot more ships in the game come release.  I love how the ships are customizable but there still aren't enough chassis and what not to choose from.  Maybe that gets better later on, but in the beginning its weak as you have 1 ship.  Then when you level up to get your tier two ships, you have a choice of three technically but since you already decided your officer type (tactical, engineer or science) you only really have 1 logical choice.\n\nI think players identify with their avatars a lot more than most game creators take into account and as such they need to give us even more options.  Plus the ability to add fleet markings would be handy.  It's minor I know, but it helps establish community and a sense of pride which is important in an MMO.\n\nI could make a long list of other complaints like, why did they go with left and right versus port and starboard.. Or why isn't there any Klingon PVE play etc.. but really at this point I'd rather talk about whats there than what's NOT there.. So with that -- I have two complaints:\n\nMajor Complaint One -- One of the worst mistakes they could make in this game is the same thing that in my mind killed the City franchise and Champions..  I'm gonna call it \"Mission leveling\" for the lack of a better term. The concept is this;  You get a mission and the more people that do the mission with you, the harder the mission gets.   So if you solo a mission you fight one or two weak mobs, but if you bring a whole group suddenly its 3 or 4 hard hitting bosses and several weaker mobs..etc..\n\nSounds like a good idea on the surface, but CoH and CO proved it to be a horrible idea because it actually encourages players to NOT group.. this kills the need for \"community\"..  More over it gives players no sense of accomplishment because they know a mission is simply a cake walk if they solo it.  There should be things in the game that require groups and missions should be statically leveled.  Do away with this balancing thing..It's a failed experiment..\n\nYou should be able to get missions that are so hard you can't do it without help..  Missions that scale like they do is just a bad design and this is the third time they have done it..\n\nA mission that is the same level as you, should present you with mobs that are roughly the same as you.. If it's a higher level mission they should be harder hitting.. if it's lower level they should be weaker..etc..\n\nI realize that this is very much the WoW and EQ model for doing quests but it has stood the test of time and it's a known..  Right now I can't help but think they have broken this very simple concept.\n\nMajor Complaint Two --  I want crafting.. I want to be able to harvest asteroids like in Eve and create stuff.. I can't fathom an MMO game that has virtually no crafting system what so ever..  And sorry but the current system they have that they say is like crafting simply isn't.\n\nMindlessly warping around a mission looking for the various anomolies that you get crap from that let you turn in for an upgraded item.. yeah that's not crafting.. I hope they fix that..\n\nIn the end there is a little bit of the \"city of star trek\" that I was worried about in my earlier post.  There is a little bit of champions in it.. there is a little of city in it.. etc..  Cryptic is going with what they know.. But they might have enough of a winner here because its sort of two games in one (space and ground) and with the addition of PVP in both places you sorta have 4 games in one..  Now consider the ability to play both sides, federation or klingon and now its x2 again..\n\nThere might be enough different options to keep this game going for a while.. I'm enjoying it for now at least..\n","collection":"posts","url":"/game-review-star-trek-online-2/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2010-01-23-german-type-vii-submarine.md","collection":"posts","url":"/german-type-vii-submarine/","path":"_posts/2010-01-23-german-type-vii-submarine.md","id":"/german-type-vii-submarine","draft":false,"categories":["Hobbies"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"German Type VII Submarine","layout":"post","tags":["3D Model"],"image":"/images/2010/01/type-vii-15.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2010-01-23 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"german-type-vii-submarine","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2010-01-19-game-review-star-trek-online-2.md","excerpt":"Here's my righteous opinion on the the first 15 levels of fed play and the first 12 or so of Klingon..
