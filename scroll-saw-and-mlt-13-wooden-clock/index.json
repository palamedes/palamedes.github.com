(Leave the designing to the designers I guess.. Its good to know what I'm not good at..heh)\n\n<a href=\"/images/2012/02/shop01.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"Tellico Turnings 02\" src=\"/images/2012/02/shop01-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Tellico Turnings\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>The pens and calls table</span></a>\n\nHe has just the right amount of space with the right number of items out presented in an organized and uncluttered way that I think really does a good job of showing off the various pieces.\n\nThe market is open Friday, Saturday and Sunday each week from roughly 9am to 6pm each day except Sunday which I believe was 10 to 5.   Plus all the vendors around you are actually quite nice, friendly and even helpful. More over, the environment for the vendors is one that actually promotes helping one another as opposed to infighting or backstabbing which is really nice.\n\nIt's unfortunate that his first weekend wasn't a stellar one.  He made rent which is all that really matters but it would be nice if he had sold more his first weekend out if for no other reason than to inspire and excite..\n\n<a href=\"/images/2012/02/shop02.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Tellico Turnings\" src=\"/images/2012/02/shop02-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Tellico Turnings\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Peppermills and Stuff</span></a>\n\nProbably completely unrealistic for him to do better than he did considering it was;\n\na) his first weekend there and no one knew where he was,\nb) between pay days so no one had money,\nc) between major holidays so no one had a \"reason\" to buy things,\nd) there was a major dinosaur exhibit in town which kept the crowd down, and\ne) a large format gun show which also that kept the crowd down.. etc..\n\nAll that working against him and he still made enough sales to pay for itself..  So I guess I shouldn't complain too much.. I just really wanted him to sell out! hah\n\nFor me it was a disappointment but he's an old hat at doing markets and having a booth selling stuff and so he knows that it can be feast or famine.. he didn't seem put out by it at all..\n\nThe crowd Friday was admittedly dismal which apparently is very common there.. Saturday and Sunday however had a lot of folks coming through and just about all of them picked up stuff and took cards which is a great sign for his future there..\n\n<a href=\"/images/2012/02/shop03.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"Tellico Turnings\" src=\"/images/2012/02/shop03-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Tellico Turnings\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Wine table &amp; Lamps</span></a>\n\nMy only concern at this point is that his stuff is actually too nice for the venue and that people might think of the market more as a \"flea market\" than an actual hand crafted goods marketplace..   Only time will tell here and we probably don't need to do any second guessing at this early stage based on a single weekend..\n\nMore over I think it will take a couple weeks to figure out what works and what doesn't work and then adjust accordingly.  More than likely he's going to have to start adding a lot of less expensive stock that will sit next to the really nice stuff just to draw folks in..\n\nAfter all, selling 10x $5 items is just as good as selling a single $50 item..   Certainly a lot less fun to make but you gotta make stuff that sells..\n\n<a href=\"/images/2012/02/shop04.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Tellico Turnings\" src=\"/images/2012/02/shop04-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Tellico Turnings\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Dad in the background</span></a>\n\nAfter only a few days I had to return home and get back to work.. Apparently my boss wants me to actually \"earn\" my living.. psh.. slave driver I tell ya..\n\nI made the 1000 mile drive straight from East TN to Central Texas in under 16 hours and had a seriously sore backside to prove it..  I also had a SUV full of wood and project ideas, as well as plans to make some signage for the shop.\n\nAll in all it was a great trip and one I'll likely make again in the future.\n\nI really like Tennessee and one of these days will likely move there more permanently..  For now I'm stuck in Texas though... Y'all.\n\nThe trip was really great and it was fun to hang out with the folks but it really made me realize that my home is where ever my wife is.. sappy, but true.\n\n","previous":{"next":{"path":"_posts/2012-02-29-dads-new-store.md","url":"/dads-new-store/","relative_path":"_posts/2012-02-29-dads-new-store.md","id":"/dads-new-store","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Hobbies"],"layout":"post","title":"My latest trip to TN and Dads new store","tags":["Wood Working"],"type":"post","published":true,"image":"/images/2012/02/shop00.jpg","allow_comments":true,"date":"2012-02-29 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"dads-new-store","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2012-02-13-scroll-saw-and-mlt-13-wooden-clock.md","output":null,"content":"<a href=\"/images/2012/02/clockgears14.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Gear Test Fit!\" src=\"/images/2012/02/clockgears14-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Gear Test Fit!\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Latest Image</span></a>\n\nI have always been a very artsy-craftsy^(1) person as I thoroughly enjoy making things.  I like working with my hands and creating something from nothing.   I've made leather and steel armor for the SCA, bows and crossbows and a mandolin that actually doesn't sound half bad.  I've done some wood turning and created all manner of pens, peppermills and even a rolling pin and I have even tried my hand at making furniture -- I'm not bad at it!   For whatever reason I seem to have a knack for crafting.\n\nSo in my time, I have worked with wood, steel, leather, plastic and various resins and agates..  The thing I have noticed is that no matter what I craft, I always seem to come back to wood.    There's something about wood that I am not sure I can put to words;  It's just easy to work with in that it's forgiving, versatile and beautiful.\n\nThe problem is no matter what I have made with wood (and there has been a lot) not any particular piece or style has ever really \"grabbed me\" as something I really enjoyed and wanted to do a lot of.\n\nMy father is an avid wood turner who cranks out pens, bowls and other awesome stuff that he sells at his own little shop and I have to admit, that's really inspiring..  He's making a living by turning a hunk of nothing, into <a href=\"http://www.tellicoturnings.com/products.html\" target=\"_blank\">something beautiful</a> that other folks want!  That's cool as hell.\n\nI tried my hand at turning for a while and it is fun but I don't know that it's \"the thing\" for me.  I like putting  a randomly shaped block or log of wood on the mandrel and shaping it into something new, but you're somewhat limited in what you can make..   I thought turning pens was fun, but those pen kits are expensive and the more I think about it the more I want to create something entirely out of wood without having to rely on some pre-made mass produced (over priced) internal kit..    I think it's one of the main reasons my father has gone to making bowls instead of the pen kits or even pepper mills..  He's creating something entirely unique that's 100% his own without any outside help.. (except tooling which doesn't count!)\n\nSo I have been pondering for a while what I could make that would excite me and be that thing that I enjoyed doing in my spare time..   I did enjoy the <a title=\"Mandolin Luthiery — Making and playing the Mandolin\" href=\"/mandolin-luthiery/\" target=\"_blank\">Mandolin experiment</a> but the more I worked on it the more I realized that it wasn't for me..  I think it's a good augment skill, sort of like turning, but not as a mainstay.  Plus it's really hard to be a maker of instruments, that you don't play.  I have a nice mandolin and I plink around on it sometimes but I will never be a good mando player.   I don't think I have the time or patience..\n\nThe thing that I took from the mandolin though is that I enjoy making something that is both meticulous in nature and functional.  With a mandolin (or any instrument) you have to pay very close attention to minor details or the instrument will sound bad.  I like that.  It speaks to my special form of brain damage, but what can you do.\n\nSo I was pondering what I wanted to do craft-hobby wise and I remember having a book on wooden clocks that has been on my shelf collecting dust for a couple years.  I started reading it (the first time I had actually cracked the book open) and realized that \"hey I can totally do this.\"   I started doing some research and came across two master craftsmen who are as inspirational as they come;  <a href=\"http://lisaboyer.com/Claytonsite/Claytonsite1.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Clayton Boyer</a> and <a href=\"http://www.woodthatworks.com/\" target=\"_blank\">David C. Roy</a>.\n\nClayton makes clocks that are both functional and beautiful.  He puts a lot of attention to detail in his creations and thus generates some amazing works.  Of all of his clocks I very much like the workings of his <a href=\"http://lisaboyer.com/Claytonsite/marblestrikepage1.htm\" target=\"_blank\">marble strike clock</a> ^(2) it's mechanical and meticulous nature appeals to me.    Being able to make something like this is one of my ultimate goals. (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTQ-oCj-Gf8&amp;feature=player_embedded\" target=\"_blank\">video</a>)\n\nDavid makes breath-taking kinetic sculptures that are mesmerizing to behold.. His style really seems unique on the internet and his wood working skills are second to none.   All of his sculptures are extremely high quality and it's clear to me that this is a labor of love for him, not just a day job.   His sculptures vary in style, size, scope and ability so it's hard to boil them down to one I like best.. but if I were pressed I'd probably say I like his <a href=\"http://www.woodthatworks.com/kinetic-sculptures/shimmer/\" target=\"_blank\">shimmer sculpture</a> ^(3) the best primarily because it was the first one I saw that turned me on to the rest of his art, so that first stunned viewing has really stuck with me.. (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iQO_UUjDqM&amp;feature=player_embedded\" target=\"_blank\">video</a>)\n\nSo armed with a book of clock plans, some plans I ordered from Clayton, and with the inspirational works of Clayton, David and my father too look at -- I decided I want to make clocks with an ultimate goal of combining both the functionality of clocks with the raw artful beauty of kinetic sculptures.  If they can do it, so can I.\n\nMy wood working tool collection isn't vast, but I had all the major pieces of hardware I would need to proceed except for a scroll saw.  I researched a bunch of different saws and found that as with anything you can spend a little or a lot of one of these things..  I went ahead and ordered what I felt was a nice one, a Dewalt 20\" variable speed scroll saw.  Dewalt has always done right by me so I went for it.\n\nI have never done any scroll saw work before so there was a bit of a learning curve but not too bad.. I printed out the <a href=\"http://wooden-clockworks.com/MLT-13.html\" target=\"_blank\">MLT-13 Clock</a> from the scrollsaw book I had, ordered and received some wood from woodcrafters and was off to the races..   The MLT-13 doesn't seem overly complex as clocks go and I had the machine and plans before I got any of the plans from Clayton so I figured I'd start with it..\n\n<a href=\"/images/2012/01/clockgears01.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"Complete Escape and 3rd Wheel Cog\" src=\"/images/2012/01/clockgears01-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Complete Escape and 3rd Wheel Cog\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Faster on the scroll saw</span></a>\n\nThe first gear I cut was the escape wheel and I did so on my bandsaw.  It was pretty rough and needed a lot of sanding and trimming in order to get it to look right.  Here you can see the second and EW finished being cut on the scroll saw once I received it.  It was much much easier to cut these things out on the scroll saw.\n\nI tried using round blades for a while but I found they were really rough in their cut and it required a lot of time to sand and smooth the backs of gears to repair all the tear outs..  I have gone to using skiptooth blades for the bigger stuff and reverse tooth blades for the small fine work.\n\n<a href=\"/images/2012/02/clockgears06.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Gear Assembly and Light\" src=\"/images/2012/02/clockgears06-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Gear Assembly and Light\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Gear Assembly and Light</span></a>\n\nIt got to the point where I was basically going blind trying to see what it was I was doing..   My eyes aren't what they used to be so I went ahead and purchased a magnifier / hobby light that I mounted to my work bench so that it would sit just above the saw..\n\nThe nice thing about this setup is that it both serves to magnify and light my work, as well as being eye protection.  I was concerned with vibration since that's a heavy light and lens out on the end of a rather spindly arm, but the dewalt has virtually zero vibration so the light doesn't move at all (except when I bump it which happens all the time..)\n\n<a href=\"/images/2012/02/clockgears14.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"Gear Test Fit!\" src=\"/images/2012/02/clockgears14-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Gear Test Fit!\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Gear Test Fit!</span></a>\n\nAs of this picture you can see that I have all the major pieces cut out and am in the fitting process..  The only thing I have left to create at this point are the hands.\n\nThere is some minor binding between my gears that I need to work out, I foresee some serious time with sandpaper ahead of me, but even so they do turn nicely if not 100% smoothly.\n\n<a href=\"/images/2012/02/clockgears11.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img

get the pendulum, pallet and escape wheel assembly to actually ticking though.   I'm still in the process of getting the clutch working correctly..\n\nThe wife and I sat down and figured out the colors..  We are going to go for a walnut for the body pieces and a cherry for the gearing.  Not sure if I want to leave any of the gears \"nude\" or not.  Three colors might be a bit too much.\n\nFor my next trick, trying to capture the elusive tick!\n\n__Update: 17 Feb 2012__\n\n<a href=\"/images/2012/02/20120217-213343.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"Recut Escape

tick!\n\nHere you can see my recut escape wheel on the left compared to the old one on the right.  I spent two days recutting this thing making sure it was as good as I could make it.\n\nI cut out the pinion and glued on (not showed in the picture) and remounted the new wheel.. it works much better.. even though the differences are minute, it makes a huge difference.\n\nI had to do some shaping on the pallets and I need to resand them as they are rough which is one problem, but some of my other gears are binding a tiny bit which means no constant tick.. but I get 8 to 10 \"ticks\" out of it before it catches or stops.\n\nI also don't have enough weight hanging off the bottom so I need to address that.. but I'm really excited.. it's so close!\n\n__Update: 3 Sep 2013__\n\n<a

height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Disassembled</span></a>\n\nI can't believe it's been so long since I started working on this thing..  It has hung on my wall silent for months and today I pulled it down and started investigating it further.  I was so close brefore but have learned a lot since then, so I wanted to give it a nother try.\n\nI found that I had done a lot of things wrong that I need to correct, and aim to do that over the course of the next week or two.  I was really close before, but it would always grind to a halt.. I'm gonna fix that..\n\n\n---\n\n\n^(1) It's interesting to note that neither \"artsy\" nor \"craftsy\" are words according to Merriam Webster, but <a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/artsy-craftsy\" target=\"_blank\">together they are a word</a>..

It's just a masterpiece..\n\n^(3) A few words about <a href=\"http://www.woodthatworks.com/kinetic-sculptures/shimmer/\" target=\"_blank\">Shimmer by David C. Roy</a>:  David has done a lot of different sculptures over the last 20+ years and the level of detail and precision he employs is nothing but impressive.  I like quite a few of his sculptures, some more than others but they are all very cool.   The thing that I like the most about shimmer though is how deceptively simple it is combined with how eye catching and even mesmerizing it is.   I wasn't kidding when I said above that it was the first one I stumbled across and that initial viewing has really stuck with me..   Many of his other works are far more complex than this one, but to me the simplicity of this one is part of it's beauty.   It's really nothing more than a spring powered escape mechanism that powers a childs optical illusion rendered in wood.  Awesome!

 That's cool as hell.\n\nI tried my hand at turning for a while and it is fun but I don't know that it's \"the thing\" for me.  I like putting  a randomly shaped block or log of wood on the mandrel and shaping it into something new, but you're somewhat limited in what you can make..   I thought turning pens was fun, but those pen kits are expensive and the more I think about it the more I want to create something entirely out of wood without having to rely on some pre-made mass produced (over priced) internal kit..    I think it's one of the main reasons my father has gone to making bowls instead of the pen kits or even pepper mills..  He's creating something entirely unique that's 100% his own without any outside help.. (except tooling which doesn't count!)\n\nSo I have been pondering for a while what I could make that would excite me and be that thing that I enjoyed doing in my spare time..   I did enjoy the <a title=\"Mandolin Luthiery — Making and playing the Mandolin\" href=\"/mandolin-luthiery/\" target=\"_blank\">Mandolin experiment</a> but the more I worked on it the more I realized that it wasn't for me..  I think it's a good augment skill, sort of like turning, but not as a mainstay.  Plus it's really hard to be a maker of instruments, that you don't play.  I have a nice mandolin and I plink around on it sometimes but I will never be a good mando player.   I don't think I have the time or patience..\n\nThe thing that I took from the mandolin though is that I enjoy making something that is both meticulous in nature and functional.  With a mandolin (or any instrument) you have to pay very close attention to minor details or the instrument will sound bad.  I like that.  It speaks to my special form of brain damage, but what can you do.\n\nSo I was pondering what I wanted to do craft-hobby wise and I remember having a book on wooden clocks that has been on my shelf collecting dust for a couple years.  I started reading it (the first time I had actually cracked the book open) and realized that \"hey I can totally do this.\"   I started doing some research and came across two master craftsmen who are as inspirational as they come;  <a href=\"http://lisaboyer.com/Claytonsite/Claytonsite1.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Clayton Boyer</a> and <a href=\"http://www.woodthatworks.com/\" target=\"_blank\">David C. Roy</a>.\n\nClayton makes clocks that are both functional and beautiful.  He puts a lot of attention to detail in his creations and thus generates some amazing works.  Of all of his clocks I very much like the workings of his <a href=\"http://lisaboyer.com/Claytonsite/marblestrikepage1.htm\" target=\"_blank\">marble strike clock</a> ^(2) it's mechanical and meticulous nature appeals to me.    Being able to make something like this is one of my ultimate goals. (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTQ-oCj-Gf8&amp;feature=player_embedded\" target=\"_blank\">video</a>)\n\nDavid makes breath-taking kinetic sculptures that are mesmerizing to behold.. His style really seems unique on the internet and his wood working skills are second to none.   All of his sculptures are extremely high quality and it's clear to me that this is a labor of love for him, not just a day job.   His sculptures vary in style, size, scope and ability so it's hard to boil them down to one I like best.. but if I were pressed I'd probably say I like his <a href=\"http://www.woodthatworks.com/kinetic-sculptures/shimmer/\" target=\"_blank\">shimmer sculpture</a> ^(3) the best primarily because it was the first one I saw that turned me on to the rest of his art, so that first stunned viewing has really stuck with me.. (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iQO_UUjDqM&amp;feature=player_embedded\" target=\"_blank\">video</a>)\n\nSo armed with a book of clock plans, some plans I ordered from Clayton, and with the inspirational works of Clayton, David and my father too look at -- I decided I want to make clocks with an ultimate goal of combining both the functionality of clocks with the raw artful beauty of kinetic sculptures.  If they can do it, so can I.\n\nMy wood working tool collection isn't vast, but I had all the major pieces of hardware I would need to proceed except for a scroll saw.  I researched a bunch of different saws and found that as with anything you can spend a little or a lot of one of these things..  I went ahead and ordered what I felt was a nice one, a Dewalt 20\" variable speed scroll saw.  Dewalt has always done right by me so I went for it.\n\nI have never done any scroll saw work before so there was a bit of a learning curve but not too bad.. I printed out the <a href=\"http://wooden-clockworks.com/MLT-13.html\" target=\"_blank\">MLT-13 Clock</a> from the scrollsaw book I had, ordered and received some wood from woodcrafters and was off to the races..   The MLT-13 doesn't seem overly complex as clocks go and I had the machine and plans before I got any of the plans from Clayton so I figured I'd start with it..\n\n<a href=\"/images/2012/01/clockgears01.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"Complete Escape and 3rd Wheel Cog\" src=\"/images/2012/01/clockgears01-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Complete Escape and 3rd Wheel Cog\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Faster on the scroll saw</span></a>\n\nThe first gear I cut was the escape wheel and I did so on my bandsaw.  It was pretty rough and needed a lot of sanding and trimming in order to get it to look right.  Here you can see the second and EW finished being cut on the scroll saw once I received it.  It was much much easier to cut these things out on the scroll saw.\n\nI tried using round blades for a while but I found they were really rough in their cut and it required a lot of time to sand and smooth the backs of gears to repair all the tear outs..  I have gone to using skiptooth blades for the bigger stuff and reverse tooth blades for the small fine work.\n\n<a href=\"/images/2012/02/clockgears06.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Gear Assembly and Light\" src=\"/images/2012/02/clockgears06-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Gear Assembly and Light\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Gear Assembly and Light</span></a>\n\nIt got to the point where I was basically going blind trying to see what it was I was doing..   My eyes aren't what they used to be so I went ahead and purchased a magnifier / hobby light that I mounted to my work bench so that it would sit just above the saw..\n\nThe nice thing about this setup is that it both serves to magnify and light my work, as well as being eye protection.  I was concerned with vibration since that's a heavy light and lens out on the end of a rather spindly arm, but the dewalt has virtually zero vibration so the light doesn't move at all (except when I bump it which happens all the time..)\n\n<a href=\"/images/2012/02/clockgears14.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"Gear Test Fit!\" src=\"/images/2012/02/clockgears14-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Gear Test Fit!\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Gear Test Fit!</span></a>\n\nAs of this picture you can see that I have all the major pieces cut out and am in the fitting process..  The only thing I have left to create at this point are the hands.\n\nThere is some minor binding between my gears that I need to work out, I foresee some serious time with sandpaper ahead of me, but even so they do turn nicely if not 100% smoothly.\n\n<a href=\"/images/2012/02/clockgears11.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img

get the pendulum, pallet and escape wheel assembly to actually ticking though.   I'm still in the process of getting the clutch working correctly..\n\nThe wife and I sat down and figured out the colors..  We are going to go for a walnut for the body pieces and a cherry for the gearing.  Not sure if I want to leave any of the gears \"nude\" or not.  Three colors might be a bit too much.\n\nFor my next trick, trying to capture the elusive tick!\n\n__Update: 17 Feb 2012__\n\n<a href=\"/images/2012/02/20120217-213343.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"Recut Escape

tick!\n\nHere you can see my recut escape wheel on the left compared to the old one on the right.  I spent two days recutting this thing making sure it was as good as I could make it.\n\nI cut out the pinion and glued on (not showed in the picture) and remounted the new wheel.. it works much better.. even though the differences are minute, it makes a huge difference.\n\nI had to do some shaping on the pallets and I need to resand them as they are rough which is one problem, but some of my other gears are binding a tiny bit which means no constant tick.. but I get 8 to 10 \"ticks\" out of it before it catches or stops.\n\nI also don't have enough weight hanging off the bottom so I need to address that.. but I'm really excited.. it's so close!\n\n__Update: 3 Sep 2013__\n\n<a

height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Disassembled</span></a>\n\nI can't believe it's been so long since I started working on this thing..  It has hung on my wall silent for months and today I pulled it down and started investigating it further.  I was so close brefore but have learned a lot since then, so I wanted to give it a nother try.\n\nI found that I had done a lot of things wrong that I need to correct, and aim to do that over the course of the next week or two.  I was really close before, but it would always grind to a halt.. I'm gonna fix that..\n\n\n---\n\n\n^(1) It's interesting to note that neither \"artsy\" nor \"craftsy\" are words according to Merriam Webster, but <a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/artsy-craftsy\" target=\"_blank\">together they are a word</a>..

It's just a masterpiece..\n\n^(3) A few words about <a href=\"http://www.woodthatworks.com/kinetic-sculptures/shimmer/\" target=\"_blank\">Shimmer by David C. Roy</a>:  David has done a lot of different sculptures over the last 20+ years and the level of detail and precision he employs is nothing but impressive.  I like quite a few of his sculptures, some more than others but they are all very cool.   The thing that I like the most about shimmer though is how deceptively simple it is combined with how eye catching and even mesmerizing it is.   I wasn't kidding when I said above that it was the first one I stumbled across and that initial viewing has really stuck with me..   Many of his other works are far more complex than this one, but to me the simplicity of this one is part of it's beauty.   It's really nothing more than a spring powered escape mechanism that powers a childs optical illusion rendered in wood.  Awesome!  Well done David.\n\n","previous":{"next":{"next":{"path":"_posts/2012-02-29-dads-new-store.md","url":"/dads-new-store/","relative_path":"_posts/2012-02-29-dads-new-store.md","id":"/dads-new-store","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Hobbies"],"layout":"post","title":"My latest trip to TN and Dads new store","tags":["Wood Working"],"type":"post","published":true,"image":"/images/2012/02/shop00.jpg","allow_comments":true,"date":"2012-02-29 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"dads-new-store","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2012-02-13-scroll-saw-and-mlt-13-wooden-clock.md","output":null,"content":"<a href=\"/images/2012/02/clockgears14.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Gear Test Fit!\" src=\"/images/2012/02/clockgears14-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Gear Test Fit!\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Latest Image</span></a>\n\nI have always been a very artsy-craftsy^(1) person as I thoroughly enjoy making things.  I like working with my hands and creating something from nothing.   I've made leather and steel armor for the SCA, bows and crossbows and a mandolin that actually doesn't sound half bad.  I've done some wood turning and created all manner of pens, peppermills and even a rolling pin and I have even tried my hand at making furniture -- I'm not bad at it!   For whatever reason I seem to have a knack for crafting.\n\nSo in my time, I have worked with wood, steel, leather, plastic and various resins and agates..  The thing I have noticed is that no matter what I craft, I always seem to come back to wood.    There's something about wood that I am not sure I can put to words;  It's just easy to work with in that it's forgiving, versatile and beautiful.\n\nThe problem is no matter what I have made with wood (and there has been a lot) not any particular piece or style has ever really \"grabbed me\" as something I really enjoyed and wanted to do a lot of.\n\nMy father is an avid wood turner who cranks out pens, bowls and other awesome stuff that he sells at his own little shop and I have to admit, that's really inspiring..  He's making a living by turning a hunk of nothing, into <a href=\"http://www.tellicoturnings.com/products.html\" target=\"_blank\">something beautiful</a> that other folks want!  That's cool as hell.\n\nI tried my hand at turning for a while and it is fun but I don't know that it's \"the thing\" for me.  I like putting  a randomly shaped block or log of wood on the mandrel and shaping it into something new, but you're somewhat limited in what you can make..   I thought turning pens was fun, but those pen kits are expensive and the more I think about it the more I want to create something entirely out of wood without having to rely on some pre-made mass produced (over priced) internal kit..    I think it's one of the main reasons my father has gone to making bowls instead of the pen kits or even pepper mills..  He's creating something entirely unique that's 100% his own without any outside help..

I'm gonna fix that..\n\n\n---\n\n\n^(1) It's interesting to note that neither \"artsy\" nor \"craftsy\" are words according to Merriam Webster, but <a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/artsy-craftsy\" target=\"_blank\">together they are a word</a>.. Weird.\n\n<a href=\"/images/2012/02/Marble-Strike-by-Alain-Saintagne-1.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Marble Strike by Alain Saintagne\" src=\"/images/2012/02/Marble-Strike-by-Alain-Saintagne-1-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Marble Strike by Alain Saintagne\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Marble Strike by Alain Saintagne</span></a>\n\n^(2) A few words about <a href=\"http://lisaboyer.com/Claytonsite/marblestrikepage1.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Marble Strike by Clayton Boyer</a>:   There are a number of different iterations of this clock on the net if you look around.  All of them are cool and I would love to eventually make one of these.  To me, this clock has that almost dystopian steam punk futuristic quality to it that is just too cool.  It is easily my favorite clock of all of Claytons creations and I hope to prove to him that I am worth of purchasing the plans.\n\nCheck out this version by Alaine Saintagne of France.  Tell me that's not cool as hell!  Well done Alaine!  I could stare at this clock all day.. It's just a masterpiece..\n\n^(3) A few words about <a href=\"http://www.woodthatworks.com/kinetic-sculptures/shimmer/\" target=\"_blank\">Shimmer by David C. Roy</a>:  David has done a lot of different sculptures over the last 20+ years and the level of detail and precision he employs is nothing but impressive.  I like quite a few of his sculptures, some more than others but they are all very cool.   The thing that I like the most about shimmer though is how deceptively simple it is combined with how eye catching and even mesmerizing it is.   I wasn't kidding when I said above that it was the first one I stumbled across and that initial viewing has really stuck with me..   Many of his other works are far more complex than this one, but to me the simplicity of this one is part of it's beauty.   It's really nothing more than a spring powered escape mechanism that powers a childs optical illusion rendered in wood.  Awesome!  Well done David.\n\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2012-01-03-2011-swtor-ipad2.md","url":"/2011-swtor-ipad2/","relative_path":"_posts/2012-01-03-2011-swtor-ipad2.md","id":"/2011-swtor-ipad2","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"2011, SWTOR, and iPad2","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2012/01/2012.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2012-01-03 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"2011-swtor-ipad2","ext":".md"},"url":"/scroll-saw-and-mlt-13-wooden-clock/","relative_path":"_posts/2012-02-13-scroll-saw-and-mlt-13-wooden-clock.md","id":"/scroll-saw-and-mlt-13-wooden-clock","collection":"posts","excerpt":"I have always been a very artsy-craftsy person as I thoroughly enjoy making things.  I like working with my hands and creating something from nothing.","draft":false,"categories":["Hobbies"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Scroll Saw and MLT-13 Wooden Clock","layout":"post","tags":["Wood Working","Scroll Saw","Clock"],"image":"/images/2012/02/Marble-Strike-by-Alain-Saintagne-1.jpg","ribbon":null,"tile_size":"2x2","private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2012-02-13 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"scroll-saw-and-mlt-13-wooden-clock","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2012-01-03-2011-swtor-ipad2.md","output":null,"content":"I realize that it's been a while since I posted to my blog and it's something that I want to be better about in new year but it's very difficult for me to get excited about anything that's going on right now.   I find that I'm doing a lot of work for my company and while I enjoy that it tends to keep me from doing many of my hobbies like blogging.  2011 has been a blizzard of activity and I'm sure it will only continue into the new year.\n\nOn that note; Happy New Year everyone..\n\nI'm still very keen on creating my own custom blogging software as I posted previously and it's something that I definitely am going to get around to but its slow going.  I've been working on it about an hour each night if the time is available.\n\nBut, I have to admit I've been playing a lot of the new Star Wars game the Old Republic (the new massively multiplayer online awesomeness by Bioware) and it's really quite a lot of fun. It has problems but it's addicting and it's new, if nothing else.  It's not fantasy which is one of my biggest complaints about all the other games that are out there,  I was so fantasy-ed out that I'm glad I'm finally playing something that's space related and futuristic.  To be honest, it's actually quite good.   I have been filing bugs and and making suggestions and hopefully some of them will get listen to but honestly the game is pretty good straight out of the gate and should be a huge win for Bioware.  Blizzard should be concerned.\n\nAnd also I wanted to talk briefly about Christmas, I got an iPad2 for Christmas I have to admit it's the greatest piece of hardware I've ever had.. It's actually a lot of fun. I kind of see it as just a toy right now but the more I play with it the more I can see myriads of useful business and social applications for it.  No matter what you say, it has a lot of potential and there's a lot of really neat stuff you can do with it.   If I were to use  a single word to describe the iPad I would call it \"clever\".\n\nI've been digging around on the Internet and asking my friends about good apps for the iPad and two of them come immediately to the four as being awesome. One of them is called flipboard which basically turns all of your social media and websites and the Internet in general into a magazine that you can kind of peruse at your leasure and the other one is oddly enough, dragon dictation which does just what you'd expect;  you can just talk at your iPad and it translates everything you're saying into text (which by the way is how I'm posting this now).  It's not perfect the Dragon NaturallySpeaking solution though is better than any I've ever seen and so I can see a lot more postings coming in the future since now I can just talk to my blog.\n\nIt's definitely not perfect I have to do a little bit of filtering and word replacements but I actually think it's pretty damn good.   If anything my one complaint is that it's pretty bad about punctuation.\n","previous":{"next":{"path":"_posts/2012-01-03-2011-swtor-ipad2.md","url":"/2011-swtor-ipad2/","relative_path":"_posts/2012-01-03-2011-swtor-ipad2.md","id":"/2011-swtor-ipad2","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"2011, SWTOR, and iPad2","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2012/01/2012.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2012-01-03 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"2011-swtor-ipad2","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2011-11-03-my-own-custom-blogging-software.md","output":null,"content":"<a href=\"/images/2011/11/iframe.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Example\" src=\"/images/2011/11/iframe-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Example\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Click for Example</span></a>\n\nFinal Update:  Okay.. I owe a huge apology to the wordpress folks..  After doing a bunch of digging this isn't a wordpress bug at all, but rather a server exploit that someone used to edit a good portion of the .php files on my site in order to inject their shitty obfuscated iframe crap.  There were files that were edited completely outside the realm of wordpress, on my server that the wordpress user didn't even have access too.. So wordpress is completely off the hook!  Sorry guys.\n\nNow having said that I'm still planning on making my own blogging software for funsies.. but I am not feeling as much pressure now since I now know how to purge the iframes off and wordpress isn't to blame.\n\n\n__Update__: Click the image to the right to see the highlighted code that got injected into the site tonight.. I have no clue how it got in there and am actively taking steps to figure it out.. it's magically there one second then a refresh shows its gone..   I have tested my codebase thoroughly and I can't find it anywhere, nor can I find it in any of the javascript that is being called..  Either way,  Please don't install or run anything that you download from my site.  Note: I'm deactivating all extra plugins for the time being until I figure out whats causing this.*\n\nAs many of you know, I am very much my own special kind of nerd.  I enjoy doing many a'geeky thing that others wouldn't even dream of.  To be honest, I think all software engineers have to be a bit brain damaged just to do their job.  Recently my own affliction has been leading me down the path of writing my own blogging and content management system.\n\n\nI have used a lot of different packages over the years from full on CMS systems like Joomla and Mambo to more specific blogging solutions like Wordpress and Blogger..  They all have their good points and their bad points..  I have stuck with wordpress the longest as it most fit my need, but the more I dig into programming for wordpress the more I hate it..  I really think that wordpress needs to be rewritten from the ground up, but that's a post for a different thread..\n\nLong story short, I have decided to begin work on my very own blogging and content management system that is fully featured and professionally developed.    My ultimate goal is to make it a fully featured suite of tools that folks can install and use for their own site that has a very low bar to entry.    It should be easy to install and work seamlessly out of the box..etc..\n\nThe main reason lately that this has become an issue is that I'm tired of having folks hack/inject code into my headers and footers.   I have done everything I know to do to harden my wordpress install, yet I am still constantly fighting random crap showing up in the various theme files on the site.\n\nI hate it!\n\nIt's frustrating and not fun.  More over, if they have the ability to do that then they have the ability to inject all manner of malicious code..\n\nSo with that I'm going to begin designing and building something that can do all the work I need and take all the stuff already done (all of my wordpress blog) and convert it.. etc..\n\nGonna be a lot of work.. design will be huge, but should be good in the long run if for no other reason than something fun to do..  yes.. I see this as fun..\n\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2011-08-19-dont-buy-anything-from-ubisoft.md","url":"/dont-buy-anything-from-ubisoft/","relative_path":"_posts/2011-08-19-dont-buy-anything-from-ubisoft.md","id":"/dont-buy-anything-from-ubisoft","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Don't buy anything from Ubisoft...","layout":"post","tags":["BS","DRM","Piracy","Ubisoft"],"image":"/images/2011/08/ubisoft-no.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2011-08-19 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"dont-buy-anything-from-ubisoft","ext":".md"},"url":"/my-own-custom-blogging-software/","relative_path":"_posts/2011-11-03-my-own-custom-blogging-software.md","id":"/my-own-custom-blogging-software","collection":"posts","excerpt":"As many of you know, I am very much my own special kind of nerd.  I enjoy doing many a'geeky thing that others wouldn't even dream of.  To be honest, I think all software engineers have to be a bit brain damaged just to do their job.","draft":false,"categories":["Software Development"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"My own custom blogging software","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2011/11/iframe.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2011-11-03 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"my-own-custom-blogging-software","ext":".md"},"url":"/2011-swtor-ipad2/","relative_path":"_posts/2012-01-03-2011-swtor-ipad2.md","id":"/2011-swtor-ipad2","collection":"posts","excerpt":"I realize that it's been a while since I posted to my blog and it's something that I want to be better about in new year but it's very difficult for me to get excited about anything that's going on right now.","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"2011, SWTOR, and iPad2","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2012/01/2012.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2012-01-03 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"2011-swtor-ipad2","ext":".md"},"url":"/scroll-saw-and-mlt-13-wooden-clock/","relative_path":"_posts/2012-02-13-scroll-saw-and-mlt-13-wooden-clock.md","id":"/scroll-saw-and-mlt-13-wooden-clock","collection":"posts","excerpt":"I have always been a very artsy-craftsy person as I thoroughly enjoy making things.  I like working with my hands and creating something from nothing.","draft":false,"categories":["Hobbies"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Scroll Saw and MLT-13 Wooden Clock","layout":"post","tags":["Wood Working","Scroll Saw","Clock"],"image":"/images/2012/02/Marble-Strike-by-Alain-Saintagne-1.jpg","ribbon":null,"tile_size":"2x2","private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2012-02-13 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"scroll-saw-and-mlt-13-wooden-clock","ext":".md"}
