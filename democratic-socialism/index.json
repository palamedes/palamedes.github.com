I never published it because I was so burnt out even the thought of pushing the damn file to the server was too much.  It's a single command.   It's January of 2018 now, I'm still here and still burnt.  I'll talk more to that below.\n\nSoftware developer burnout is a real thing and it's bad.  I had always heard about it and even witnessed others go through it but I had never really experienced myself.  As such I was overly quick to dismiss it or give it lip service without really considering the true ramifications or impact of the event. \n\nI have been a software developer for over 20 years.  No kidding, a long time to be sure.  And I have some how managed to avoid burnout until last year.   I'm sure every industry has some version of developer burnout but with folks in software it's extremely bad, and it takes months if not years to come back.. if they ever do.  It's taken me months to even consider it...\n\nI may not go back.  Honestly at this point I'm looking forward to law enforcement again, but that's a different story.\n\nAnyone can burn out.  From a high end CEO, to a software developer, to a person that digs ditches every day.  Burnout seems to happen when someone does a thing over and over for long periods of time without getting any real joy out of it.  Or without having a sense of accomplishment.  This is what happened to me.\n\nAnd I didn't even realize it until it was too late!\n\nI worked for years for one company or another developing software large and small.  I liked it.  I really enjoyed being an individual contributor that went to work every day creating something that people would use.  \n\nI'll be the first to admit I stayed way too long at IBM, and that by the 6th year mark I was thoroughly done but that was a management issue.  Not the job.   I still loved the job.   (People quit managers, not jobs..  keep that in mind, to that end I still feel bad about yelling at John the way I did.. Where ever you are John, I'm still very regreful and I hope you can one day forgive me for being an idiot.)\n\nThat all kinda changed about mid way through my life at Grok. \n\nGrok Interactive is a small services company that I started with a friend from a previous company and it went really well.  (The company is still going strong, I'm just not there any more for my own sanity reasons =)\n\nI just got to the point where I really didn't enjoy any aspect of the work and I needed out.  Eventually that out came and I ran for the hills!\n\n---  Continued 8 months later!\n\nwhoa.. I forgot I had started this post.  I was actually going to bring up my blog and type this post when I saw it in my queue of stuff to publish..  yes.. yes and double yes.. all of the above is still true.  I'm still crispy about software and at this point my knowledge has almost completely perished.   I have a lot of code I could go back and look at and I'm sure I could bring myself back up to speed but it would have to be on my own terms.  I think my days of working for other software firms as a paid employee in any capacity is over.\n\nRight now I'm working as a Deputy Sheriff for a small county here in North Georgia and I'm enjoying it for the most part.  I still dream about doing stuff in the software field though.  I think of problems and dream up solutions.  I have a couple back burner thoughts that I might try to field test too.  \n\nI will be updating my blog again going forward and I'm playing with some othe software projects too again.. so maybe there's still hope.","previous":{"path":"_posts/2016-12-01-out-of-time.md","url":"/out-of-time/","relative_path":"_posts/2016-12-01-out-of-time.md","id":"/out-of-time","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Out of time, Site Future Plans, Life Goals, Etc..","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2016/out-of-time.jpg","gallery":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"tile_class":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"duration":null,"costs":null,"date":"2016-12-01 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"out-of-time","ext":".md"},"url":"/developer-burnout/","relative_path":"_posts/2017-05-15-developer-burnout.md","id":"/developer-burnout","collection":"posts","excerpt":"I'm sure every industry has some version of developer burnout but with folks in software it's extremely bad, and it takes months if not years to come back.. if they ever do.","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Software Developer Burnout...

Time for me to talk about how I never post any more and how I have no time.  Life is super busy, I'm doing too many things, I need to find time..etc.. \n\nFeh.. These are all lies.  Mostly, I think I'm just really wanting to do something else..  I get into these weird moods where nothing is right and everything looks old/boring..etc.  Really this is just an excuse and a sign that something larger is at issue.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm still going to ponder redoing this site.. 'cause that's the kind of brain damaged I am but a lot more is going on.  \n\nA couple months ago I sold off my half of my ownership in a software company and honestly, it was past time.   In a weird way I'm still coming to terms with it, but mostly because I still don't know what I want to be when I grow up. \n\nWhen you have worked in software for over twenty years, it's hard to do something else.   A clean break seems impossible, but at the same time seems like the only way to move forward.  \n\nGrok was great and it was a good experience over all but I want to do my own thing, and I want to do other things.   I got into software professionally in the early 1990's and almost did it on a lark.  Originally programming was a hobby that was all funzies and joy..  The important lesson I learned was, once you turn a hobby into a career, you lose the hobby and it becomes work.\n\nI'm to the point now that the notion of going back into software as a professional developer (even as an individual contributor instead of management) is completely distasteful.  Sure the money is great, but the level of anxiety and sense of misery is palpable.  I just can't bring myself to do it. \n\nI still like the idea of writing my own software and doing something very passively that might make money or might not just as an \"out\" or as something fun to do in my spare time though.  Very much back to my original \"hobby\" status with programming.  But professionally?  Nope.  I think I'm done there.\n\nI've pondered doing some stuff with the airplane build that makes it more of a tutorial site where others can comment and give input on how to build a plane.  Sort of a community documentation site.  I have to ponder this.  But the idea would be to make it so that each step in the plans would be it's own page with a video or documentation on how to do the work.  Almost an interactive crowd sourced project where people can talk / discuss and even comment directly on the plans and steps in a virtual space.   I have reached out to Scott Risan at Van's Aircraft to see if this is something they would support or veto.  No response yet. \n\nI'm going to make a video to my patreons about this and see what they think.\n\n### Other things on my list of \"shit to do\";\n\n_I want to redesign the blog_ \nBut not necessarily a full visual redesign, but more of a \"bring it up to currency\" with regards to be backend deployment software.  It's been ages since I have updated my Jekyll install and I'm STILL using LESS.  That needs to be rectified.  \n\n","previous":{"next":{"path":"_posts/2016-12-01-out-of-time.md","url":"/out-of-time/","relative_path":"_posts/2016-12-01-out-of-time.md","id":"/out-of-time","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Out of time, Site Future Plans, Life Goals, Etc..","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2016/out-of-time.jpg","gallery":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"tile_class":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"duration":null,"costs":null,"date":"2016-12-01 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"out-of-time","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2016-02-29-democratic-socialism.md","output":null,"content":"<img src='/images/2016/socialism.png' class='right scaled' />\n\nIt seems like a lot of America's young people (commonly referred to millennials) love the notion of Socialism.  They color it by saying it's \"Democratic Socialism\" (\"DS\" going forward) which is sorta the same thing and not good -- Bear with me here.  \n\nTrue democratic socialists believe that a socialist state can be achieved through democratic means.  I don't believe that's what these folks are going for.  It would be far better for these people to refer to themselves as Social Democrats because then at least that says they aim to modify the harshness of capitalism with the infusion of some elements of socialism which I believe to be closer to their true aim.   But so far all of the millennials I have talked to that are pro the \"DS\" idea's call themselves democratic socialists, not social democrats.  May seem like a minor quibble all things considered but language matters.\n\n## To those people I'd like to say the following;   \n\nFirstly, and foremost; I appreciate that you have a political view.  That’s a good thing.  I know a lot of people my age, who at your age had no political views what-so-ever and happily let the government do whatever it wanted.  You're not doing that.  Good for you!  Take a stand in what you believe in.. Hell yeah.. that’s what America is all about!  I very much appreciate your attempts to better the country where my generation was a little less caring about it. \n\nHaving said that, in my opinion, there is a distinct dichotomy between being for \"DS\" but against the government doing something it feels is in your best interest. I'm specifically referring to the FBI wanting to add backdoors to iphones \"for your own good\".  It's good they oppose that, but it seems to be a direct contradiction to the \"DS\" mentality -- but that's an aside.\n\n## \"Democracy is the road to Socialism\"&#185;\n\nI'd also like to point out that the United States of America isn't a democracy.  We live in a constitutional republic, and while the line between democracy and republic is a fine one -- it's an important one.  Primarily because a constitutional republic is the road to freedom, and a democracy is the road to socialism.  \n\nSo with that, I have some serious concerns with “Democratic Socialism”.  Mostly that by its very nature it imbues the government with MORE power.  It strikes me as away by the citizens to eschew responsibility to the government and basically implies that you trust the government to take care of your needs.   History is replete with examples of why this is a bad idea.\n\n## \"The road to Hell is paved with good intentions\"&#178;\n\nDemocratic Socialism is a white wash of socialism.  Most non-democratic societies love to throw the word “democratic” into the language to describe what they are doing just to muddy the water, to confused and befuddle the proletariat into thinking that they had some choice or input on the matter.  They often don't.   I mean what exactly is democratic about the DPRK?  \n    \n## \"Men make their own history, but they do not make it as they please\"&#179;\n    \nAs to the United States; it really seems like people have forgotten that the US government has a primary job of national defense.   Giving the government more and more power, which is what democratic socialists are trying to do, will only encourage the tyrannical shift that many governments in the past have made.  History doomed to repeat itself.  \n\n<hr />\n\n<img src='/images/2016/dangers-socialism.png' class='left' />\n### Dangers of Socialism\n\n\"DS\" or just Socialism in general has a lot of dangers to it;\n  \n#### It rewards people for being irresponsible, indolent and for being unaccountable for their own actions\n\nIn an environment where you aren't responsible to produce, what stops you from being a complete lazy slob that can just hold your hand out and demand compensation?  Nothing.  In this environment people will demand more and more for doing less and less.  We already see this today and it will only get worse. \n\nThis system actively rewards people for being indolent and promotes indolence by de-incentivizing, robbing of initiative, drive and ambition those that produce anything because they have the fruits of their labor effectively stolen from them to perpetuate those that don’t.  \"DS\" not only allows for and legalizes theft but actively promotes it in the name of redistributing wealth.\n\n\n#### It de-incentivizes those that do produce, robbing them of not only the fruits of their labor but the initiative to produce in the first place\n\nThose that do produce things will be less and less likely to do so over time because they will see the individual who did nothing rewarded for doing nothing with the very fruits the producer should have gotten.  The notion that people will continue to produce happily for the sake of production is a flawed one due to the nature of Humans.  The Mark 1.0 Human being simply doesn't work that way.\n\n\n#### It rationalizes theft, penalizes accomplishment and does away with individual rights for the sake of the \"public good\"\n\nIf you're taking away from the person who produced in order to give it to the person who didn't, then you're not only penalizing the producer and de-incentivizing that production, but you're stealing from that individual who produced to give to those that didn't.   You can't encourage people to do more by first stealing from them.  You can't multiply production by first dividing it.  And you can't encourage those who do nothing to start being a productive member of society if you are giving them hand outs.  Again, Human nature.\n\nThis means that it completely undermines any spirit of entrepreneurship, innovation and competitiveness and actively promotes totalitarianism by encouraging people to be self-indulgent instead of self reliant.\n   \nThis also means that the rights of the worker will go out the window in favor of the public good and control by the state.\n\n#### It actively promotes obedience to the state, idealizes state power and encourages dependence on the state\n\nThis is where the real issue is;  The more the government squeezes and takes with intent to distribute to those who don't have, the more people will become dependant on that handout.   The more we go down the \"DS\" hole, the deeper people will get and the more people will rely on the government.  It’s a vicious cycle.  Think of where that will end..  By it’s very nature it can’t stop with just social programs like people think.  \n\nThe “democratic” aspect of it means people are willingly giving their own freedoms up without fully exploring where this could go.\n\n\n### But the Scandinavian democratic socialists managed it!\n\nmmmm, no they didn't.  \n\n_“I know that some people in the US associate the Nordic model with some sort of socialism. Therefore I would like to make one thing clear. Denmark is far from a socialist planned economy. Denmark is a market economy.”_  -- Prime Minister of Denmark at a speech at the Harvard Institute of Politics.\n\nCountries that already do this are pure consumer economies some with over 50% unemployment and over 80% taxation.\n\n## To sum up with Pro's and Con's\n\nWhat would it mean for a true socialist democratic solution in the US?\n\n## Con's:\n - Taxes would go up - A lot to cover all the new spending\n - Unemployment would go up - A lot because people don't have to work\n - Productivity would go down - A lot because people will be de-incentivized\n - People would be reliant on the government\n - Gives government much more (if not full) control\n - Rights of workers go out the window\n \n## Pro's:\n - Income inequality would go down - Unfair to those who product\n - Free benefits would go up - Not really free at all due to high taxes\n - Promotes a classless society - Rich and Poor gap will narrow drastically, again unfair to those who produced and earned\n\n&#185;,&#178;,&#179; : Finally, if you agree with any of the quoted headers above then you agree with Carl Marx and his Communist Manifesto as they are direct quotes from the man -- this would be a good time to rethink your position.  National Socialism (Hitler), Marxist Socialism (Communism), and Democratic Socialism are different, but not vastly so.  More over \"DS\" can include forms of Marxism and even Anarchism.  I feel modern pro \"DS\" individuals are taking more of a Marxist tack than they realize.\n\nAlso, keep in mind, governments ultimately enforce everything with a gun.  I feel that this socialism road people are trying to take us down will have a very bad ending...\n\n<hr/>\n\nAdditional -- I think this is a pretty good viewing and worth watching all of it: \n\n<iframe width=\"920\" height=\"540\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/D0Yp1jUtcX8\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","previous":{"path":"_posts/2015-08-18-livable-wages-unreasonable-expectations.md","url":"/livable-wages-unreasonable-expectations/","relative_path":"_posts/2015-08-18-livable-wages-unreasonable-expectations.md","id":"/livable-wages-unreasonable-expectations","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Software Development"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Livable Wages and Unreasonable Client Expectations","layout":"post","tags":["Business"],"image":"/images/2015/08/greed.jpg","gallery":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"tile_class":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"duration":null,"costs":null,"date":"2015-08-18 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"livable-wages-unreasonable-expectations","ext":".md"},"url":"/democratic-socialism/","relative_path":"_posts/2016-02-29-democratic-socialism.md","id":"/democratic-socialism","collection":"posts","excerpt":"I feel that this socialism road people are trying to take us down will have a very bad ending...","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Democratic Socialism","layout":"post","tags":["Democratic Socialism"],"image":"/images/2016/socialism.png","gallery":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"tile_class":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"duration":null,"costs":null,"date":"2016-02-29 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"democratic-socialism","ext":".md"},"url":"/out-of-time/","relative_path":"_posts/2016-12-01-out-of-time.md","id":"/out-of-time","collection":"posts","excerpt":"Well, it's that time again.

They color it by saying it's \"Democratic Socialism\" (\"DS\" going forward) which is sorta the same thing and not good -- Bear with me here.  \n\nTrue democratic socialists believe that a socialist state can be achieved through democratic means.  I don't believe that's what these folks are going for.  It would be far better for these people to refer to themselves as Social Democrats because then at least that says they aim to modify the harshness of capitalism with the infusion of some elements of socialism which I believe to be closer to their true aim.   But so far all of the millennials I have talked to that are pro the \"DS\" idea's call themselves democratic socialists, not social democrats.  May seem like a minor quibble all things considered but language matters.\n\n## To those people I'd like to say the following;   \n\nFirstly, and foremost; I appreciate that you have a political view.  That’s a good thing.  I know a lot of people my age, who at your age had no political views what-so-ever and happily let the government do whatever it wanted.  You're not doing that.  Good for you!  Take a stand in what you believe in.. Hell yeah.. that’s what America is all about!  I very much appreciate your attempts to better the country where my generation was a little less caring about it. \n\nHaving said that, in my opinion, there is a distinct dichotomy between being for \"DS\" but against the government doing something it feels is in your best interest. I'm specifically referring to the FBI wanting to add backdoors to iphones \"for your own good\".  It's good they oppose that, but it seems to be a direct contradiction to the \"DS\" mentality -- but that's an aside.\n\n## \"Democracy is the road to Socialism\"&#185;\n\nI'd also like to point out that the United States of America isn't a democracy.  We live in a constitutional republic, and while the line between democracy and republic is a fine one -- it's an important one.  Primarily because a constitutional republic is the road to freedom, and a democracy is the road to socialism.  \n\nSo with that, I have some serious concerns with “Democratic Socialism”.  Mostly that by its very nature it imbues the government with MORE power.  It strikes me as away by the citizens to eschew responsibility to the government and basically implies that you trust the government to take care of your needs.   History is replete with examples of why this is a bad idea.\n\n## \"The road to Hell is paved with good intentions\"&#178;\n\nDemocratic Socialism is a white wash of socialism.  Most non-democratic societies love to throw the word “democratic” into the language to describe what they are doing just to muddy the water, to confused and befuddle the proletariat into thinking that they had some choice or input on the matter.  They often don't.   I mean what exactly is democratic about the DPRK?  \n    \n## \"Men make their own history, but they do not make it as they please\"&#179;\n    \nAs to the United States; it really seems like people have forgotten that the US government has a primary job of national defense.   Giving the government more and more power, which is what democratic socialists are trying to do, will only encourage the tyrannical shift that many governments in the past have made.  History doomed to repeat itself.  \n\n<hr />\n\n<img src='/images/2016/dangers-socialism.png' class='left' />\n### Dangers of Socialism\n\n\"DS\" or just Socialism in general has a lot of dangers to it;\n  \n#### It rewards people for being irresponsible, indolent and for being unaccountable for their own actions\n\nIn an environment where you aren't responsible to produce, what stops you from being a complete lazy slob that can just hold your hand out and demand compensation?  Nothing.  In this environment people will demand more and more for doing less and less.  We already see this today and it will only get worse. \n\nThis system actively rewards people for being indolent and promotes indolence by de-incentivizing, robbing of initiative, drive and ambition those that produce anything because they have the fruits of their labor effectively stolen from them to perpetuate those that don’t.  \"DS\" not only allows for and legalizes theft but actively promotes it in the name of redistributing wealth.\n\n\n#### It de-incentivizes those that do produce, robbing them of not only the fruits of their labor but the initiative to produce in the first place\n\nThose that do produce things will be less and less likely to do so over time because they will see the individual who did nothing rewarded for doing nothing with the very fruits the producer should have gotten.  The notion that people will continue to produce happily for the sake of production is a flawed one due to the nature of Humans.  The Mark 1.0 Human being simply doesn't work that way.\n\n\n#### It rationalizes theft, penalizes accomplishment and does away with individual rights for the sake of the \"public good\"\n\nIf you're taking away from the person who produced in order to give it to the person who didn't, then you're not only penalizing the producer and de-incentivizing that production, but you're stealing from that individual who produced to give to those that didn't.   You can't encourage people to do more by first stealing from them.  You can't multiply production by first dividing it.  And you can't encourage those who do nothing to start being a productive member of society if you are giving them hand outs.  Again, Human nature.\n\nThis means that it completely undermines any spirit of entrepreneurship, innovation and competitiveness and actively promotes totalitarianism by encouraging people to be self-indulgent instead of self reliant.\n   \nThis also means that the rights of the worker will go out the window in favor of the public good and control by the state.\n\n#### It actively promotes obedience to the state, idealizes state power and encourages dependence on the state\n\nThis is where the real issue is;  The more the government squeezes and takes with intent to distribute to those who don't have, the more people will become dependant on that handout.   The more we go down the \"DS\" hole, the deeper people will get and the more people will rely on the government.  It’s a vicious cycle.  Think of where that will end..  By it’s very nature it can’t stop with just social programs like people think.  \n\nThe “democratic” aspect of it means people are willingly giving their own freedoms up without fully exploring where this could go.\n\n\n### But the Scandinavian democratic socialists managed it!\n\nmmmm, no they didn't.  \n\n_“I know that some people in the US associate the Nordic model with some sort of socialism. Therefore I would like to make one thing clear. Denmark is far from a socialist planned economy. Denmark is a market economy.”_  -- Prime Minister of Denmark at a speech at the Harvard Institute of Politics.\n\nCountries that already do this are pure consumer economies some with over 50% unemployment and over 80% taxation.\n\n## To sum up with Pro's and Con's\n\nWhat would it mean for a true socialist democratic solution in the US?\n\n## Con's:\n - Taxes would go up - A lot to cover all the new spending\n - Unemployment would go up - A lot because people don't have to work\n - Productivity would go down - A lot because people will be de-incentivized\n - People would be reliant on the government\n - Gives government much more (if not full) control\n - Rights of workers go out the window\n \n## Pro's:\n - Income inequality would go down - Unfair to those who product\n - Free benefits would go up - Not really free at all due to high taxes\n - Promotes a classless society - Rich and Poor gap will narrow drastically, again unfair to those who produced and earned\n\n&#185;,&#178;,&#179; : Finally, if you agree with any of the quoted headers above then you agree with Carl Marx and his Communist Manifesto as they are direct quotes from the man -- this would be a good time to rethink your position.  National Socialism (Hitler), Marxist Socialism (Communism), and Democratic Socialism are different, but not vastly so.  More over \"DS\" can include forms of Marxism and even Anarchism.  I feel modern pro \"DS\" individuals are taking more of a Marxist tack than they realize.\n\nAlso, keep in mind, governments ultimately enforce everything with a gun.  I feel that this socialism road people are trying to take us down will have a very bad ending...\n\n<hr/>\n\nAdditional -- I think this is a pretty good viewing and worth watching all of it: \n\n<iframe width=\"920\" height=\"540\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/D0Yp1jUtcX8\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","previous":{"path":"_posts/2015-08-18-livable-wages-unreasonable-expectations.md","url":"/livable-wages-unreasonable-expectations/","relative_path":"_posts/2015-08-18-livable-wages-unreasonable-expectations.md","id":"/livable-wages-unreasonable-expectations","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Software Development"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Livable Wages and Unreasonable Client Expectations","layout":"post","tags":["Business"],"image":"/images/2015/08/greed.jpg","gallery":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"tile_class":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"duration":null,"costs":null,"date":"2015-08-18 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"livable-wages-unreasonable-expectations","ext":".md"},"url":"/democratic-socialism/","relative_path":"_posts/2016-02-29-democratic-socialism.md","id":"/democratic-socialism","collection":"posts","excerpt":"I feel that this socialism road people are trying to take us down will have a very bad ending...","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Democratic Socialism","layout":"post","tags":["Democratic Socialism"],"image":"/images/2016/socialism.png","gallery":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"tile_class":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"duration":null,"costs":null,"date":"2016-02-29 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"democratic-socialism","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2015-08-18-livable-wages-unreasonable-expectations.md","output":null,"content":"<img src='/images/2015/08/greed.jpg' class='right' /> \n\nI don’t work at a fast food restaurant, a pizza delivery joint, or behind the counter at a gas station.  In fact, I don’t work at any job that is minimum wage or there abouts because in my opinion, it’s not a livable wage.  And, to be completely honest, I don’t understand how people manage to live on so little income.\n\nInstead, I chose a career path that requires a lot of technical knowledge and skill in order to stay competitive in the industry and that pays well enough that I can continue to live the lifestyle I enjoy.\n\nPart of my job is to entertain offers for work from prospective clients. This typically includes hours (often days) of communication, information gathering, research, and other unbillable time that I have to put in for them before I get paid a dime.\n\nThe ultimate goal of which is to divide up the work with the intent of putting hourly and iterative work totals to their software desire which gives them a cost estimate for the work they want done.   \n\nThis is the only part of my job I hate.  I hate it because all clients want the sky, the moon, and stars -- for free or very little money and scoff and demand to know why we are “so expensive”.  \n\nWe aren’t - In fact I know a lot of firms that charge a lot more than we do.  We are realistic.\n\nAn example prospective client hit us up today with a 20 page document (small type!) full of all the requirements that had to be met in order for us to be complete, had less than 3 months to do the work, and wanted the whole shebang for $10,000.   All the while bemoaning the previous developers that offered to do the work for that amount but who were unresponsive. \n\n(I will admit that having such thorough document to talk to is great!  Many clients show up with nothing but a dream only to have their hopes dashed when we start asking hard questions that they don’t have answers to.  Define your product, or we can help you define it.  But if I define it, it will be an MVP/POC first and iterate into a full blown product.  This is a topic for a different post though.)\n\nBut the common thread is that no matter the scope of the work, they always think we are too expensive and quite often expect to pay less than half or even a quarter of what is reasonable. \n\nFor example; The $10k job above would have required at least two full time developers to get it done within the 3 month deadline, if it’s even possible to make the deadline without working a lot of overtime.  But assuming its possible to get it done in the time allotted; $10k divided by roughly 60 days, at 8 hours a day, for 2 developers ends up being just above $10 an hour over the life of the project and that’s before taxes.  \n\nNot a livable wage.  A plumber makes more.\n\nI didn’t spend the last 20+ years getting experience in my industry and spending an unconscionable amount of extra time becoming an expert to work for so little. It requires a lot of time, effort and energy on my part to stay current and competitive in my industry so I have very little patience with people who think I get paid too much money for what I do. \n\nSorry, but anyone who says software engineers and architects get paid too much, don’t understand what it takes to do what we do.\n\nI think the issue is most people just see the initial number and think it’s a lot.   On the surface, $10k is a lot of money.  And if I were given $10k for doing nothing then I’d be happy as a clam.\n\nMost people have no concept the amount of work, time, and effort that goes into writing software and as such they can’t really fathom it.  Because they can’t wrap their mind around it and because there is nothing physical to put value to, it’s very easy to think that they are paying us that $10k for nothing and that we should be just happy as a clam for being offered it.\n\nIt pains me to have to be the one to explain to them that this isn’t the case.  The problem comes when you have those people that are actually offended by the amount I say it would actually require in order to pull their dream off.   I’m usually looked at as a greedy bastard and thought of as a criminal.\n\nMost firms would charge closer to $100k for that 3 month job.  See what I mean?  You scoffed a little didn’t you.\n\nAnd I’m just talking about the initial development cost.  Not maintenance fees, server hardware, data storage fees, design costs, testing costs etc..  \n\nThe problem with going with the $10k firm versus the $100k firm is that you get what you pay for.  The perceived value is in dollars only, without any thought or consideration to the quality of the work being done or the support you’re going to get before start, during development and after completion. \n\nThey have already approached $10k firm for the product and they don’t like the support / communication they were getting (read: the firm has just disappeared because 10k for this project is too low), so why are they looking for another $10k firm that will likely give them the exact same results?  \n\nYou get what you pay for and people some how refuse to learn that lesson with software.  \n\n","previous":{"next":{"path":"_posts/2015-08-18-livable-wages-unreasonable-expectations.md","url":"/livable-wages-unreasonable-expectations/","relative_path":"_posts/2015-08-18-livable-wages-unreasonable-expectations.md","id":"/livable-wages-unreasonable-expectations","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Software Development"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Livable Wages and Unreasonable Client Expectations","layout":"post","tags":["Business"],"image":"/images/2015/08/greed.jpg","gallery":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"tile_class":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"duration":null,"costs":null,"date":"2015-08-18 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"livable-wages-unreasonable-expectations","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2015-02-07-modifying-jekyll.md","output":null,"content":"I love being a programmer.  It's one of those things that I truly enjoy and get a real sense of accomplish out of when I can make something work the way I want it to.\n\nI switched to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) as my primary blogging system a [while back](http://randomstringofwords.com/blogging-like-its-1999/) and haven't looked back.  It's been great.  Just like my early post says; Blogging like it's 1999!  Each page is built as raw html and then pushed to the servers.  Fast, secure, easy.  \n   \nBut I wanted to add a special post type \"build-log\" to my blog so that I could write all about my RV-10 build experience and have it track just like any other blog, but in a different directory structure.  This would be basically a blog, within a blog.  \n\nI started writing said plugin and it got pretty massive.  I was basically having to re-architecture/re-factor all of Jekyll to make it happen and that was just not going to fly.  It wouldn't be performant, it would have to be forward/backwards compatible and in the long run maintaining it would suck.\n\nSO I cheated.\n\nI simply deleted the plugin ( and the probably hundred hours I put into making it ) and started a new Jekyll blog for the build log, using all the same views as the main blog.  \n\nI then had the build log blog output to a directory structure nested within the main blog.  This forced me to go in and move all the files down one directory once it was build but I have a script now that will do it all for me!    Ding!  I get two complete blogs within one another that are stored in different repo's and build into a single blog.  Easy!\n\nJekyll..
