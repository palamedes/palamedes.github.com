(of a character similar to crimes against humanity).. of enforcing racial segregation...   against an already segregated people..  in South Africa..  Hrmmm If only there were a cogent paradigm..\n\n\"Down with the aliens!!  Keep those Kaffer's .. er I mean 'Prawns' out of our towns!\"  Okay got it.. Apartheid is bad.. No shit.. uh..  Wasn't it outlawed back in the early 90's for exactly that reason?  Oh they aren't from Earth so it's okay..  Feh..\n\nAll during this process the movie is just dragging ass..  Shot from a \"news footage\" point of view you have to watch people beat, humiliate, torture and even kill the prawns (the offensive and ONLY name given to the alien race) just 'cause they are aliens, for a good .. long .. while .. from shaky cam news footage style..  (many times in places that it made no sense to shoot it that way as there wouldn't be a camera there..)   Simply put,  this part of the movie was horribly dark and depressing, and just too long..\n\nIt was so long that one guy got up and left the theatre..   We were at <a href=\"http://www.drafthouse.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Alamo Drafthouse</a>, where they serve beer and food while you watch the movie, and this guy bailed.. it was that hard to watch..  They really didn't develop the aliens characters overly much either..\n\nAll of the prawns are portrayed as these loathsome scavengers, locked in this multi-block enclosure where they had been for 20 years whom behave in disgusting alien ways..  As such it really evokes zero sympathy for them..  We really learned nothing about them as a race of people, why they were here, how they interact with each other, their children, us etc.. and you were given the impression we weren't supposed to care..   Thus the focus seems to be on the dork and abusing the prawns..\n\nIn all likelihood it actually didn't go on that long, but it sure as hell seemed like it..\n\nEventually the happy go-lucky dork gets infected by the magical mystical goo that the aliens had been struggling for 20 years to acquire/create and slowly starts transforming into a prawn.   The dork got the goo from the friend of the main protagonist prawn who in the next scene has his brains blown out.. (assuming he keeps his brains in his head.. )\n\nWe know nothing about this goo other than it's bad for humans, it's impossibly hard to create, and apparently a couple drops will power a space ship the size of a city across a galaxy..   Huge holes around the goo, but fine.. cheap plot device -- the aliens struggled for 20 years to create it -- its very important to them in that it powers their ship and is the reason they are stuck here -- it turns humans into prawns -- and is now in the hands of the humans.\n\nSuddenly due to the infection the dork has his entire life stripped away from him; his hot wife, his new job, his dorky identity.. he's portrayed to the media as this highly contagious alien fornicator (prawn fucker) and is on the run from the law.. There is only one place he can go!  Guess where.. Go ahead and guess..\n\nYou even have other painful cliche characters like;\n\n* The overzealous military guy who just loves pulling the wings off flies..\n* The innocent and way too hot wife of the dork who loves her man.. is mad at her man.. wants nothing to do with her man.. no no wait.. she forgives him.. loves her man again..\n* The gun running, drug doing, voodoo gang over lord who you just know will cause all manner of trouble.. for no good reason other than \"you had your chance, its my turn to have the power now..\"\n* The token black guy being trained for the dorks job and was the only guy on the team that was specifically not given a kevlar vest to wearing. \"Don't worry about it.. wear this red shirt instead..\"\n* And of course.. the evil father-in-law that secretly had been running covert body snatcher like biological experiments on the prawns all along and now was going to have the newly infected son-in-law killed because his organization needs his DNA in order to be able to use the alien weapons..   wait.. what?!\n\nI mean seriously it's painfully obvious where it's going to go.. It just took a long time to get there..  He slowly learns the errors of his ways and decides to help the main protagonist prawn get his prawny son, two characters we really knew very little about but who in the end are more humane than we are, to the mother ship before ultimately turning into a prawn himself.\n\nSo.. The dork, who at this point is half turning into an alien gathers up alien and human weapons by force from the gun running voodoo guy and storms the organizations compound in order to get the goo back, all the while the gun running voodoo guy is threatening revenge..\n\nAnd so begins the running fire fight which would be the new mode of the movie from here on out..\n\nSuddenly the part of Peter Jackson is played by Micheal Bay.. And we are rewarded for our sticking out the \"message\" portion of the movie with lots of bullets and explosions -- and of course some of the best CG \"mech\" porn I have seen in a long time... in fact.. ever..\n\nReally I can simply describe everything from this point on as a constant running firefight with the main dork redeeming himself by killing everyone from the inside of an extremely well done CG mech.\n\nThe movie itself looks sort of like black hawk down with aliens..  The attention to detail everywhere was actually pretty darn good..  The aliens looked great!  And the special effects for the alien weaponry, especially the mech was very well done.  I was less impressed by the ships.. but what can ya do..\n\nThe dork, now hero, escorts the main prawn protagonist as far as he can,  even going as far as to say \"go on without me, don't make my sacrifice for nothing..\"\n\nThe prawn says, with a black tear in his eye, \"I'll be back in three years.. I promise..\"  Then turns and runs to the ship while the dork/hero continues to fight on.  He eventually gets to the ship, takes off.. and flies away.\n\nThe dork/hero's mech finally is destroyed -- opens up and coughs the hero out as it colapses into a heap and of course the cliche military guy comes up and gives a nice monolog about how he will enjoy killing the dork/hero..  Which never happens because all the rest of the prawns run up and rip him to shreds..\n\nThe end.\n\nOr is it?  The last thing we see is confirmation that the dork/hero has turned fully into a prawn and we know that all the prawns left on Earth have been moved from district 9 to district 10..   I'm pretty damned sure there was some foreshadowing being hammered into us here too..  The \"3 years\" number was thrown around quite a lot.. and moving them from District 9 to District 10 seemed obvious... etc..\n\nThe movie had gaping plot holes.. Completely underdeveloped or not even remotely developed main characters..  It had a horrible and down right offensive message that was delivered in quite possibly the worst way.. And really had very few redeeming qualities..  I seriously hope they don't make a sequel.. However, if they do it would almost have to be better than the first one..\n\nSo having said that;  I kind of liked it..  The visuals were good candy, and I do like my candy but the rest of it kind of hurt..\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2009-08-14-28-hdmi-monitor.md","url":"/28-hdmi-monitor/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-08-14-28-hdmi-monitor.md","id":"/28-hdmi-monitor","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"28\" HDMI Monitor","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2009/08/monitor-150x150.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-08-14 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"28-hdmi-monitor","ext":".md"},"url":"/movie-review-district-9/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-08-15-movie-review-district-9.md","id":"/movie-review-district-9","collection":"posts","excerpt":"My initial reaction to District 9, upon the movie ending was to say -- and I quote; \"What the fuck was that?!\"  I sort of felt like my soul had just been raped, and I was just beginning to feel the crush of information as I processed the movie I had just watched..","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Movie Review: District 9","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2009/08/district9-poster-200x300.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-08-15 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"movie-review-district-9","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2009-08-14-28-hdmi-monitor.md","output":null,"content":"<img title=\"Huge Monitor\" src=\"/images/2009/08/monitor-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Huge Monitor\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" class='pull-right' />\n\nSo Tigerdirect was having a hell of a deal on something I have sorta wanted for  a while...   I have been playing games, programming, and generally tooling around on a 20\" wide screen monitor for years now.\n\nMy old 20\" wide screen viewsonic worked great to be sure..  I really liked it and when I moved it from my old 17\" square monitor I thought I had found eden..   Well let me tellya..

open beta that I feel I can safely talk about the game without giving anything important away -- or at the very least I think I'm safe from being sued..  (Please don't sue me..)\n\nI have been in the Champions Online closed beta pretty much since day one and I can say without much hesitation that the game is not horrible. In fact I would go as far as to say its pretty good and appears to be getting better with each patch..\n\nI certainly can say that as the beta has progressed the game has gotten Waaaaayy better and will very likely continue to do so for a good while yet..  And I can further say that it's good enough for me to actually purchase and play the game after release, but there are issues I hope get solved..\n\nFrom day 1 when I started in the beta I had extremely high hopes.   Extremely high..  Like.. Too high.. heh\n\nI wanted Champions online to be exactly what Champions is;  a \"sky is the limit\" paper and pencil role playing game where the player can create any kind of hero they want and effectively play within the realm of the GM's imagination..   If you as a player could imagine it,  then you could do it!  Booyah baby!\n\nI pretty much had the same hopes for City of Heroes previously and of course was let down for many of the same reasons which I'll get to..  (Note;  I liked City of Heroes and played it for a good long time but it never had the freedom and versatility that it had originally promised. )\n\nChampions Online suffers from this exact same issue -- our expectations are too high.  It's completely unrealistic to think that they could create a game where players could be ANYTHING..  I mean how do you even create the framework that can encompass a whole generation of players imaginations?!  Powers, Abilities, Costumes.. etc   You can't.. Period.. There's just no way..\n\nThis problem isn't really a problem, it's a matter of the player needing to lower their expectations a tad..   But they did call their game \"Champions\" online so of course that makes people hope for just such a thing..\n\nSo instead of trying they went the same route that they had used with City of Heroes, which is a good thing to be honest.\n\nWhat they did was to limit everything down to a set or subset of powers that you can choose from when building your super hero.  They do the same thing with costumes in that there are a finite number of elements you can choose from.\n\nIn City of Heroes you could spend days just playing with the character creator designing your hero.. Not powers or attributes, but just creating what your hero looks like.  Multiply that by a factor of 4 and you have the new character creator.  It's quite nice in that you can create just about anything.    I had a lot of fun tooling around in the character generator and made all manner of silly to serious characters.  The creator had some bugs of course, its still early in development, but it was still pretty neat.\n\nThe power sets right now seem somewhat limited..  I wish/want there to be way more powers.. I also was under the impression that we would have more control over what powers looked like..  I swear I read somewhere that you could have the same \"blast\" power that someone else had, but you could control what it graphically looks like or what color it was etc.. and that's not the case..  In some cases you can control where the power originates (hands, head, chest..etc) but that seems to be it..\n\nMaybe later in the game you can control how powers appear but for now I don't see that ability..\n\nThe game play is sort of what you'd expect from \"City of Heroes' 2\" which is all Champions Online is.  Its fun, but don't expect anything super awesome like..\n\nMy major complaint with the game at this point was a graphic setting that defaulted to on, and made the game look horrible..   They had \"Depth of Field\" turned on, which meant that the farther away from the camera an object/item/scene was, the blurier it was.  It got so blurry during one scene it was hard to look at.. it actually made me a little ill..  I had to turn DOF off completely..\n\nI'm not sure I fully appreciate the cell shading thing to be honest.. I understand why they went that way, and I believe in the long run it will stand the test of time better than a more \"realistic\" theme..  I just don't really like it yet..   I have the same issue with the stylistic graphics of World of Warcraft.. its just a personal opinion thing really..\n\nAll in all I think the game is good..\n\nI very much recommend it.. and if you liked City of Heroes I think you'll really like Champions Online..\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2009-08-06-offensive-footwear.md","url":"/offensive-footwear/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-08-06-offensive-footwear.md","id":"/offensive-footwear","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Offensive footwear!","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2009/08/feets-150x150.png","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-08-06 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"offensive-footwear","ext":".md"},"url":"/game-review-champions-online/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-08-12-game-review-champions-online.md","id":"/game-review-champions-online","collection":"posts","excerpt":"Okay I know I'm not supposed to talk about this yet, but it's near enough to open beta that I feel I can safely talk about the game without giving anything important away -- or at the very least I think I'm safe from being sued..  (Please don't sue me..)","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Game Review: Champions Online","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2009/08/defender1-champ-online-415-150x150.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-08-12 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"game-review-champions-online","ext":".md"},"url":"/28-hdmi-monitor/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-08-14-28-hdmi-monitor.md","id":"/28-hdmi-monitor","collection":"posts","excerpt":"So Tigerdirect was having a hell of a deal on something I have sorta wanted for  a while...   I have been playing games, programming, and generally tooling around on a 20\" wide screen monitor for years now.","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"28\" HDMI Monitor","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2009/08/monitor-150x150.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-08-14 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"28-hdmi-monitor","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2009-08-12-game-review-champions-online.md","output":null,"content":"<img title=\"Champions Online\" src=\"/images/2009/08/defender1-champ-online-415-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Champions Online\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" />\n\nOkay I know I'm not supposed to talk about this yet, but it's near enough to open beta that I feel I can safely talk about the game without giving anything important away -- or at the very least I think I'm safe from being sued..  (Please don't sue me..)\n\nI have been in the Champions Online closed beta pretty much since day one and I can say without much hesitation that the game is not horrible.

In fact I would go as far as to say its pretty good and appears to be getting better with each patch..\n\nI certainly can say that as the beta has progressed the game has gotten Waaaaayy better and will very likely continue to do so for a good while yet..  And I can further say that it's good enough for me to actually purchase and play the game after release, but there are issues I hope get solved..\n\nFrom day 1 when I started in the beta I had extremely high hopes.   Extremely high..  Like.. Too high.. heh\n\nI wanted Champions online to be exactly what Champions is;  a \"sky is the limit\" paper and pencil role playing game where the player can create any kind of hero they want and effectively play within the realm of the GM's imagination..   If you as a player could imagine it,  then you could do it!  Booyah baby!\n\nI pretty much had the same hopes for City of Heroes previously and of course was let down for many of the same reasons which I'll get to..  (Note;  I liked City of Heroes and played it for a good long time but it never had the freedom and versatility that it had originally promised. )\n\nChampions Online suffers from this exact same issue -- our expectations are too high.  It's completely unrealistic to think that they could create a game where players could be ANYTHING..  I mean how do you even create the framework that can encompass a whole generation of players imaginations?!  Powers, Abilities, Costumes.. etc   You can't.. Period.. There's just no way..\n\nThis problem isn't really a problem, it's a matter of the player needing to lower their expectations a tad..   But they did call their game \"Champions\" online so of course that makes people hope for just such a thing..\n\nSo instead of trying they went the same route that they had used with City of Heroes, which is a good thing to be honest.\n\nWhat they did was to limit everything down to a set or subset of powers that you can choose from when building your super hero.  They do the same thing with costumes in that there are a finite number of elements you can choose from.\n\nIn City of Heroes you could spend days just playing with the character creator designing your hero.. Not powers or attributes, but just creating what your hero looks like.  Multiply that by a factor of 4 and you have the new character creator.  It's quite nice in that you can create just about anything.    I had a lot of fun tooling around in the character generator and made all manner of silly to serious characters.  The creator had some bugs of course, its still early in development, but it was still pretty neat.\n\nThe power sets right now seem somewhat limited..  I wish/want there to be way more powers..

I want a pair!\n\nI went to <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/stores/32\" target=\"_blank\">REI Austin</a> and tried on a couple pairs before settling on one..  They are great!  At first my toes rebelled at fitting into their own slot, but once I convinced them that I actually did want them in there all was well..\n\nIt's sort of feels like wearing a silk glove that had the bottom dipped in rubber.. Extremely comfy to be honest..  I hate having something between my toes so I was a tad worried that I wouldn't like them due to that but these feel completely natural..\n\nThe primary issue I have with them is the down right hostile reaction I get from folks when I wear them..\n\nAt this point I have been called a \"frog man\", \"weirdo\" and a \"fag\".   Can you believe that?  Someone actually was so offended by my footwear that they called me a fag... Really?   And that was three different people btw.. not just one..  Most people that seem them have a reaction, and not always a friendly one..  Everyone has to comment.. \"Nice footwear!\", \"What the hell are your wearing?!\".. etc..\n\nIt boggles the mind..   Flip-flops / Showershoes are all the rage and if you stop at any social gathering and look around someones wearing them..  Toes completely exposed.. That's normal and acceptable.. but my version of the same exact thing where the toes are covered is completely foreign  to the point of being offensive to some folks.\n\nThey are so \"weird\" that they jar that person's whole reality..  Even though they have toes too!  People are odd..\n\nI will say that I kind of feel like I'm actually using my toes to walk with for the first time..  These things are super grippy and when I walk in them, my toes are actually apart of the process..  Where as previously, in a closed mono-toe shoe your toes don't do much..\n\nIn these your toes are busy doing what they were always meant to do and as such, I have some sore muscles in my legs..  As Gonzo put it, it's sort of like the matrix..   \"Why do my toes hurt?  Because you've never used them before.. \" hehe  And he's right!  Nothing hurts.. let me be clear these are awesome.. but I can tell that some muscles are just now starting to be used..\n\nEither way I highly recommend them..\n","previous":{"next":{"path":"_posts/2009-08-06-offensive-footwear.md","url":"/offensive-footwear/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-08-06-offensive-footwear.md","id":"/offensive-footwear","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Offensive footwear!","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2009/08/feets-150x150.png","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-08-06 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"offensive-footwear","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2009-08-03-wowvswar.md","output":null,"content":"<img class=\"pull-right\" title=\"Wow versus War\" src=\"/images/2009/08/wowvswar.jpg\" alt=\"Wow versus War\" width=\"192\" height=\"192\" />\n\nI love the Warhammer universe.  I have been an avid player of the various table top miniature games as well as the couple RPG games in the same universe.   So when Warhammer Online came out a year ago, I was stoked!\n\nI figured it would be pure liquid awesome and finally give me a computer version of the game world I have enjoyed playing in for so long.\n\nOf course I was let down quite a bit in that the game was lacking..  but I get ahead of myself.\n\nWhen I learned that Warhammer online was licensed to Mythic Entertainment, I was less than thrilled.  Their only other game of note is Dark Age of Camelot which was a one trick pony (realm versus realm combat) that has no long term play associated with it..   And while the game is still around, it's just not fun.  There is nothing there to keep players like me playing the game.. I just don't enjoy it nor does it have the massive fan base that it could have if they had bothered to keep innovating.\n\nWoW on the other hand has gobs and gobs of things to do long term as well as lots of mindless achievements and other end game elements to keep players attention.  They are adding new content and new fun things to the game all the time and this is from a guy who really doesn't like WoW..\n\nWhen it comes to long term play, WoW is the clear winner.  I play it still today and have for a while now.   My guild has killed the end game boss (Yogg) many times at this point and is starting to work on getting to the next guy..\n\nI'm playing WAR too at this point, but it's just not that fun and my interest is waning.. As I played WAR originally (and as I am relearning more recently), I realize it is exactly the same game as DAoC just in a slightly different universe.  It suffers the same issues that DAoC did and really brings very little new to the table..\n\nWhat WAR does wrong:\n\n*  The PVE aspects of the game are absolutely horrible..  The questing is painfully linear and just about always forces you to venture into PVP areas even if you don't want to.\n* The zone's are confusing and poorly laid out which makes navigation with out the flight system near impossible.\n* The flight mechanic from zone to zone is long loading and lame -- considering that you must use it, it needs an overhaul.\n* The models are pretty bad, but the animations are down right dreadful...\n* I can go on and on but will leave it be as otherwise this list will be too long...\n\nWhat WAR does right:\n\nPQ's, SC's and PVP.\n\nThe public quest system is neat and I wouldn't be surprised if blizzard \"adopts\" such a system in the near future..  It's well thought out and works quite nicely.   This I think is likely to be the single innovation that folks will remember WAR for in several years..\n\nSo far the majority of the scenarios (SC's.. Think battlegrounds for you WoW players) are a lot of fun.  Again way more so than any of the BG's in WoW which I find to be tedious and boring.\n\nDAoC's big plus was the Realm versus Realm thing.. Mythic of course followed that same model in producing WAR and as such their PVP model is excellent.  The realm versus realm thing is a lot of fun.. for a while.. it becomes tedious and boring fairly quickly, but still the PVP is very good.\n\nThe PVP in WAR is far far far better than what is offered by WoW.   Period.  Full stop.\n\nThe reason for that is how the classes are balanced as well as the fact that blocking is turned on.   In WoW it's perfectly reasonable for a frail clothy to stand toe to toe with a fella in full plate and win.  Generally in WoW PVP any one class well played, can defeat any one other class..  What's the point?\n\nIn War, this is unreasonable and usually punished harshly.   As a bright wizard (weak clothy) I know that if a tank (guy in plate) charges me I have only a few seconds to react before death.. I better make them count!  Each class in the game has a specific function and is only really good at that function!\n\nWith blocking turned on (collision detection) the tanks can stand in front of the more frail classes and prevent them from being slaughtered..\n\nThe only place that this fails WAR is you have a lot of WoW players playing WAR who don't realize their place and as such just charge in and die, or refuse to block, or simply wont heal..etc.    I can't fault War for the players being stupid..\n\nThe problem here is that the game somewhat encourages players to play stupidly in that even if they don't work together in a SC the losing team still gets' a lot of experience for it.. but that's an aside.. again I really can't fault Mythic for morons..\n\nWhat I can do though is fault Mythic for producing a game that is so completely unrefined.  There are so many little things about War that is a complete fail..\n\nThe Macro system is bad.. The map system sucks.. The models are lame.. The animations are really bad.. The PVE content is tedious.. Some of the classes seem out of balance.. The crafting system is horrible and pointless.. etc..   It's just not that fun of a game and a lot of that is due to these little things..\n\nLet me be perfectly clear.  I don't like World of Warcraft.  I don't enjoy the universe at all, the stylistic game play, the mindless grinding, the life sucking raiding..etc..    I play it solely because my wife enjoys it..  Fine I'll play for her..  But I don't really like it.   I do however have to say that Blizzard has made a good game.   It's very refined in that stuff works.  It has it's own problems too.. (the inability to launch more dungeon instances is a big one.. )   But over all WoW is a good game.\n\nMythic with WAR however isn't all that good.  It really seems like they doggedly stuck to their one trick (realm vs realm) in the hopes that it would make a WoW Killer and not bother to innovate.  Okay fine, PQ's.. but that's ONE thing..   And of course just as DAoC's one trick failed to make the game a success, the exact same trick on WAR also failed..\n\nThe real issue I have is, it's been a year..  the game has done nothing in that time and at this point it doesn't look like its going to do anything..  If they don't care enough to fix their game, or innovate and make it better.. then I don't care enough to play it..\n\nCan't fix stupid.\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2009-06-07-ork-dip-the-10-minute-paint-job.md","url":"/ork-dip-the-10-minute-paint-job/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-06-07-ork-dip-the-10-minute-paint-job.md","id":"/ork-dip-the-10-minute-paint-job","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Ork Dip!
