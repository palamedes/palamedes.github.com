At this point the PC version of the latest game is completely unplayable by a large portion of the market, myself included and some how that seems okay to them.\n\nIt really seems the zero day patch system that just about all software manufacturers use is starting to get out of hand..  Whats that you ask?   Well it goes something like this;  Marketing and business have the game release date firmly set because that's what they have promised share holders.    This is a firm date and it can't move.   Period.\n\nProduct architects and management continue to shoe-horn in last minute features that they think would be cool or because users want them or because they fit some \"vision\", and expect that date they set above to not slip at all..    So it's up to the developers to squeeze out the product in a completely unreasonable amount of time..\n\nPrior to that magical date, there is another magical date when the product goes gold.. At gold (or dcut or whatever they call it) they cut a copy of the program and send it to test.  If it passes the most basic of verification tests they go on and send it to print where it gets put to disks and / or packaged up to be shipped to the user.\n\nTest continues to file defects and report problems to the developers and the developers are still working to fix those bugs..  But everyone knows that the software is full of bugs when it first goes gold and gets shipped to the customer..  Management and Marketing accepts this as \"how it is\", and usually fails to tell the shareholders it works this way..  So they are fully aware of how broken the product is, in order to meet that magical ship date..\n\nThey are just hoping like hell that once the game is installed it will automatically download the latest patch (the zero day patch) which will fix all the bugs that the game shipped with..\n\nBut that begs the question;  What happens when you willingly and knowingly ship a broken product hoping for that zero day patch, but that zero day patch isn't ready in time?  Or the zero day patch doesn't do anything to address the issues people are seeing?\n\nThis is whats going on with black ops..  There was a zero day patch (shocker) and it didn't do anything that I can tell, or at the very best brought it from a completely broken state to now just an unreasonably broken state for a game we paid $60 in order to play..\n\nThe real pisser is that companies know that we have zero recourse..  We have no way to get that money back..  I paid for a game, and it doesn't work.. and I have no recourse..   Imagine if you purchased a toaster from walmart and it just didn't do anything.. you could take it back, and have a reasonable expectation of getting your money back.   Not here;  And they know it..  They bank on it..\n\nBottom line is the game is broken for a large number of folks and they don't care.. One of the devs via his twitter account stated as much..  Instead talking about the 85k people playing right at that moment..\n\nAs of Nov 2009 the call of duty franchise sold more than 55 million units, and they think just because a paltry 85k can play the game it's okay?   Plus they have no idea how well those 85k are able to play.. I can play the game for a few minutes here and there, but it crashes or lags to a stop..etc.. Sure I was playing it but it wasn't playable.. Am I one of those 85k they are so proud of?\n\nSingle player gets laggy and stuttery while playing it but usually it's still somewhat playable, frustrating as hell, but playable.. where as multiplayer is so bad it's completely not worth trying to play..\n\nI was able to get the game to play once I turned all graphics to the minimum settings, lowered the screen resolution to something ridiculously low, and played it in a window..  THEN it's \"playable\" (I use the term loosely)..  My CPU is still hammered though..  My GPU is bored when I do this.. It almost acts like they aren't using GPU acceleration maybe?   I really don't know..\n\nThe game is unreasonably broken..  It's 100% CPU bound in that they  did virtually zero optimization on the code or left the debug code going  or aren't using GPU acceleration or something..  My quad core pegs all 4 cores to 100% while playing and  my machine while older is no slouch..\n\nIt often loses save games just out of the blue.. I got half way through the game, went to get something to eat.. came back to continue after having continued before only to have a \"New Campaign\" option.. My resume game options were all gone..  So great.. I got half way through to have to go half way through again?!  Fuck that..  This is the point when I started to fight with multiplayer..\n\nThe servers list is completely broken in multiplayer in that it often doesn't update.. or refuses to stop updating once it starts.. or you can't connect to a server at all.. or it doesn't even try to connect..\n\nOnce connected it stutters to a stop constantly.. Not network lag either this is an internal lockup of some sort.. My ping usually doesn't go above 50..  DirectX crashes, random crashes to desktop, jerky stuttery video.. etc..  It's just unplayable and not fun..\n\nIt's also pretty clear to  me that even though they list a minimum spec computer that can run the  game, they never actually tried that themselves as a lot of folks on the  forums who don't have the latest Intel i7 QuadCore Super Rig simply  can't play it..\n\nUltimately, I'm severely disappointed..  I really expected a hell of a lot more out of them..\n\nI can play COD:World at War on max graphics using my one graphics card to span 3 monitors and it works fine.. Yet this game wont work at all on the same PC?   It's not my machine..\n\nAnd by their responses, I guess COD is no longer the franchise for me..  I can't recommend this game at all.. It gets zero stars and isn't worth your money, your time, or your frustration..\n\n*EDIT:  Okay so on a whim I completely reinstalled windows from the ground up the same day that they released a new patch for the game..  Now the game is playable..  I can't actually say if it was due to the windows reinstall, the patch or both.. *\n\n*I have been playing a lot of multiplayer and I can say its not bad but still has a lot of issues which makes me think the original issue was the game not my machine..  I still get a lot of stuttering with the game as well as the crashes..  The server list is still completely borked, and server hangups/crashes seem constant too which tells me the game still needs more patching before it's good to go.. *\n\n*I'd still recommend waiting.. *\n","collection":"posts","url":"/game-review-call-of-duty-black-ops/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2010-11-14-40k-grot-tanks.md","collection":"posts","url":"/40k-grot-tanks/","path":"_posts/2010-11-14-40k-grot-tanks.md","id":"/40k-grot-tanks","draft":false,"categories":["Hobbies"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"40k Grot Tanks","layout":"post","tags":["3D Graphics"],"image":"/images/2010/11/GrotTankDemo06.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2010-11-14 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"40k-grot-tanks","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2010-11-13-game-review-call-of-duty-black-ops.md","excerpt":"I really do enjoy the Call of Duty franchise..  It started out as a PC shooter back in 2003 and was pretty much heralded as the game to be or beat..  They continued with expansion after expansion and broadened their horizons to other machines.","id":"/game-review-call-of-duty-black-ops","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Game Review: Call of Duty Black Ops","layout":"post","tags":["Call of Duty","Review"],"image":"/images/2010/11/Black-Ops.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2010-11-13 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"game-review-call-of-duty-black-ops","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2010-11-14-40k-grot-tanks.md","content":"<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2010/11/gtp34.jpg\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Simple Grot Tank\" src=\"/images/2010/11/gtp34-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Simple Grot Tank\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Simple Grot Tank</span></a>\n\nSo for giggles I have been doing some Modo work this weekend..   <a href=\"http://www.forgeworld.co.uk/Warhammer-40000/Orks/GROT-TANKS.html\" target=\"_blank\">Warhammer 40k Grot Tanks</a> amuse me so I thought it would be fun to make one in 3D..\n\nI spent the first part of the weekend completely wiping my system and reinstalling windows, redownloading my copy of Modo from luxology and getting everything set back up..  It takes a while, but not too bad to be honest..\n\nOnce that was done I started working on the roadwheels and the track..\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2010/11/TreadsDemo01.jpg\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"Tread Demo 1\" src=\"/images/2010/11/TreadsDemo01-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Tread Demo 1\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Tread Demo 1</span></a>\n\nFirst 4 hours -- It took me forever to figure out how to get the one tread I created to clone around a bezier curve such that all the points matched up.. But once I did I was very excited!!  I think it looks great and it should be fairly easy to animate too..\n\nThe tread itself isn't finished, but since it's just 55ish clones of one tread anything I do to the parent magically appears on all the children.. Good times..\n\nIt's WAAAY too clean for a grot tank right now but I figured I'd make the clean version of everything then dirty it up my mangling the mesh and adding dirty textures..\n\nI had to ask via the Luxology forums how to group the instances correctly such that I could move them.  Otherwise they go all wonky when you click and drag..  But once done it made sense and I was ready to move on to the rest of the tank..\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2010/11/GrotTankDemo01.jpg\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Grot Tank\" src=\"/images/2010/11/GrotTankDemo01-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Grot Tank\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Grot Tank</span></a>\n\n+4 hours -- The next thing I did was build in the basic body shape..  I made sure to build subdivision into this model from the start so it wouldn't be something I would have to go back and do later..\n\nI also spent some time adjusting my environment so that my renders weren't straight up black and white..\n\nI have had a couple folks ask me recently if I thought Modo was worth the money..  For me I have to say yes.. Even though I don't do this professionally, It's just a hobby play thing I still think it was well worth the cost.  For professionals I'd say it's a must have..   Just the amount of work that one can do in a very short time is amazing..  It takes some training and experience, but still its fast going..\n\nAt this point I'm going to continue to work on the model, getting the \"clean\" tank finished before starting to add the bits of scrap metal, plating, rust and grime..etc..\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2010/11/TreadsDemo02.jpg\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"Exhaust\" src=\"/images/2010/11/TreadsDemo02-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Exhaust\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Exhaust</span></a>\n\n+2 hours -- So I spent a couple hours tonight beginning the exhaust system on the back of the tank.. Far from done of course, but looks good.. Again I went through and made sure that the mesh was 100% subdivision compliant and it looks good..\n\nIts far from finished though as I'm not sure what to put inside the cutouts.. This is one place where the model can't help me because its just solid..   I'll come up with something.. Likely something silly.. this is after all a grot tank..\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2010/11/Exhaust01.jpg\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Exhaust 2\" src=\"/images/2010/11/Exhaust01-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Exhaust 2\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Exhaust 2</span></a>\n\n+4 hours -- I spent the next four hours on this model getting the exhaust on the back of the tank looking the way I wanted it to look.   It's pretty close to the model I have and should look darn good once textures are applied.\n\nI probably went a bit overboard on the polycount but oh well that's something I always do anyway..   There is a piece still missing, and that's the little bar/strap that goes from the band around the middle to the tank body.   My practical model only has a stick of resin with no detail connecting the two, and that just wont do.. I'll figure out something.. I have some ideas already..\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2010/11/GrotTankDemo02.jpg\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"Grot Tank\" src=\"/images/2010/11/GrotTankDemo02-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Grot Tank\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Grot Tank</span></a>\n\n+2 hours -- I went through and added a bunch more greebles, nurnies and what's-it's around the tank.. You can't really tell in this image but there are a lot more.  Plus I started working on the tank body though most of the work is on the other side.. heh..\n\nI have a lot more work to do but the main portion will be taking the perfectly looking model and distorting it to make it look beat up and made up scrap metal parts..  Should be fun..\n\nI haven't started the turret yet as I want to get a good handle on the rest of the tank first and there is a lot left to do.. The turret would just get in the way and make me want to work on it..  It's the coolest part after all.. Saving the best for last!\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2010/11/GrotTankDemo03.jpg\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Metal Plating\" src=\"/images/2010/11/GrotTankDemo03-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Metal Plating\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Metal Plating</span></a>\n\n+4 hours -- I have been adding a lot of little deformed plates to the model as per my practical..  Basically they look like extra bits that have been bolted on, but all of them are beat up as befitting a true Grot vehicle..  Eventually I'll have to give the main tank body this same treatment..  But for now adding all the extra plating is taking time..  I'm not have way done with that..\n\nOnce I get the bulk of the plating done, I'll start working on deforming the tank body itself, before adding the rivets and holes etc..  Texturing the noise and destruction on to the model will really make the tank come to life eventually.  Should be good.\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2010/11/GrotTankDemo06.jpg\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"More Detail\" src=\"/images/2010/11/GrotTankDemo06-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"More Detail\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>More Detail</span></a>\n\n+ a bunch of hours -- I have been adding more plating, and generally cleaning up the model..\n\nThe main body is just about ready to start getting its deformation stuff before I get on to working on the turret.  At this point though I think I need to research a better way to make some of these details.. Right now I'm actually modeling everything in which is a huge time sink as well as making the model be an unbelievable number of polygons..\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2010/11/sheetmetal.jpg\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Sheet Metal\" src=\"/images/2010/11/sheetmetal-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Sheet Metal\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Sheet Metal</span></a>\n\nTake for example the sheet metal image to the right.. that's a lot of polygons for what amounts to a pretty small detail on the back of the model..   I'm sure I'll get some points for actually modeling it, but it puts a lot of strain on the renderer..  Right now I'm over 5 million polys and I'm no where near done..\n\nI think this is where the experts know super secret tricks and things that you can do to get that kind of detail without having to actually place pixels.. Bump, normal and parallax maps for example..  No idea how to use/create those though..\n","collection":"posts","url":"/40k-grot-tanks/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2010-11-14-40k-grot-tanks.md","collection":"posts","url":"/40k-grot-tanks/","path":"_posts/2010-11-14-40k-grot-tanks.md","id":"/40k-grot-tanks","draft":false,"categories":["Hobbies"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"40k Grot Tanks","layout":"post","tags":["3D Graphics"],"image":"/images/2010/11/GrotTankDemo06.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2010-11-14 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"40k-grot-tanks","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2010-11-30-game-review-perpetuum-online.md","content":"<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2010/11/shots-2010-06-0007.jpg\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Perpetuum Online\" src=\"/images/2010/11/shots-2010-06-0007-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Perpetuum Online\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Perpetuum Online</span></a>\n\nA while back I was trolling the intertoobs for a new game when I stumbled across Perpetuum Online;  A Hungarian borne MMO based in the distant future on a far away planet where the avatars are Mech based as are the mobs with a large skill based PVE and PVP system..  Booya!  It sounded great!\n\nSo when it came out the other day, I was one of the first to sign up.  And I have to say I'm having a good time with it, but I'm getting ahead of myself..\n\nNow I want to give a fair description of the game, and I want to do my best to review it for its own merits, but its going to be really hard for me not to point out the similarities with Eve Online.\n\nThat is to say, its really similar in a lot of ways..

Okay it may be a few more and they probably aren't stuck in a garage, but you get the idea.. Something appeals to me about a small independent team as opposed to a huge corporate group with $$$$ as their only goal.. (that's not to say that a small group isn't also concerned about profits, but they usually are more open to game changing things..)\n\nThere are a lot of things that still need to be done and the devs are fully aware of that.  But it's a damn good start..\n\nI really like that I am coming to in fresh from the very beginning and can expand as the game expands.  I wonder what the game will be like in a year when new players show up and everyone else out classes the new player 10 fold.\n\nIn Eve that was a bit of a problem, but was solved by making small new player ships still somewhat competitive against the bigger ships so you could still play and not be completely out matched.   Since there are nothing but small ships in Perpetuum as of yet, I am hoping they took this approach too.  It would be bad if after a year new players show up and just repreatedly trounced..  There is no velocity or angle of attack defenses in Perpetuum, so a small bot can't \"speed tank\" a big one.. Not sure how they will handle that..\n\nAlso right now the economy is completely broken..

   I had all but forgotten about Tron to be honest until 2008 or so when I saw that first comic-con shakey cellphone cam footage of the new TR2N trailer at which point I had a tron-gasm..  Then I really thought about it and I was kinda pissed it took this long to come out with a sequel, but then once I realized what they were doing there was a pretty glaring obvious reason why it took that long..\n\nSo without spoiling anything yet, I will say that the new movie is probably an 8.5 out of 10.  The visual effects were excellent, the costumes were okay, the acting was good, the plot was still pretty thin though and that might be it's downfall..  All in all I thought it was good and about as much as they could have done with the film.   It was an entertaining movie, and well worth the viewing.\n\nSo now on to the spoilers.  You may want to look away if you haven't seen it yet.\n\nSo first I'm going to talk about all those things I didn't like - it's my show I can do it in my order;\n\nThe biggest thing they were showcasing and the likely reason it took 28 years to make a second film was of course; Clu.  Making Jeff Bridges young again in order to play his programmatical counterpart was no mean feat.  In fact I'm sure it took tens of thousands of hours to put that character together and get it fully realized.   But, it looked wrong to me.   I understand why they did it and I agree that it had to be done in order to tell this story but I just didn't buy it.   He looked wrong.\n\nSee the issue is that we know what people look like and how they should move.  It's one of the reasons that Jurassic Park lasts the test of time; there are no CG people.  The dinosaurs look perfect to us even to this day because we have no real concept of how those critters should move or look.  So that 18 year old technology still works.\n\nClu was a CG copy of Mr. Bridges and to me it stood out that he was CG.   This was really jarring for me.  In a couple of the scenes were Clu was emotional and moved his face muscles he looked way more realistic to me..\n\nThis honestly was my biggest gripe about the whole movie.  It's the thing they focused on the most, and I just don't think they got it.   I don't want to belittle the effort though because it's SO FRICKEN CLOSE.. I mean they are 95% there.. but something is missing and I can't quite put my finger on it other than to say, his eyes and face didn't move correctly.  They seemed really dead and motionless.\n\nSo the next thing was that after they did all that work on making Clu, they did ZERO work on Tron himself.  You learn who Clu's henchman is pretty quickly, it's almost obvious.. Yet he wears his motorcycle helmet the whole movie so they don't have to do his face like they did Clu's .. and as much as I just bitched that they failed at making Clu's I'm offended they didn't make Trons.\n\nSeriously it seems such a cop-out to me that Mr. Boxleitner didn't get the same facial treatment..  One might say it's because it would have taken focus away from the Flynn/Clu/Sam story.. but I dunno, give us some credit..\n\nThe next thing was the complete lack of a transition.  Again I felt this was a tad jarring, and I'm not sure if it's because I expected it or if they were assuming you had seen the first movie and didn't need to waste time and money on it or what..   But in the first movie there was a point after Flynn hit \"enter\" on the keyboard that they laser lit up and began to disassemble him..   He then traveled down the fuzz filled pipe into the computer..  It was a build up, a suspenseful transition from the real to the computerized..    Not so much here..  It seemed like  just a reel change here.. Blip! you're inside .. Go!  I was disappointed by that..\n\nAnd lastly, the plot.  Thiiin.. Like anorexic thin..  In fact much of the plot seemed to be loosely tied thread that they used to drag you from one exciting graphic packed scene to the next..  The funny thing is, it might be enough..  I dunno, we shall see..\n\nBut really, that's it.. those are the few things that really disappointed me.. And honestly those are minor.. The Clu visual was jarring for me, so it seemed a constant reminder / annoyance, the lack of transition between worlds and the paper thin plot but really beyond that everything else was good.\n\nI did find it amusing that apparently Encom OS12 is linux based? hehe Oh and the whole time Jeff Bridges was on the screen I expected him to say __\"Well, Yeah.  The Clu Abides..\"__ or some such.. heh  Love ya Jeff..\n\nThe visuals were AWESOME..  They way exceeded my expectations across the board visually..  It's clear that Hollywood knows how to make a visually stunning movie..   I have to tell you the recognizers looked fantastic..  The lightcycles looked awesome and the light fliers (?) looked really cool..\n\nI'm glad the transport ship and other things made a showing too..  In fact I liked how they seemed to give a nod to the original movie in just about every scene some how..   From Sams apartment building that had a huge gate in front of it with \"Dumont\" (the gate keeper) written at top, to Flynns old foot ball game on the couch.. ( I had that game as a kid !!)  to \"It's all in the wrists..\"   They kept doing that, and I liked that.. nice touch guys..\n\nI thought all the actors did a really good job..  I was a tad worried that Garrett Hedlund wasn't the right choice for the role of sam mainly because of Eragon.. ugh..  but he did a fine job..  Olivia Wilde did a good job bringing Quorra to life as a this weirdly tough but vulnerable warrior chick program..   Michael Sheen as Castor was a bit over the top for my tastes, but Beau Garret as Gem offset his character enough to make him not completely obnoxious.. etc..\n\nA lot of folks were upset that Yori of the original movie (played by Cindy Morgan) wasn't in this one.. and at first I thought she should be in it too, but now not so much..  She just didn't have a place in this movie..  I have no idea how they would have shoe-horned her in and maintained flow..\n\nOh and of course I have to give a nod to Daft Punk who did a killer job on the sounds..  Well done guys..\n\nSo there you have it..  I look forward to seeing all the extras and directors commentary..  I really do like the movie and hope it does really well because I want to see where they go with this..   This movie was very much a passing of the torch kind of movie with the ending it had, but I just hope they don't make us wait another fricken 28 years for TR3N!!\n","collection":"posts","url":"/movie-review-tron-legacy/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2010-12-17-movie-review-tron-legacy.md","collection":"posts","url":"/movie-review-tron-legacy/","path":"_posts/2010-12-17-movie-review-tron-legacy.md","id":"/movie-review-tron-legacy","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Movie Review: Tron Legacy","layout":"post","tags":["Movie","Review"],"image":"/images/2010/12/Tron-Legacy-Poster.jpg","ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x2","private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2010-12-17 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"movie-review-tron-legacy","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2011-01-15-game-review-greed-corp.md","content":"<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2011/01/Greed-Corp.jpg\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Greed Corp\" src=\"/images/2011/01/Greed-Corp-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Greed Corp\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Greed Corp</span></a>\n\nI have always liked turn based strategy games.. They used to be \"the\" game genre, but over the years as time and technology has marched forward they have largely started to decline in  favor of more real time strategy games and first person shooters.\n\nSo when <a href=\"http://www.wgames.biz/\" target=\"_blank\">W!Games</a> introduced Greed Corp a modern turn based strategy game with a very clever land collapsing mechanic to the PC late last year, I was pretty excited..  This was the first I had heard of it even though the  PS3 and XBox players had access to it since last February.  I don't follow the console games market at all so it was completely new to me.\n\nI have to admit I really like it.. The best part about this game is that it's actually a game.. Meaning it focuses on game play not wizbang special effects or graphics..  I really feel that this is a shining example of good game design and salute the W!Games folks.\n\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2011/01/Greed-Corp-screen.jpg\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"Greed Corp screen\" src=\"/images/2011/01/Greed-Corp-screen-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Greed Corp screen\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Greed Corp screen</span></a>\n\nThe fun of the game comes in the form of playing on the edge of a very delicate balancing act between harvesting resources to fuel your expansion and preserving that land to stay alive.   The games landmass is divided up into these hex tiles that you take control of in an attempt to control the whole map.  Each hex tile has a level associated with it and each time your harvester harvests it's tile and the six around it, that level is lowered one.\n\nIf you lower it too far, it breaks up and falls away.  You can (and often do) intentionally crack up some key spots to  help direct the flow or to cause a cascade of tile collapses in order to win the game..  It's a lot of fun and can be deceptively challenging..\n\nIt's not your standard 4X (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate) game like Masters of Orion or Civilization..   In that there is no exploration, you see the entire map from get go and know exactly what your opponents are doing all the time.   Nor does it have that rock/paper/scissors mechanic in it's pieces where each piece has an advantage over some other piece, but a weakness to a third as so many modern games try to do..\n\nTo me this is one of those \"chess\" games..  You have a one primary game piece that has a very specific movement rule-set.  And you have a 3 possible placeable pieces (buildings) with no movement mechanic but affect the map or gameplay in some way.  That's it.  Simple.  Elegant.\n\nThe rest of it is about playing your opponent by out maneuvering them with your few pieces..  It's brilliant..\n\nI give this game 4.5 out of 5.  The only reason it's not a 5 is because the of the camera angle and zoom level.  I can't help but feel the camera angle is too steep, and pine for the ability to zoom out a bit..  But other than that I can honestly say well done guys.. Great stuff.\n","collection":"posts","url":"/game-review-greed-corp/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2011-02-09-15-mac-book-pro.md","collection":"posts","url":"/15-mac-book-pro/","path":"_posts/2011-02-09-15-mac-book-pro.md","id":"/15-mac-book-pro","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"15\" Mac Book Pro!","layout":"post","tags":["Apple"],"image":"/images/2011/01/apple_mbp_core_i5_8.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2011-02-09 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"15-mac-book-pro","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2011-01-15-game-review-greed-corp.md","excerpt":"I have always liked turn based strategy games..
