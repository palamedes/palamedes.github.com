Sorta..\n\nI don't want to claim the label burning idea as my own, but I have to admit I had the same idea several times after many an hour of trying to get some form of \"pretty\" label into my CD's without completely throwing them out of balance..   And I am opt'ing to review the technology as a whole, not an individual burner..  They will all work about the same..\n\nSo, with that I have to say the burner itself is excellent.. I have had zero dead discs (discs that just fail for no reason during the burn process) and it is pretty darn fast at burning the disk data..  My old burner would have dead discs all the time and was slow as hell by comparison..  This is likely just due to the new 16x burner being a generation (or two?) newer than my old one..\n\nSo.. the long and short of it is, when it comes to burning your data -- it works just fine.  But that's not the real reason I purchased it.. I want a device that can burn labels so that I don't have to use stickers, a special printer or even (god forbid) a sharpie..\n\nStickers tend to throw the disc out of balance which at modern high drive speeds can be a bad thing.. Special printers can be pricey (though the new ones that print right on the disc do a nice job) and the require inks, and in some cases label stickers..  And if I have to resort to a sharpie no one will know what is on the darn disc cause my hand writing is horrible..\n\nSo this is where the technology is supposed to really shine and it does to a point but I have some complaints..\n\nFirstly, let me say it's awesome being able to photoshop up some labels and just burn them to the disc..  The Lightscribe folks have even put together a software package that allows you to cobble together labels from preexisting templates, with lots and lots of other templates downloadable off their website..\n\nThat's nice..\n\nBut (complaint #1) it's ungodly slow..  It takes something like 6 minutes to burn an ISO with this 16x burner? I don't know the exact time but it's pretty darn fast.. It then takes about 35 minutes to burn the label..  Why does it take so long?\n\nThat wouldn't be too bad if it weren't for the fact that (complaint #2) the label is extremely light or faded and hard to read.  Folks on one forum I browsed were joking that we have to wait for the \"DarkScribe\" burner to come out before the labels will be easy to read..  Frankly the contrast ratio is extremely poor..  For the amount of time it took, it should produce a much sharper image than it does.. Apparently this is something new to the 16x discs and the old 8x discs didn't do this..\n\nAlso, I haven't tested this yet but I'm told all you have to do is burn the label multiple times in order for it to be easier to read.. that means though that you have to suffer that 35 minute label burn several times.. Bleh..  Apparently around the center of each disc there is a barcode that allows the drive to know the precise rotational position of the disc, enabling multiple burns..\n\nAnd finally, (complaint #3) apparently you have to take special storage precautions with the discs or else the labels will fade..  Seriously?!\n\nI don't know how bad the fading can get as the labels seem somewhat faded right out of the burner..  I think any amount of fading would render the label unreadable in fairly short order..\n\nSo.. there you have it.. I love the technology but the fact that it's Slow as hell, Faded unless burned multiple times, and Can fade further seems like some pretty stiff drawbacks..\n\nSuddenly the printer that can print directly on the disc, in color no less, seems like a better option..   (Yeah lightscribe can't do color)..  One thing I was surprised by was the cost of the media..  Lightscribe discs used to be a lot more expensive than regular CD/DVD's.. that isn't the case any longer.. So yay for that..\n\nAll in all I'm happy with the purchase and would recommend the burner, but you have to understand that you will need to burn the label a couple times to get a good looking label with any contrast to it..\n","collection":"posts","url":"/hardware-review-lightscribe-cddvd-burners/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2009-12-09-play-the-radio-2.md","collection":"posts","url":"/play-the-radio-2/","path":"_posts/2009-12-09-play-the-radio-2.md","id":"/play-the-radio-2","draft":false,"categories":["Hobbies"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Play the radio 2","layout":"post","tags":["Music"],"image":"/images/2009/12/eviolin-150x150.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-12-09 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"play-the-radio-2","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2009-11-16-hardware-review-lightscribe-cddvd-burners.md","excerpt":"Back in 2004 Hewlett-Packard engineer Daryl Anderson had the notion that if you can burn data on to a disc, why couldn't use use that same technology to burn the label?  And thus the LightScribe burner was born..","id":"/hardware-review-lightscribe-cddvd-burners","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Hardware Review: Lightscribe CD/DVD Burners","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2009/11/592px-CDLabelLightScribe_WikipediaLogo.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-11-16 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"hardware-review-lightscribe-cddvd-burners","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2009-12-09-play-the-radio-2.md","content":"<img title=\"Electric Violin\" src=\"/images/2009/12/eviolin-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Electric Violin\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" class='pull-right' />\n\nSo I had said previously that my musical talent ended pretty much at the ability to <a href=\"/play-the-radio/\" target=\"_self\">play the radio</a>, and that I hated that..  I wrote that entry back in July of '08 and I still hate it..\n\nI have been looking around for ideas of what to play and am still undecided.. I have a nice piano so my investment there at this point would be only time, but I am not interested in it -- it still doesn't inspire me..  I still like the idea of the Chapman stick but the cost is just unreasonable and frankly the alternative is not as pretty (yes that matters) not to mention they have horrible business tactics which I don't appreciate..\n\nI thought about getting a guitar and may still do that as there's a ton of info out there for free as well as an awesome assortment of equipment.. So baring anything else.. I'll do that.. I can get a guitar on the cheap and I have 4 or 5 friends that have offered to loan me an instrument..\n\nHaving said that, of late a coworker of mine has gotten me interested in learning the violin or viola..   Plus I have done a lot of looking online and I have to admit they look fun..  The concept of an electric violin appeals to me.. hehe\n\nI think I like the sound of the viola more than that of the violin but it seems to me that everything out there is aimed more at teaching you the violin, and then you convert that knowledge to the viola or the cello..  As I understand it the knowledge transfers quit easily and I wouldn't be surprised if way back in history \"Violin\" translates to \"small Viola\".. heh\n\nWhat's really funny is I like the idea of an electric violin the most.. Primarily because I know its something that I could build..  I know.. whacky.. but I'm a damn good carpenter and frankly they don't look hard to build..  I have watched quite a few videos of them being made and to be honest, the only thing I need is the measurements..\n\nNot sure how the sound is picked up though -- it appears to be a crystal in the bridge which makes sense, since unlike an electric guitar there are no metal strings.. Beyond that making sure strings are correctly isolated and that the measurements are sound it seems easy..\n\nI'm not going to rush out of build one of course.. I mean if you can't play it what's the point..\n\nI have purchased several books and am reading up on the violin though as I think it's something I'd like to start doing.. I have wasted enough of my life sans music, it's time to start picking something up..  I found a place here in town that rents very nice violins for as low as $20-$30 a month and they have a looong list of instructors..\n\nI have told the wife of the plans and she seemed opened to it..  Good thing too as I'm sure for a while its going to sound like I'm torturing a cat to death..  I also have looked into various forms of \"muffles\" for violins so that I don't drive her completely insane..\n\nMore reading and video watching though to try to make sure it's what I want to do..\n\nOn a side note;  I have watched a lot of YouTube video's recently of people playing all manner of instruments and I'm just stunned and amazed at the varitey of talent there is out in the world..\n\nSome of you are fantastic!  Some.. not so much.. heh..  Gotta take the good with the bad I suppose..\n\nBut it just amazes me the number of people who record themselves performing their art for others to watch and even critique.. (though to be honest you're better off just closing the \"text comments\" and never ever reading them again.. It's also stunning how completely rude people are considering folks are opening themselves up to constructive comments, not unhelpful bad-mouthing by someone who couldn't even perform to the level they are bashing.)\n\nKelly Iverson (\"The Lady\") and Mark Allen (\"Doc Parsons\") are a fantastic example of people who love what they do and do it for our enjoyment.. they also show nicely that a well played guitar sounds wonderful with a well played violin.. Thanks guys, well done..\n*links removed*\n\nSome of the instruments are .. uh.. odd.. to say the least.. For example, the following is a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyckelharpa\" target=\"_blank\">nyckelharpa</a> and a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurdy_gurdy\" target=\"_blank\">hurdy gurdy</a> duo -- Stick around for the whole thing:\n*links removed*\n\nWasn't that great?!  I mean two instruments that absolutely fill the space with sound.. I'm not sure another instrument would fit in there.. heh\n\nI had never heard of a Nyckelharpa before but apparently it's a traditional Swedish instrument from the 14th century.. Very cool.. There are a lot of youtube videos of people playing them and they are neat..  The hurdy gurdy is I have heard before in person and you really can't appreciate it until you feel the buzz.. It's a wildly expressive instrument.. It's very cool that people not only still play these but are darn good at it..\n\nThere are a lot more examples too of folks willing to put themselves out there.. Kudos to you all.. Aint the internet cool.. =)\n","collection":"posts","url":"/play-the-radio-2/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2009-12-09-play-the-radio-2.md","collection":"posts","url":"/play-the-radio-2/","path":"_posts/2009-12-09-play-the-radio-2.md","id":"/play-the-radio-2","draft":false,"categories":["Hobbies"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Play the radio 2","layout":"post","tags":["Music"],"image":"/images/2009/12/eviolin-150x150.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-12-09 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"play-the-radio-2","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2010-01-04-star-trek-online.md","content":"<img class=\"pull-right\" src=\"/images/2010/01/sto.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"210\" height=\"110\" />\n\nI have to admit that one of the games I am looking forward to in 2010 is Cryptic's, Star Trek Online.\n\nSome might wonder why the single most popular science fiction franchise in the history of media has taken so long to be turned into an MMO, myself included -- But I think it's a better use of our efforts to instead not speculate too much on the why of it but rather to channel that raw emotion and energy into the heart felt desire for STO to not suck.\n\nLet's be honest here, Cryptic Studios is very good at bringing out games that look kinda keen, but have zero long term playability.   City of Heroes and City of Villains suffered from this, and the successor Champions Online (City of Champions?) was even worse.   They looked great, but for whatever reason they just didn't have the sticking power to keep players interested.\n\nWill STO be the same thing?  Look good initially and maybe be fun for a week or two, but rapidly drag down into a grind-tastic mess?  God I hope not..\n\nI can't actually put my finger on what it is about CoH/CoV and CO that make them lose their fun.  I will say that of the three, I think City of Villains was the best with regards to game play but that was primarily due to the controller character architecture.  What can I say; I enjoyed having a pack of zombies at my disposal..\n\nGame play wise though, all of them got very boring and repeatative very very quickly.\n\nOne of the main cool points about the game was the ability to make all your characters 100% unique, but at the same time I can't help but wonder if that was part of it's downfall too..  When you look at games that have a more ridgid class structure you end up having a sort of community around that class, and with that community you have competition.  \"Oh yeah?

You wont be saving money, instead you'll be giving your money to these unscrupulous companies who are doing their best through fear to drive the price as high as it can go before it crashes.  And it will crash.  Let me explain why;\n\nSee.. Gold is a commodity and a standard.  As such, it's value never really changes.  What changes is the dollars value in relation to the gold.. So when you see golds value go up, what you're actually seeing is the dollar go down.  When you have say 10 ounces of gold worth $3000, and suddenly that prices shoots to $10000 what you're actually seeing is the value of the dollar shoot down.  10 ounces of gold is still just 10 ounces of gold.\n\nWhen the dollar strengthens again (as it always does) you'll see the price of gold go back down to something more reasonable.  This is why I say gold WILL crash..  that means that the folks who purchased gold at $1120 an ounce will take it on the chin..\n\nI'm not saying that you should never buy gold.. Actually I think gold can be a good thing to buy, but only when the dollar is very strong (and thus the price of gold is lower).\n","collection":"posts","url":"/buy-gold-just-not-right-now/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2010-01-05-buy-gold-just-not-right-now.md","collection":"posts","url":"/buy-gold-just-not-right-now/","path":"_posts/2010-01-05-buy-gold-just-not-right-now.md","id":"/buy-gold-just-not-right-now","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Buy gold!!!

Let people pick it up!   Most likely you've gotten all the early adopters you're going to get, now is the time to shuffle it out to the stores so the masses can get a hold of it.\n\nI think if the hold outs just got the device in their hands they'd see that the device itself is rock solid.  I love how everything just works.  Little things that were an issue with the iphone (granted it's a gen one iphone) this phone doesn't have.   Everything just works.\n\nStreaming Music from a site of my choosing ( <a href=\"http://di.fm/\" target=\"_blank\">http://di.fm</a> highly recommended ) ?  Yeah that works..  Streaming music that requires an authentication?  Yeah that works..  Straight to your A2DP stereo bluetooth headset?  yeah that works..  Put the phone down and leave it for 2 hours while you're doing something else.. come back and just poke play on your headset to resume?  Yeah.. that works too..   Been listening to some vocal trance the whole time I wrote this, and I've been wandering around the house a bit too..\n\nNone of that worked on my iphone.   And the bluetooth antenna rocks btw.. my iphone to headset pairing was weak and kinda crappy.. Not here -- the pairing is good and I have yet to have static or noise creep in unlike on the iphone.\n\nJust more examples of how good the hardware is.  I think google really was trying to build the cadillac of phones.    When ordering, I was concerned about the make of the product -- I was worried it would be flimsy or weak in some ways but its not at all.  The hardware feels solid though it does suffer the same \"greasy screen\" issues that all modern phones suffer.  I will say this for the iphone, it felt solid.  This phone feels the same way.  It's a teeny-tiny bit larger than the iphone so it doesn't fit in the belt case I like.. damn it.. heh but the weight is about the same.\n\nThe new OLED screen is amazing.  Sitting next to my iPhone at with the N1 at half brightness, its much brighter than the iphone.  In fact it makes the iphones screen look dull by comparison.\n\nI think android 2.1 works great, I have yet to run into any problems..  I have read that some people have found bugs but I haven't seen any..  Maybe I don't know what to look for.. I dunno.\n\nThe call quality is good and more importantly the audio levels are high enough I can hear in a noisy room.  One of my main complaints with my iphone was that if there was ANY ambient noise I simply couldn't hear someone on the phone, and the speaker phone was a joke.  The speaker phone on the Nexus still isn't as loud as I would like, but its far better than the iphone.    My Nokia Communicator had a GREAT speakerphone.. clearly phone makers need to contact the nokia folks and find out how its done..\n\nLike I keep saying.. it just works.. yay!\n\nIssues as I see them so far;\n\nGoogles grand plan is to change the face of the cell phone industry by offering a device that can doesn't limit you to a carrier.  Amen Brother.   But then they tether it to T-Mobile?  I can't help but think that this was a mistake.   In my opinion the number 1 killer of the iPhone was AT&amp;T.  Here in the Austin area the network is so saturated that it doesn't work.  AT&amp;T simply wasn't ready to handle the influx of customers that the iPhone generated.  T-Mobile (formerly VoiceStream) will suffer the same problem if the Nexus is even remotely as popular as the iphone was when it hit the market.\n\nI know they are releasing other versions of the phone to other carriers, but how does that change what we have today?  You're still locked to a network.   More over, even if you purchased the unlocked version of the phone you're still tied to one network due to 3G frequencies ..etc..  For example;  Right now this phone won't work with AT&amp;T's 3G network. Period.\n\nWe shall see..\n\nIt's still a new offering and I was a day one adopter so I don't know if this is a fair criticism on my part, but there are ZERO accessories for this sucker.  I know give it a month.. but still.  I want a stand.. some carrying case options.. some screen protection options..etc..\n\nWhat the hell is the point of the track ball?   I'm worried about the track ball popping out or in some way breaking.. It's the only part of the phone that concerns me because it kinda sticks out.    And it really seems to serve no purpose..   Again it's something that folks can use so we will likely see games that use it soon.\n\nI just had another complaint pop into and out of my head before I could write it down and now I can't remember what it was.. damn it..\n\nIt's not perfect.. but it's a wonderful device.\n\nI hate the question \"Is it the iphone killer\".. that's just a retarded question.. It's a damn good device, hows that?  I think for googles first try, its awesome and worth every penny.\n","collection":"posts","url":"/hardware-review-nexus-one/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2010-01-18-game-review-star-trek-online.md","collection":"posts","url":"/game-review-star-trek-online/","path":"_posts/2010-01-18-game-review-star-trek-online.md","id":"/game-review-star-trek-online","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"PVP and Star Trek Online","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2010/01/sto.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2010-01-18 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"game-review-star-trek-online","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2010-01-10-hardware-review-nexus-one.md","excerpt":"I was tired of my original iPhone and that would be getting the Sony Ericsson Xperia X10 when it came out some time later this year.   That was before I heard/read about Google's offering; the Nexus One.","id":"/hardware-review-nexus-one","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Hardware Review: Nexus One","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2010/01/nexusone.png","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2010-01-10 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"hardware-review-nexus-one","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2010-01-05-buy-gold-just-not-right-now.md","excerpt":"So there are a lot of people, some famous, trying to get you to buy gold..  While I was in the car dealership the other day in the waiting area they had the TV playing and there was something like 10 different gold resellers trying to convince us that NOW is the time to buy gold..","id":"/buy-gold-just-not-right-now","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Buy gold!!!
