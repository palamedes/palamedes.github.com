LEGEN-DARY!  (er.. sorry.. wrong show)..  Joss Whedon put together this little internet mini-series during the writers strike and its really very good.\n\nIt stars Neil Patrick Harris (commonly known as Doogie Howser) as Dr. Horrible, Nathan Fillion (Malcom Reynolds or the wrong private Ryan) as Captain Hammer (\"Corporate Tool\" hehe), and Felicia Day (Buffy, and The Guild) as Penny, Dr. Horribles love interest.  It's spread out over 3 episodes spanning a grand total of about 40 minutes..\n\nIn an attempt to test the waters, joss and crew have decided to release this pony for free over the course of the next couple of days, then to offer it for sale.  One week only!!  Posted initially on the 15th, they stay free until the 20th then go for sale..  I love this idea.. One week, get the word out.. then see who comes and buys it.  I would.. its good!\n\nIn fact, I'm stunned at how good it is.. hehe I shouldn't be, I mean Joss is great -- just watch firefly, serenity, buffy..etc.. (Damn you fox!)  But this is a good little show..  I wish it were longer.. (Sorta like Firefly.. But I digress..)\n\nI love musicals.. I dunno why.. I know its not manly, I don't care.  I really enjoy them and when they are comical, they are even better.   This was a fantastic show with just the right amount of music.. More over they were all really well done!\n\nAnd while I do like Nathan Fillion, I think Neil Patrick Harris completely stole the show.  He was great!  He makes me want to be in the Evil League of Evil!  I had no idea he could sing! It was fun seeing Simon Helberg show up as \"Moist\"..heh  I'm enjoying him on Big Bang Theory.. (did he do your piano work?)\n\nNathan's \"Moral dilemma\" song (end of act 2) was fantastic and probably my favorite.  The end of act 1 song was good too..  Oh and Joss, Loved the chair.. heh  I also really loved the whole bad horse stuff.. that was funny as hell..\n\nThis whole thing was done on a shoe string budget but you wouldn't know to look at it.  I mean the camera work looked great, the lighting and sound were fine.  More over they got excellent talent and whoever wrote the songs was great!  Lots of counterpoint which was fun.\n\nVery well done though guys.. kudos!  I wish it was longer than 3 episodes -- BALLS!\n\nOn a side note, I'd love to see numbers as to how much this actually cost.  Down to equipment, stars, etc.. maybe show us the original script etc..  Really use this as a lesson to the \"fan films\" and Amateur films community to show us really how its done.  That sort of thing would be of interest to everyone and I think they'd pay to see the 'behind the scenes' stuff..  I know I would.\n","collection":"posts","url":"/dr-horribles-sing-along-blog/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2008-07-26-warhammer-and-warhammer-online.md","collection":"posts","url":"/warhammer-and-warhammer-online/","path":"_posts/2008-07-26-warhammer-and-warhammer-online.md","id":"/warhammer-and-warhammer-online","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Warhammer and Warhammer Online","layout":"post","tags":["Warhammer"],"image":"/images/2008/07/runtherd.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-07-26 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"warhammer-and-warhammer-online","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2008-07-17-dr-horribles-sing-along-blog.md","excerpt":"Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog is LEGEN-DARY!

I also used to play the Warhammer fantasy role playing game when I was in highschool..  Right now I'm doing my damnedest to assemble and paint models for my new Warhammer 40k Orks Army.\n\nI love those little green bastards but I have a billion of them to paint.. (Okay, a billion might be a bit of an exaggeration, but not by much.)   Over the years I have had Necron, Tau and Orks as my 40K armies, and Orcs &amp; Goblins, Skaven and Tomb Kings as my Fantasy armies.   I played the role playing game for years and really preferred it to D&amp;D or any of the other traditional role playing systems..\n\nI tell you this so that you will come away with the understanding that I have a pretty good idea about the Warhammer universe and to convey to you how absolutely excited I was about <a href=\"http://www.warhammeronline.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Warhammer Online, Age of Reckoning</a>.   I had long thought this universe was ripe for computer games.\n\nI was proven right when Blizzard pretty much raped the Warhammer universe for all of it's games -- but that's for another post..\n\nNeedless to say, after doing a lot of looking, I'm a little disappointed in the direction the Warhammer Online game is taking.  Firstly, it looks terrible.  The graphics look extremely \"<a href=\"http://mythicmktg.fileburst.com/war/us/home/flash/2008_03_VotM.html\" target=\"_blank\">Last Generation</a>\" in my mind.  My first thought was, wow.. it looks like Dark Age of Camelot.   I then learned it was being put out by the original DAOC creators.. that gave me a chuckle, and worried me.   If their mark was to make a game that from launch looks 4 or 5 years old, then kudos boys, ya did it.   If you're intent was to make a modern looking game then you failed.\n\nIt has a wonderful <a href=\"http://mythicmktg.fileburst.com/war/us/home/flash/flash-cinematic.html\" target=\"_blank\">Cinematic Trailer</a> but that doesn't tell you anything about the game play -- and that trailer is over 2 years old at this point..\n\nIt really looks like they are trying to duplicate Blizzards World of Warcraft art style, all the while blizzard is basically using clones of their intellectual property..  It's just sad.   Especially considering one of the Q and A presenters when asked how they would deal with competition like World of Warcraft responded, \"Kill them!\"   But.. you're imitating them.. OH.. I see.. kill them, then you can say what you're doing is original.. Got it.\n\nMore over in the modern era of dual and quad core machines they are intentionally keeping the system spec's dreadfully low.  They haven't released the system requirements yet, but I bet you I could play it on my phone..  It doesn't look any more advanced than Everquest 1 was..   To be honest, World of Warcraft actually looks a little better..  (I shun myself for saying that.. )  The Beta footage of Warhammer Online looks extremely lack-luster.    They are talking about not wanting to make users need \"liquid cooled super computers\", but from the looks of it don't come anywhere near close to that.  They may be very high poly count models, but they use the blizzard art style and thus they all look flat with sharp corners in an almost cartoon style.\n\nDuring the Q and A session one of the devs was bragging about how he plays it on his old laptop and has zero problems..  *sigh*   I can't help but feel the game industry is going the wrong way here..  This is yet another case of \"Blizzard did it so, it must be right!\"   I'm not saying go extreme high graphics like Crysis or Vanguard, just more than WoW cartoon blockiness.\n\nThey claim to be looking to the future, but it doesn't appear that's the case with regards to the LOOK of the game.  Now I will be the first to stand up and say that game play ALWAYS comes first.. But why start with it looking old and outdated?\n\nI do appreciate that they are looking to the future with content though.. they have 2 years of content planned to include the first 2 major patches, as well as being in planning and pre-production of the first expansion.. that's nice..  That usually means they have budgeted it and that the game wont be here today, gone tomorrow.   But, When do we get a graphics update?  (Even World of Warcraft desperately needs one at this point and is my major sticking point with Wow.  I hate the look.)\n\nThey are all proud about how their game doesn't start until you have gotten to the end of your leveling.  Meaning, you play the game from 1 to 50 and at 50 the game \"really starts\".  They tout that as being original and exciting when that's EXACTLY what World of Warcraft does, the WoW game doesn't start until you get to 70..  Period.   All the grind to get there has nothing to do with WoW..  Its actually true of most games..\n\nThey are excited about all their \"unique\" advancement systems, but none of them sound unique.  WoW gives you all the armor stuff, EQ1/EQ2/WoW gives you the alternate advancements and traits..  D&amp;D Online gives you stat advancements.. City of Heroes gives you the badges, awards and trophies.. etc..   It's been done.  Move on.\n\nAnd what the hell, if you want to customize the look of your character above the standard 2 or 3 sliders you have to buy the special copy of the game?!  Fuck you!  That's just asinine and is the first HUGE red flag for me.  Talk about nickel and diming the hell out of people..   I can't think of anything that will make me not want to play the game more than being forced to play the same looking toon someone else plays  simply because I didn't want to fork over the extra $40 to get the \"special\" edition of the game.  I want to be able to customize and I should be able to using the standard edition of the game.\n\nIt really seems the ONLY thing that Warhammer online has going for it is the realm versus realm, and player versus player game play.  To be honest, I could give a crap about that.  I didn't enjoy it in DAOC, and I don't know that I'll enjoy it here.  From what I can see, it doesn't look like they have any end game PVE?! Are you kidding me?  Of all the shit to NOT copy from WoW or EQ, you miss this one?\n\nIn the end, if I wanted to play world of warcraft, I'd play world of warcraft -- if I wanted to play DAOC, I'd play DAOC.  I have yet to see anything that makes this game stand apart from blizzards blatant IP theft of the Warhammer Universe or DAOC.\n\nThis game seems like nothing but DAOC 2 using the Warhammer IP.  And that's sad, it could have been so much more.  Games Workshop, you should hang your head.\n","collection":"posts","url":"/warhammer-and-warhammer-online/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2008-07-26-warhammer-and-warhammer-online.md","collection":"posts","url":"/warhammer-and-warhammer-online/","path":"_posts/2008-07-26-warhammer-and-warhammer-online.md","id":"/warhammer-and-warhammer-online","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Warhammer and Warhammer Online","layout":"post","tags":["Warhammer"],"image":"/images/2008/07/runtherd.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-07-26 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"warhammer-and-warhammer-online","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2008-07-28-cryptic-studios.md","content":"Shooting themselves in the foot?

The copilot of the previous leg ( and pilot of the next leg ) of our trip let me sit in the pilots seat of the four year old 737 700.\n\nI sat there for thirty minutes talking to him about everything under the sun. Nice guy. He's an old computer nerd like me and my friends and we had a good chat. He showed me a lot of the controls for the plane and introduced me to the various screens as shown in the picture. My side is an exact mirror of what you see there. (with the exception of having a fairly competent pilot on that side. )\n\nDid you know that the 737 has pull down HUD? It was very cool. Wish I had thought to snap a couple more pics but I didn't think to take that one until just before I got up. It's odd but I felt so much better about the flight once I talked to him and found out he could have been one of us.\n\nMy friends are all now terrified of flying.. haha\n\n__Original Post__: I used to think I hated traveling in general, but the more I ponder it the more I realize that I like to travel. ... I just don't like to fly commercial.\n\nA hundred and fifty people jammed six abreast in a tiny metal tube thirty thousand feet in the air -- Not my idea of fun.\n\nSo of course, I find myself in exactly that situation.  IBM had an emergency offsite that they needed a UI developer to attend to and I was the likely (only?) choice.\n\nAnyone who knows me knows I don't like people as it is.  But put me in this situation where personal space and comfort are completely null and void and it begins to wear on my cherub like demeanor.\n\nPeople don't mean to be rude nor do they indend to bump and poke into me but some times I wonder if the stop trying on the plane.  It's almost as if folks say to themselves, \"fuck it, the isles are to small anyway so I'm gonna whack everyone as I walk past. \"\n\nSpeaking of that -- you gotta have a narrow ass to sit in these seats.

Sometimes, the second clause doesn't really look like a complete sentence, so you must watch closely.\n\n*Example:  Twelve workers started the project; only five remain.*\n\nThere is, however, one exception that can cause you a problem. You don't use a semicolon to connect two complete sentences if there's a conjunction between the clauses (and, but, etc.). In that case, use a comma.\n\n*Example:  This could be a complete sentence, and this could be another one.*\n\nAdding that single word, the conjunction \"and,\" means that you must change that semicolon into a comma.\n\n__To Serve as a Super-comma__\n\nWhen you have a series of three or more items that normally would be separated by commas except that each individual item already has a comma in it, you use the semicolon between items.\n\n*Example:  We visited Pago Pago, Western Samoa; Curitiba, Brazil; and St. George, Utah.*\n\n*Example:  The trio's birthdays are November 10, 1946; December 7, 1947; and October 31, 1950.*\n\n*Example:  Her favorite players are Steve Young, a quarterback; Jason Buck, a defensive end; and Ty Detmer, another quarterback.*\n\nAs in the examples above, citing places, dates, and people's names with descriptions, are three very common situations where you'll see the super-comma usage.\n\n__Minor Uses__\n\nA few relatively infrequent situations also call for a semicolon. When you list three or more items tacked onto the end of a complete sentence preceded by a connector word such as \"that is,\" \"for example,\" or \"for instance,\" you may use either a comma or a semicolon. Either of the following two example sentences is correct.\n\n*Example:  Be sure to watch out for grammar errors; for instance, comma splices, run-on sentences, and dangling modifiers.*\n\n*Example:  Be sure to watch out for grammar errors, for instance, comma splices, run-on sentences, and dangling modifiers.*\n\nYou may also use a semicolon to connect two otherwise complete sentences even if they are connected by a conjunction, if the first sentence already has one or more commas in it. It's optional, but may on occasion make the sentence more understandable.\n\n*Example:  When I eat alone, I leave a mess; but that's not the worst of it.*\n\nBoth the minor uses noted above are optional, so if you can remember only the first two situations above, you'll never go wrong by putting a semicolon where it doesn't belong.\n","collection":"posts","url":"/knowledge-when-to-use-semicolon/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2008-09-02-game-review-grid.md","collection":"posts","url":"/game-review-grid/","path":"_posts/2008-09-02-game-review-grid.md","id":"/game-review-grid","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Game Review: GRID","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2008/09/gridbox.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-09-02 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"game-review-grid","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2008-08-12-knowledge-when-to-use-semicolon.md","excerpt":"The semicolon is a simple piece of punctuation, much easier to work with than the comma because it follows fairly clear rules.  If you learn the two simple rules explained here, you'll rarely go wrong.  It has two main uses, which are both easy to identify.","id":"/knowledge-when-to-use-semicolon","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Knowledge: When to use semicolon.","layout":"post","tags":["Educational"],"image":"/images/2009/08/124211417018024.jpg","ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x2","private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-08-12 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"knowledge-when-to-use-semicolon","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2008-08-12-i-hate-airplanes.md","excerpt":"I used to think I hated traveling in general, but the more I ponder it the more I realize that I like to travel. ...
