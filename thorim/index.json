Or more importantly, texture only one and you texture them all.. Yay!\n\nThis mesh promises to be WAY cleaner than the Hammerhead mesh which at this point I'm embarrassed by..\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2009/05/leman-russ-02.jpg\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Leman Russ 02\" src=\"/images/2009/05/leman-russ-02-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Leman Russ 02\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Leman Russ 02</span></a>\n\n+2 hours -- Okay I have added more features and details to the side of the hull.. The two side doors are open to the world now, as well as adding various other bits and greebles.  I'll add doors later, as well as adding the sponson which can be used or not depending on the vehicle I actually want..  (Lots of different vehicles in the 40k universe use the same basic body.)  I have also started working on the track which I have to figure out how to correctly shape itself around the hull.  I know Modo has an ability to do this, but not sure what it is..  I may have to poke around on the forums to figure this one out..  (Note: the track is currently WAY undersized, I realizes this and it will be fixed)  All in all it's going wonderfully.. I'm enjoying this quite a bit!\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2009/05/leman-russ-03.jpg\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"Leman Russ 03\" src=\"/images/2009/05/leman-russ-03-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Leman Russ 03\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Leman Russ 03</span></a>\n\n+6 hours -- or maybe even a bit more..  So for this addition you'll note that there hasn't been a huge addition.. but it took a long time..  That's due to the tank track.. Holy crap I want to club a baby seal..  It took me ages to get the tracks in place and working.\n\nI ended up having to do the entire thing by hand since the path instancing tool in modo just doesn't work as advertised.  I followed all the tutorials I could find and none of them work.  It's a really simple process too, but the results were completely wrong each time, OR the application would just crash..   It really irritated me to no end..\n\nBut at this point the tracks are in place and ready to go, as well as having the room to put in the roadwheels and what not behind the scenes, which I will do next.   Once I get those in place I can start adding the main body..  That or working on a sponson.. not sure which yet\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2009/05/leman-russ-04.jpg\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Leman Russ 04\" src=\"/images/2009/05/leman-russ-04-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Leman Russ 04\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Leman Russ 04</span></a>\n\n+3 hours -- I finally completed the back/inner side of the tread housing.. The sides of the tank are pretty much complete at this time, sans the sponsons and texturing.. *gleee*   The more I look at the track the more I think they are a bit too thin.. I'll have to beef them up a tad, but in order to do that I have to redo them all the way around the housing.. Ugh.. I'll get to it..\n\nI have instanced and mirrored the main side in order to see an opposite.. I'm trying to figure out about how far apart they should be for the tank innards to fit..   This render also signals a slightly different render style from the others.. I'm adding in the ambient occlusion data for the render in order to give the image a more gritty film look..  Fun fun!\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2009/05/leman-russ-05.jpg\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"Leman Russ 05\" src=\"/images/2009/05/leman-russ-05-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Leman Russ 05\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Leman Russ 05</span></a>\n\n+2 hours -- Roughing out the hull!  Well I have the basics of the hull roughed out..  Now for the painful process of multiplying every single edge around the entire thing to soften them a tad.  I typically would edge bevel everything but that's just about the worst way to actually do it apparently..\n\nOnce I get the hull to subdivide the way I want/need it to such that it maintains the shape while providing clean lines I'll start working on the hull mounted cannon.   I haven't forgotten the sponsons or the track fix.. I'll get to it.\n\nAt this point I'm not sure the best way to go about subpatching the hull.. I have tried a couple things and the results were never very good..  I'm going to post on the Luxology forums and see if they have any advice.. most the folks over there are stupidly gifted when it comes to this stuff.. someone is bound to have an idea..\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2009/05/leman-russ-06.jpg\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Leman Russ 06\" src=\"/images/2009/05/leman-russ-06-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Leman Russ 06\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Leman Russ 06</span></a>\n\n+5 hours -- I spent today touching up a lot of things with the russ.. The tracks are looking a lot better now.  I thickened them up quite a bit, though you really can't tell that via the render.. they are actually twice as thick as they were before..\n\nI haven't quite decided what I want to do about the hull with regards to rounding and what not.. My traditional method is to edge bevel instead of subpatch.. but subpatching looks way way better..  So I dunno..  I'll probably just bevel this one too.. Either way, while thinking about that I went ahead and created the sponson and the bolter.. It's just about 100% accurate, but looks kinda plain.. There aren't a lot of details on there.. I might have to spice it up a tad..\n\nI did create the 40k Imperial Aquila though.. I figured if I'm gonna have it on there its not going to just be a texture.. It's gonna be modeled onto the tank.  I'll have to put it in a bunch of places so I figured I might as well do a good job of it..   Came out quite nicely I think..\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2009/05/40k-imperial-aquila-01.jpg\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"40k Imperial Aquila 01\" src=\"/images/2009/05/40k-imperial-aquila-01-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"40k Imperial Aquila 01\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>40k Imperial Aquila 01</span></a>\n\n+2 hours -- I have completely redone the 40k Imperial Aquila.  The version that is in the 06 picture is good, and actually better looking than the one on the model, but my buddy who knows about these things explained how it was still wrong.  So with that I completely redid it using an even more accurate picture to make the model.\n\nI went WAY over board heh.. Each Aquila has over 3k polygons..  That's more than the entire sponson.. Bolter and all..\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2009/05/leman-russ-sds-example-01.jpg\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Leman Russ SDS Example 01\" src=\"/images/2009/05/leman-russ-sds-example-01-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Leman Russ SDS Example 01\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Leman Russ SDS Example 01</span></a>\n\n+6 hours -- Thanks to the information provided by folks like <a href=\"http://www.luxology.com/community/profile_pop.aspx?name=Michael+Blackbourn\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Blackboum</a> and <a href=\"http://www.luxology.com/community/profile_pop.aspx?name=Richard+Hurrey\" target=\"_blank\">Richard Hurrey</a> I am going through and adding the edges necessary to correctly subpatch the body of the Leman Russ..\n\nIt's a lot of work.. basically for each edge becomes roughly 7 edges.. (hard to explain that without pictures.. but just believe me.. )  So its a lot of polygon slicing..  The main point of which will be to give the hull a \"real\" look.   I could have just beveled all of the hard edges but that starts to a ) fail at certain intersections and b ) look less real as you zoom in.\n\nConsider is this;  Imagine if you will two polygons intersecting at a 90 degree angle.  In reality nothing short of a razor blade has an edge like the one those two polygons have now created..  it just doesn't look real.  By adding a bevel you can make it look more real, but as you zoom into that bevel the polygons become apparent..    But by subdividing as you zoom in the renderer automagically generates more and more polygons.. so it always looks smooth..  That's a win for me.\n\nSimply put, it looks more \"real\"..  This has been a trail let me tell you, but now that I understand the concept I'll be doing all my models this way I think.. The results just look a lot better..\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2009/05/leman-russ-07.jpg\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"Leman Russ 07\" src=\"/images/2009/05/leman-russ-07-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Leman Russ 07\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Leman Russ 07</span></a>\n\n+3 hours -- Okay I have finished completely subdividing the hull of the tank and then went on to build the front little window hatch also using subdivison and subpatches.. It will take some getting used to but I can really see the power of doing things this way..\n\nNow that I am not fixing parts of the model I had already created, I can now go on to actually continue creating stuff..  Next I plan to make the front turret..  Fun stuff!\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2009/05/leman-russ-08.jpg\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Leman Russ 08\" src=\"/images/2009/05/leman-russ-08-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Leman Russ 08\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Leman Russ 08</span></a>\n\n+4 hours -- I have added the nose cannon as well as making some modifications to the sponsons bolter..  The new gun is completely subdivided and looks pretty good.  It looks like its too big to me but all my measurements assure me it's the right size..   Maybe it wont look so out of place once I get the top turret in place.\n\nThere is a lot of stuff going on in the back of the tank that I have yet to even start on.. I'll probably start tackling that next.\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2009/06/leman-russ-09.jpg\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"Leman Russ 09\" src=\"/images/2009/06/leman-russ-09-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Leman Russ 09\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Leman Russ 09</span></a>\n\n+2 hours -- I have been putzing around with several things for this update..   Firstly you'll note a color change in my render.. heh I was goofing off with the light and environment settings to see what I could come up with..   I'll probably keep playing with that so .. expect some differences..\n\nFurther, I roughed out the top turret housing and started working on that.. It doesn't look to scale to me.. it looks small, but all my measurements say its correct..  *shrug*   I have also started adding detail to the rear of the vehicle.. Lots of work to do there..  I'm gonna begin on hatches and things first..\n\nI have also been designing and pondering a couple animations with this and other 40k elements.. One of them deals with a drop pod which I need to model..\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2009-05-11-wacom-bamboo-graphics-tablet.md","url":"/wacom-bamboo-graphics-tablet/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-05-11-wacom-bamboo-graphics-tablet.md","id":"/wacom-bamboo-graphics-tablet","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Hobbies"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Wacom Bamboo Graphics Tablet","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2009/05/bamboo_wacom_2.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-05-11 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"wacom-bamboo-graphics-tablet","ext":".md"},"url":"/40k-leman-russ/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-05-19-40k-leman-russ.md","id":"/40k-leman-russ","collection":"posts","excerpt":"While my Tau Hammerhead is coming along nicely, I needed a bit of a break from it.  I decided to model something from either the Imperial Guard or Space Marines codex.","draft":false,"categories":["Hobbies"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"40k Leman Russ","layout":"post","tags":["Warhammer"],"image":"/images/2009/05/leman-russ-08.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-05-19 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"40k-leman-russ","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2009-05-11-wacom-bamboo-graphics-tablet.md","output":null,"content":"<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2009/05/bamboo_wacom_2.jpg\" class='fancybox pull-right'><img title=\"bamboo_wacom_2\" src=\"/images/2009/05/bamboo_wacom_2-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Wacom Bamboo\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Wacom Bamboo</span></a>\n\nI have been getting back into 3D modeling lately and ran into my old nemesis -- texturing!  For whatever reason, I had never really been very good at texturing.  I think a lot of that was due to the way Lightwave did textures.  It used to be extremely painful to texture a model because there wasn't really a good workflow..\n\nPreviously you'd have to export your UV's and do some texturing work in photoshop or some such, then import them back to the model, then render it... just to test your outcome.   It would take a long time to get something looking even half good.  It just wasn't easy workflow wise causing me not to want to do it.. thus, I sucked at it..\n\nModern day texturing is so much easier it's not even funny.  Now-a-days software allows you to directly paint on the model!  It's so awesome seeing your model update in near real time as you paint on it.\n\nIt's so powerful and so much easier to use.  The only thing you really need to use to take full advantage of that is a graphics tablet.   So this weekend, I went out and purchased a \"Bamboo\" Wacom tablet for $69.  What a steal!  This thing is awesome.   I realize there are several thousand dollar versions of this tablet and ot be honest I'm not sure what they bring to the table.  This tablet is fantastic and does such a great job I can't imagine needing anything else.\n\nI know they make a super expensive one that is also a monitor so you can see exactly what you're working on directly on the tablet, sure that'd be dang nice but other than that I don't know what the really expensive ones give you over the Bamboo.\n\nI'm very happy with it.  Modo 3D by Luxology is the 3D application I'm currently using to paint and model my stuff.  It is designed to use a pen and does so perfectly.  I still haven't quite mastered UV creation but I'm pretty close I think.  All in all the tablet was a good purchase and I would recommend one to anyone wanting to get that kind of detail out of their work.\n","previous":{"next":{"path":"_posts/2009-05-11-wacom-bamboo-graphics-tablet.md","url":"/wacom-bamboo-graphics-tablet/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-05-11-wacom-bamboo-graphics-tablet.md","id":"/wacom-bamboo-graphics-tablet","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Hobbies"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Wacom Bamboo Graphics Tablet","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2009/05/bamboo_wacom_2.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-05-11 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"wacom-bamboo-graphics-tablet","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2009-05-04-thorim.md","output":null,"content":"<img title=\"The Stormlord Thorin\" src=\"/images/2009/05/thorim-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"The Stormlord Thorin\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" class='pull-right' />\n\nYep..

But firstly let me say that Thorim is dead!  Long live Thorim.\n\nMy guild on Whisperwind is now only the second horde guild to kill Thorim in Ulduar.  He's a VERY tough fight.  I love it.  It took 25 people with their heads on a swivel, 100% focused with zero screw ups to make it happen.  (And even then it took us 17 tries.)\n\nBut we killed him and it was glorious!  It was an extremely difficult fight and I'm sure everyone will have a fun time with it..    Until they nurf him, of course.   Blizzard has taken it into their heads to nurf all the hard content and I wish they would STOP!\n\nBlizzard, stop nurfing the stuff in Ulduar.  As hard as he is, he's doable. Don't change it!  Let us scale to the instance instead of bringing the instance down to us.. He's just right the way he is!\n\nHe's doable..  Just as Ignis, Razorscale and Deconstructor were doable before you nurfed the hell out of them.  (Okay, Ignis had a bug with people in the pot.. fine that sucked, but he was still doable.. )\n\nThey were hard mobs that people bitched about so you caved and made them a cake walk!  You even nurfed the Ignis trash mobs to the point of pointlessness.. I mean why even have them in there?  They werent that hard to begin with..  Why are you doing this?!\n\nI read that some guilds couldn't even get to Ignis cause the trash was wiping them, then the issue is with the guild -- not the mobs.  Stop caving..\n\nDon't  you understand that we don't want another Naxx?  I mean seriously my guild can do 25man Naxx in a little over 2 hours.. it's boring.. I'm sure really top notch guild can do it faster..  It's not fun when you have the content on farm status so quickly.\n\nAfter the first round of nurfs, you guys went on and nurfed the Antechamber to the point where we one shot everyone.  Auriaya still takes some finesse but she's cake compared to how she first was.. Kologarn and Iron councel are a joke..\n\nI fully expect you to nurf the keepers next.  Freya isn't hard, again just a finesse issue but I'm sure you will reduce her spawns..   We usually drop her on the second or third attempt.  Good times!\n\nHodir we one shotted the first time we went in there, he's stupidly easy yet I bet he'll get nurfed even more.. We don't even use frost resist gear.. sheesh.. this guy needs a buff not a nurf..\n\nWe haven't tried 25 man Mimiron yet.. I'm told that it's another gloriously difficult fight.. *gleee*  I just hope we can get in there and give it a go before he gets pummeled with the nurf bat..\n\nLong story short.. stop making the content easier.  It's supposed to be hard!  What's the point of making top notch content only to then nurf it so that anyone can do it.. Believe it or not it's going to drive players away from your game.. and you don't want that..  Let the players scale up their performance to the point where they can do the content.. Don't bring the content down to players who have no business being in there..\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2009-04-13-world-of-warcraft-and-peta.md","url":"/world-of-warcraft-and-peta/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-04-13-world-of-warcraft-and-peta.md","id":"/world-of-warcraft-and-peta","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"World of Warcraft and PETA","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2009/04/sealclub.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-04-13 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"world-of-warcraft-and-peta","ext":".md"},"url":"/thorim/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-05-04-thorim.md","id":"/thorim","collection":"posts","excerpt":"Yep..

But to their point; Apparently a lot of seals (between 100k and 400k this year depending on which website you go to..) are killed annually by the Canadian government..  Or rather, their killing is sanctioned by the Canadian government..\n\nPETA's website goes on a very graphic tirade about how awful it is and how each seal \"must look on as fellow pups are bludgeoned to death before meeting the same bloody fate.  The anguish that a mother seal feels as she watches her baby being beaten to death just a few feet away from her is horrifying and can be heard in her desperate cries...\" Wow.. Nice spin.. Complete bullshit, but a good spin all the same..\n\nIn doing research for this, I have watched a lot of videos.. And in each video I have seen it has had some lone guy run up on an individual seemingly adult seal that was alone on an ice flow and repeatedly whack the seal in the head with a hammer on a pole.. Kinda gruesome true.. But PETA paints this as mass murder where all the baby seals are gathered up and executed Auschwitz style.. That simply isn't true..\n\nFirstly, I have no idea why the Canadian government has an annual seal season.  And from what I have read, no one else knows either..   There must be a reason, and despite what PETA thinks its not because they are all evil evil communists who hate children..  Thats how PETA paints it, but again.. not true..  That's propaganda..  There must be a reason it's legal -- what is it?\n\nApparently I'm willing to look at it a bit more objectively than PETA is;  It could be just like the deer season here in the US.. I simply don't know.  All the websites I have found on the issue are one manner of propaganda or another..  Finding hard facts is near impossible at this point because of all the inflammatory crap being flung back and forth..\n\nThe simple truth of it is;  If it's legal, then it's legal. You can be offended by it, but that doesn't mean that its against the law.  You can delve all you want into the morality pool and every one of us will come up with a different opinion on the subject.. But from a legal stand point, you can't say that killing seals is illegal.  It's not illegal.\n\nI personally think the primary difference is that seals are endearing..  It's sort of the same difference between a rat and a squirrel.. Squirrels are cute, we love them!  Rats are ugly, we hate them!  When the simple fact is they are both rodents that carry diseases, only one has a fluffy tail and lives outside which people find endearing thus squirrels are thought of more positively..  Seals are cute and as such we are offended by their early demise..\n\nI'm more than willing to concede that there are baby seals being killed out there on the ice flows.. Probably more than a few.. but to say that all the seals being killed are just cute cuddly wuddly baby seals is pure propaganda plain and simple.  Most folks that look at a picture of a seal have no idea how old that seal is..  Hell they all look like babies right?  I'm not 100% sure, but I thought seals out on the ice flow alone (as in the videos I saw) are adults, no baby seal would go out that far alone..\n\nHere is one of the videos I saw of seals being <a href=\"http://news.ebru.tv/en/americas/10775\" target=\"_blank\">clubbed to death</a>, and yes -- it's pretty gruesome.   But I would say it's no more gruesome than a deer getting shot during the annual hunting seasons here in the US..  How is that different?  It's an animal being killed by a superior species..  Just like a lion that chases down and kills a gazelle for it's meat..\n\nI eat meat.. The steak, pork and chicken that I consume also was once alive.. and is now dead..  And according to PETA I'm a murderer for it?  Really?  It's been going on for a long time.. And my maxillary permanent canine teeth sort of imply it was meant to go on.. So why does PETA think that this sort of activity is so bad?\n\nThey would answer that a lion wouldn't kill for sport, or wouldn't kill for just the skin.   To which I say; Sure they would and do all the time.   Dolphins are one of the more intelligent animals on the planet and they kill for sport..\n\nFrankly, this is just propaganda by an organization that has no power.. You see,  PETA wants to bring your attention to what they call, an injustice.. Something they call unethical..\n\nAnd since PETA has the word \"Ethical\" right in their name they must be good right?  The words right there, therefore they must be the ones doing the ethical and moral thing..  So if you disagree with them, then you're unethical!!  You bastard.\n\nThe problem is, it doesn't work that way.  Ethics are a system of moral principles governing an individual or group.  Those principles are discussed and agreed upon by that group.  No one individual or group can decide what those principles are for another individual or group.  Meaning, what's ethical here.. may not apply there.  What's moral and ethical for you may not apply to me..\n\nIn this situation you have PETA trying to tell another group what's ethically right, and if you don't do what they think is right you're wrong.   PETA is trying to control you and your way of thinking..   And they think you should DIE for disagreeing.  That's right..  Remember from above, they think the people killing the seals, should be killed...\n\nFrankly, I find that PETA is nothing more than a terrorist group (or even religious cult) that is extremely vocal and is very good at crafting sensational, vivid, graphic and even horrific language and imagery in order to manipulate people.   They do it in such a way as to make you feel bad if you don't side with them, and if that doesn't work they will intimidate, harass and threaten you..\n\nThat alone to me seems unethical.\n\nThe issue here is, like so many other animals in the animal kingdom (and yes, WE are animals) we tend to think animals are good to eat.. Most PETA members are vegetarians and as such have a moral stance that killing an animal of any kind for any reason is wrong.  Oh and they'll tell ya about it too.. We have differing ethical stances when it comes to the killing of animals.\n\nI'm all for not killing critters if we can get around it.. but sometimes it's necessary.. Like for food or for other products that we deem necessary.. Where as PETA paints this picture that we are torturing animals for our food.. Or that these seals are being tortured to death for their fur.  I haven't seen that.  I have yet to see where they hook up the car battery to the seals teets just to cause pain.  Or where they derive some sick pleasure from slapping a seal around..\n\nIn every video I have seen, they kill the animal in very short order.. It may take two or three whacks but its over and done fairly quickly..  How is that torture?   Torture to me implies the repeated infliction of pain over a period of time from which you derive some sick sadistic pleasure..  Walking up to an animal and bludgeoning it to death with intent to use it for one purpose or another, isn't torture..\n\nI have seen horrific and evil video of animals being tortured.. (Just watch the PETA website..)  Yeah that shits awful.. But that stuff is illegal and there are laws in place to stop it.   The seal hunts are legal, and not in the same category despite what you think.\n\nLook, I love animals.. I do.. I always have..  And I think the torture of animals is wrong and the people doing it should go away for ever.. But it's pretty clear to me that PETA loves animals more than Humans..\n\nPETA will try to tell you that animals are todays \"slaves\" and that what happens to a cow or a chicken today is morally identical to what happened to the Jewish people in the holocaust..  And that shit is fucking offensive as hell.. And I'm not Jewish!!  To actually trivialize the holocaust like that is just unimaginable and goes a very long way to prove that anyone who belongs to PETA has no basis in reality.\n\nHrmm.. maybe they belong in a game?\n","previous":{"next":{"path":"_posts/2009-04-13-world-of-warcraft-and-peta.md","url":"/world-of-warcraft-and-peta/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-04-13-world-of-warcraft-and-peta.md","id":"/world-of-warcraft-and-peta","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"World of Warcraft and PETA","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2009/04/sealclub.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-04-13 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"world-of-warcraft-and-peta","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2009-04-06-2009-penny-redesign.md","output":null,"content":"<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2009/04/2009pennyuncobvthumb.jpg\" class='fancybox pull-right'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-382\" title=\"2009pennyuncobvthumb\" src=\"/images/2009/04/2009pennyuncobvthumb.jpg\" alt=\"2009 Penny Front\" width=\"150\" height=\"120\" /><br /><span>2009 Penny Front</span></a>\n\nSo I wasn't terribly shocked to find a brand new penny in my hand upon receiving change for the breakfast I purchased this morning..  I was however shocked to see that they have been completely redesigned!!\n\nApparently 2009 was the bicentennial of Abraham Lincoln's birth and as such four new designs were commissioned and released to celebrate that as well as the 100th anniversary of the production of the Lincoln cent (penny).\n\nI have to think that Lincoln would be embarrassed...\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2009/04/2009-penny.jpg\" class='fancybox pull-left'><img title=\"2009-penny\" src=\"/images/2009/04/2009-penny-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"2009 Pennies!\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>click to enlarge</span></a>\n\nThe front design is the same as it was, but the reverse has 4 new designs apparently featuring four major aspects of President Lincoln's life;  his birth and childhood in Kentucky, his formative years in Indiana, his professional life in Illinois, and his Presidency in Washington, D.C as seen to the right.\n\nI'm okay with the first two.. The log cabin and the rail-splitter designs are nice and seem appropriate to me.  The last two are also nice designs but I question how those images were more relevant to Lincolns life than say; the Emancipation Proclamation, or the Lincoln-Doublas Debates on the topic of Slavery. or something related to the Gettysburg Address maybe? etc..\n\nI'm just not sure that a picture of the Capitol cluttered by scaffolding was a good salute to Lincoln's life.\n\nBut most importantly;  Dear god, WHY?! ... why do this?  Amid all the government bailouts, corporate bankruptcies, and an economic down turn to rival that of the great depression, how much money did the government blow to redesign those coins?\n\nNo one forges the penny so why redesign it?  Did the old designs some how fail?  Not only that but these 4 new designs during 2009 are mandated to be further redesigned again in 2010 to a permanent design.\n\nIs this some effort to instill value in an almost valueless coin? I'm sure all the numismatists will appreciate it.. Or maybe it's bizarro feel good tactic by the government to cheer us up?  I dunno..  But the amount of money that was bound to be put into this redesign process seems silly.  Especially in an age where the penny seems largely pointless.  Most people don't stop to pick pennies up off the ground..\n\nTo be fair; No they aren't worthless.. think how much everything would go up if you had to round up to the nearest nickel.. but still..\n\nAt one point (prior to 1982) all US pennies actually had a metal content that at market value was worth more than face value of the coin. Now however, all pennies are 97.5% zinc with only 2.5% being copper (coated over the zinc) and as such have an intrinsic value of $0.0028... So 0.28% of face value..\n\nAccording to the US Mint the costs to producing and shipping already designed one-cent (penny) coins during the fiscal year 2007 was $0.0167 per penny.[<a href=\"http://www.usmint.gov/downloads/about/annual_report/2007AnnualReport.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">ref</a>]  That doesn't count the cost of redesign..\n\n$0.0167 to produce a coin worth $0.0028, with a face value of only $0.01..    Dear god no wonder we are in debt..\n\nSo, 5 billion pennies in circulation worth $50 million dollars, cost the government $70 million to make..  For those of you who are really bad at math, thats $20 million dollars wasted..\n\nI have to think even Lincoln would be ashamed..\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2009-04-03-2009cruise.md","url":"/2009cruise/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-04-03-2009cruise.md","id":"/2009cruise","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Cruise Photos","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/cruise/Cruise%20046.jpg","ribbon":null,"tile_size":"3x2","private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-04-03 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"2009cruise","ext":".md"},"url":"/2009-penny-redesign/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-04-06-2009-penny-redesign.md","id":"/2009-penny-redesign","collection":"posts","excerpt":"So I wasn't terribly shocked to find a brand new penny in my hand upon receiving change for the breakfast I purchased this morning..  I was however shocked to see that they have been completely redesigned!!","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"2009 Penny Redesign","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2009/04/2009pennyuncobvthumb.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-04-06 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"2009-penny-redesign","ext":".md"},"url":"/world-of-warcraft-and-peta/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-04-13-world-of-warcraft-and-peta.md","id":"/world-of-warcraft-and-peta","collection":"posts","excerpt":"So, on Saturday the 11th of April, PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) held an awareness gathering in World of Warcraft where they killed four quest NPC's as a form of protest for the unethical killing of seals in real life.","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"World of Warcraft and PETA","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2009/04/sealclub.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-04-13 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"world-of-warcraft-and-peta","ext":".md"},"url":"/thorim/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-05-04-thorim.md","id":"/thorim","collection":"posts","excerpt":"Yep..
