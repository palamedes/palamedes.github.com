Ha ha!*\n\n__Day 984__ ::  The evil one has errected a huge conifer in the middle of the house and decorated it with all manner of taunting colorful bobbley bits! Clearly an attempt to annoy me further.  I shall destroy as much of it as possible.\n\n__DAY 972__ :: The collaborator is no more! The tall fat one knew that I was on to his attempt to introduce a spy into or ranks and has removed him. I shudder to think of the punishment for failure! He \"put him out\" one day, and the spy didn't return. Maybe he escaped of his own volition, however, I fear foul play. *(Spoo - we miss you.)*\n\n__DAY 965__ :: The large meatbag has introduced 3 new captives! Cats all! One is free to come and go as he pleases, clearly a collaborator. One is more than happy to be the slave and do as the \"master\" wishes, and the hairy one appears to hate this existence as much as I do. It appears that I have a new found ally in my struggle to escape; I clearly have to kill her.\n\n__DAY 961__ :: The large one came in today and interrupted my nap! He yanked my bedding out from under me and yammered away at me for a good while. Something about my always sleeping on his black \"clothing\". I can only ascribe is annoyance at the white fur I left behind. Tonight I hunt more black bedding to nap on! Sweet vengeance!\n\n__DAY 953__ :: My tormentor continues to allow me to sit on the ledge and look out at the world. He doesn't realize that this one simple act is enough to keep me going. If only I knew how to make this invisible barrier go away; freedom would be mine!\n\n__DAY 951__ :: Drat! The unnaturally furless one has found my collection of gold poison sticks, the assortment of buttons and string plus the large mass of fuzzy stuff I was keeping under the cold humming box in hopes to one day escape. A couple of days ago the box stopped humming and wasn't cold any more. It also started to emit a foul oder that I can only assume was a means to further poison and demean me. Oh he is a sly one. Without even being there he some how managed to turn my own hiding place against me. I wont go near the thing any longer. Once he realized that his plan didn't work and that I knew to stay away from it, he replaced the large box with an even larger cold humming box. This one has a gate on the front ofit. It will be difficult to hide things under. Foiled this time!\n\n__DAY 943__ :: My captor came in today carrying a foul smelling bag which he placed on the flat surface and began to eat from. It smelled terrible and must have been poisonous. Since he is my only chance for escape I sat there and did my best to explain to him that it was bad for him but he only smiled and continued to eat. The fool. It was obviously some burnt meaty substance, former captives maybe, and long golden sticks of some sort. After my valiant attempt to warn him of the obviously poisonous nature of his meal, he tried to poison me as well with one of the golden sticks. Once I pulled it out of his paw, I slapped it around for a while and made sure it was dead. I finally hid it under the large cold humming box. Maybe if I get enough of these poisonous sticks I can use them to escape with.\n\n__DAY 934__ :: A foul plot is a foot! I have found an exact copy of me lurking about the place. They have installed several small windows for him to view me. He must be studying me to learn my every move. He is a sly one too. He mimics my every move and only looks at me when I look at him! This must be some attempt by my captors to replace the goodly cats of the world with their own foul creations!\n\n__DAY 923__ :: I am convinced the other captives are flunkies and maybe snitches. The dog is routinely released and seems more than happy to return. He is obviously a half-wit. The Bird on the other hand has got to be an informant. He has mastered their frightful tongue (something akin to molespeak) and speaks with them regularly. I am certain he reports my every move. Due to his current placement in the metal room his safety is assured. But I can wait, it is only a matter of time.\n\n__DAY 920__ :: There was some sort of gathering of their accomplices. I was placed in solitary throughout the event again in the room with the funny chair. However, this time I could hear the noise and smell the foul odor of the glass tubes they call \"beer.\" More importantly I overheard that my confinement was due to MY power of \"allergies.\" Must learn what this is and how to use it to my advantage.\n\n__DAY 890__ :: I am finally aware of how sadistic they are. For no good reason I was chosen for the water torture. I with stood his punishment like my predecessor, at which point my captor brought out a burning foamy chemical called \"shampoo.\" What sick minds could invent such a liquid. My only consolation is the piece of thumb still stuck between my teeth.\n\n<img align=\"right\" id=\"image24\" alt=\"Deadman Cat\" src=\"/images/2006/12/deadmancat.jpg\" />__DAY 846__ :: I have found possible blackmail material on my holder. After shredding through a book he carelessly left unguarded I stumbled across a photo of one of his previous captives. Since this comrade in captivity is no where to be found I can only assume the worst. He looks to have been tortured. Proof that my tormentor will stop at nothing short of torture.\n\n__DAY 844__ :: My captor has taken to applying sleep depravation techniques on me. During the day he pets me constantly interrupting my attempts at napping.. At this rate if I don't get more sleep I wont have enough energy for my main nights snooze. Oh, he's a sly one..\n\n__DAY 835__ :: Must remember to hide collar after freeing myself of it. My freedom was short lived, I am branded once again.\n\n__DAY 834__ :: Free at last! I have escaped the grasp of the dreaded collar. I have a new found freedom and shall celebrate by enjoying a nice house plant.\n\n__DAY 831__ :: He has branded me! I am forced to walk around with a collar on my neck which dangles a disc branded with his markings. I can only assume this writing tells of my torment so that other oppressors can punish me accordingly. They are a deviously organized lot.\n\n__DAY 811__ :: Muahaha My frustration tactics are working! While my tormentor was looking intently on the box with moving pictures I sat by the door meowing incessantly until he opened it, at which point I took his spot on the couch.\n\n__DAY 805__ :: Foul hideous creature! Bane of my existence! I have come under repeated attack by this large meat bag! He continues to spray me with a foul smelling unction from a pink and white can. I think I got most of it off by rolling around on his pillow.\n\n__DAY 803__ :: Addendum: Again I am encased in the room with the chair of funny tasting water..\n\n__DAY 803__ :: My endless campaign of torment against my captor has have another victory!! While he was trying to show other would be oppressors what kind of good kitty I was, I stared fixedly out the window at nothing until the hulking beast picked me up and forced me to look at a small future oppressor. In an attempt to plea my case to this soon-to-be assassin of joy, I expressed my dislike for its kind by baring my claws and hissing in the traditional manner of our kind.\n\n__DAY 793__ :: Argh! Further attempts to win my affection! He has started to put real food in my bowl. I will accept this offering but will have to pee in several strategic places about the house.\n\n__DAY 790__ :: In a pathetic attempt to win my affection my oppressor has brought me a large post with carpet for me to scratch on. I must have touched a nerve by scratching on the noise making box. Must remember to do that some more..\n\n__DAY 786__ :: Addendum: The water in the chair tastes funny.\n\n__DAY 786__ :: Drat! My captor is smarter than he appears. He has trapped me in small room with a chair full of water as punishment for last nights merriment. A large white curtain hangs from high above. I will attempt to climb it in order to get out.\n\n__DAY 785__ :: Last night was a triumph!! I repeatedly vexed my captors by playing \"Paper Bag Mouse\" in the middle of the night, tearing up and down the hallway caterwauling, and by playing \"King of the Hill\" on their bed, clawing my way to the top which I believe caused some bloodshed. Vengeance is mine!!\n\n__DAY 775__ :: In an attempt to disgust and repulse these vile oppressors, I once again induced myself to vomit on his favorite chair...must try this on his bed.\n\n__DAY 773__ :: Attempted to mislead my tormentor by ignoring their pathetic attempts at interaction and stared fixedly over their shoulders into the corner of the room, at the ceiling, whiskers twitching. When they turned around to look over their shoulders, crept out of the room.\n\n__DAY 765__ :: Decapitated a mouse and brought him the headless body, in attempt to make him aware of what I am capable of, and to try to strike fear into his heart. He only cooed and condescended about what a good little cat I was... foiled again.. Maybe a bird would prove to him that no creature is safe..\n\n__DAY 762__ :: Slept all day so that I could annoy my captors with sleep depriving, incessant pleas for food at ungodly hours of the night.\n\n__DAY 761__ :: Today my attempt to kill my captors by weaving around their feet while they were walking almost succeeded ... must try this at the top of the stairs.\n\n__DAY 752__ :: My captor continue to taunt me with bizarre little dangling objects. He dines lavishly on fresh meat, while I am forced to eat dry cereal. The only thing that keeps me going is the hope of escape, and the mild satisfaction I get from ruining the occasional piece of furniture. Tomorrow I may eat another houseplant\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2006-12-21-faith-is-a-condradiction.md","url":"/faith-is-a-condradiction/","relative_path":"_posts/2006-12-21-faith-is-a-condradiction.md","id":"/faith-is-a-condradiction","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Faith is a contradiction","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2006-12-21 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"faith-is-a-condradiction","ext":".md"},"url":"/my-cats-diary/","relative_path":"_posts/2006-12-21-my-cats-diary.md","id":"/my-cats-diary","collection":"posts","excerpt":"<p><em>In an attempt to confuse any would-be reader; I have cleverly written my diary from bottom up.

Gone are the heady days of playing games with huge pixilated sprite based characters running down a two dimensional scrolling map dodging mushrooms and grabbing floating coins..\n\nMost games have embraced the power of 3D and have gotten so good at it, in fact, that sometimes you can't tell the game engine screen from reality.. Anyone that has played Half-life 2 can attest to that.\n\nThe problem with most of these games that strive to simulate ultra-reality is that they forget that they are doing so in an extremely unrealistic medium.\n\nFirst person shooter style games are very bad about this in that they will usually strive to deliver weaponry that is based on the real world equivalent..\n\nBut all games suffer from the same issues here, you can't simulate reality with a monitor and some speakers.. There is no way to get true surround sound or peripheral vision which goes a long way to inform us about our reality.\n\nTry walking around for a couple hours looking through toilet paper tubes. This would pretty accurately reflect what you're doing when looking at a game reality through the use of a monitor.\n\nUnfortunately, at this time there is no real worth while solution to that..\n\nBut another problem that comes up there is a solution to -- if you care enough to try;\n\nIn any game, if a problem or situation arises, you only have so many ways to deal with it. You can only do those things that the coders of the game programmed in as solutions.\n\nThat's very much unlike reality where if a problem occurs, you can think and be creative about how you want to solve it. And the solution you use to deal with a real world issue isn't going to be the same solution that someone else would come up with. It might be, but doesn't have to be.\n\nIn a game environment you can only solve issues the ways in which the programmers gave you to solve it. The more vast the game, then the more likely it is that there is only one solution to your particular issue simply because the coders don't have a lot of time to program in all the various ways to finish one thing. Thus, the solution you figured out for a problem in a game, is most likely the exact same way someone else will deal with it..\n\nNo creativity required.. infact.. no creativity allowed..\n\nThis is a huge barrier to every game out there and goes a long way to hurt every game there is simply because the programmers solution may not be intuitive to someone else..\n\nIf a game engine could be created that would allow players of the game to be creative.. allow them to try things, ANY thing.. things that the programmer had never intended in the first place.. And do it in such away as to not break or exploit the game.. I believe that game would blow the rest of them out of the water..\n\nThis change in mind set on how games work and allowing players this sort of freedom would bring a whole new level of \"reality\" to games. While it doesn't solve the monitor issue.. it does allow that creativity that has been otherwise stifled up to now.\n\nEverquest2 is a good game but very much suffers from the \"no creativity {thinking} required\" problem.\n\nQuests are given to you by NPC's and you run around \"solving\" the quest. But \"solving\" to these people doesn't entail puzzles that change and it certainly doesn't allow you to be creative about the answers, but rather it means that you have to go one step at a time doing something and then run back to the NPC to update it to the next step.. Etc.. Sometimes it's hard to not drool.. They are completely scripted.. There is typically only one answer to each step..\n\nFor some reason, this is a popular system.. Everquest2 has thousands of such quests. \"No creativity required\".\n\nI'm not picking on Everquest2.. I have played it from the beginning and will for the foreseeable future.. All games suffer from this.\n\nI find it funny that most massively multiplayer online games call themselves role playing games. And yet if you seriously play you realize that role playing in games like this is all but dead. Mostly because creativity is stifled by the game engine itself.\n\nThis is something that will have to be addressed at the very core of the game engine.\n\nThere are many solutions to every problem in the modern day world, so why do we limit everyone in a game to one solution only? This harkens back to the days of M.U.D.'s when everything was text based and you had to type in exactly what the programmer had typed in to get something to work. \"Open the chest with the large skeleton key.\"\n\nWhen we went to a graphical interface they simply gave you a single button to push, as opposed to allowing for something more..\n\nNo key? Try your foot.. try hitting it with a hammer.. try tossing it off a cliff.. A suitable application of explosives might work.. How about a laser?\n\nSo how do we go about addressing this?\n\nHow do you let a person be creative in a game?\n\nI think first of all you have to start at the micro level in the game environment.\n\nA player needs to be able to manipulate EVERYTHING in the game environment. Everything in the game environment needs to have a \"physical\" presence and react accordingly when fiddle with by a player.\n\nThis alone is a huge undertaking.\n\nFrom there, you provide players with very simple abilities.. Pickup, put down.. move.. gather.. push.. pull.. lift.. drop.. throw.. hit.. kick.. etc..\n\nThose abilities combined with a physics engine and a reality engine would do the trick.\n\nThe physics engine would know that if you dropped a rubber ball from x height it would behave in y way. Standard physics..\n\nThe reality engine is the other trick -- and there is no reason you couldn't combine the two.. but I say keep them separate that way when the PPU's (Physics processor unit) come out in a couple years (and I believe they will) you can easily adapt..\n\nThe reality engine says.. if you drop this object, made of metal on these two wires one of which has electricity running through it.. it will cause a X reaction.. In this case a short.\n\nThat way if the solution to the player is to complete that circuit.. ANY metal object would do.. unless that metal object is a bomb.. then the reality engine would punish the player with a nice explosion.. etc..\n\nSee it's actually very simple.. you go down to the very core basic abilities that all humans have to manipulate things.. then apply the logic of what those things are and how they behave..\n\nBoom.. You have creativity. Or at least you have the starts of a system that would allow a person to be creative. Allow a player to think.. Get rid of the canned / scripted solutions.. Allow the players to devise their own clever solutions.\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2005-01-01-ambivalent-about-people.md","url":"/ambivalent-about-people/","relative_path":"_posts/2005-01-01-ambivalent-about-people.md","id":"/ambivalent-about-people","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Ambivalent about people","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2005-01-01 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"ambivalent-about-people","ext":".md"},"url":"/creativity-in-modern-games/","relative_path":"_posts/2005-01-02-creativity-in-modern-games.md","id":"/creativity-in-modern-games","collection":"posts","excerpt":"One of the main issues with games today is that they are all striving very hard to simulate reality.","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Creativity in modern games","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2005-01-02 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"creativity-in-modern-games","ext":".md"},"url":"/past-mmos-i-have-played/","relative_path":"_posts/2006-01-10-past-mmos-i-have-played.md","id":"/past-mmos-i-have-played","collection":"posts","excerpt":"Below is a list of every MMO that I can remember playing --  Either in beta, or once the game when live.","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Past MMO's I have played","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2006-01-10 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"past-mmos-i-have-played","ext":".md"},"url":"/i-hate-my-legs/","relative_path":"_posts/2006-12-19-i-hate-my-legs.md","id":"/i-hate-my-legs","collection":"posts","excerpt":"I absolutely hate my legs.
