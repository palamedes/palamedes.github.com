<p>Amateur / Fan Films Forum was created in back in early 2000  and was made up of a small community of amateur and fan film enthusiasts..  We came together as a community and over time became a family of like minded individuals who enjoyed spending time and sharing information with one another..</p>

<p>The forum originally went through many iterations, administered by few different &quot;owners&quot; and hosted by several different free forum hosting companies..   A year or so after it&#39;s inception it came into my care and I have treated it as best I could ever since..   The forum had over 4000 users over the course of its many iterations who contributed to over 175,000 posts..      It had a core of about 50 users, people with more than 2000 posts individually, and about 20 who were hard core posters with 5000+ posts individually who stuck with the from through its various iterations, owner switching, and software changes..</p>

<p>Over the course of the forums life in my hands, I have hosted it with a couple different services,  pointed 6 domains to it and used four different forum software solutions (Invision Power Board was by far the best).   During all this time I spent a lot of time and effort (not to mention money) keeping up with it.  It grew and did quite well for itself for a while, but as with all things there comes a decline..   Peoples interests change, and life must go on.   All of the core users have moved on to bigger and better things, and as a result the forum is a moon cast shadow of it&#39;s former self -- I think the time has finally come to say goodbye.</p>

<p>At this point it&#39;s starting to degenerate into haunt for bots who post unwanted spam and frankly I&#39;m tired of dealing with it.   I shall archive the data on the forums forever and am always here and open to discuss the forum and the contents thereof.  But the board it self will come down to save me the bandwidth and the bot headaches..</p>

<p>Please feel free to email me at the address below if you have any comments, suggestions or just want to chat..  You may also post a comment here if you like.. I&#39;d love to hear from each of the old school core posters telling everyone what the forum meant to you..  I know I personally got more out of it than I put in or I wouldn&#39;t have continued to do it..  ( and no I don&#39;t mean money -- I never made a cent.. )</p>

<p>Either way, it was a good ride..  I want to give a personal thank you to all the users who made the forum what it was,  to the few that donated their time to upkeep as well as to the even fewer who donated money..  I also want to thank the core 50 and the hard core 20 who really provided the center around which we all revolved, you know who you are..</p>

<p>I shall miss you all, and I wish you all the best.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">  To all of those I met and became friends with through the FFF, I must say a heartfelt thanks. I learned more about film production through this forum than through any other source. It’s sad to see the forum come down, but it seemed past its glory days for sure. I shall always remember the kind individuals that read my scripts, offered feedback on my effects tests, gave me advice about all kinds of topics, and listened to my own ramblings as I tried to coach others on their way to success. To all of my friends on the “other side of the pond” I want to thank you for your friendship. You darn Yanks were good friends too, and this isn’t the end of such friendships, just a change of venue. I expect to hear from all of you when you make it big.  Good luck to everyone in all that you do. If you ever need to get in touch with me, just google my name. It’s unique enough for you to find me.  Take care all.

I’m still active in no-budget filmmaking and many of the skills and techniques that I use were learned from my friends on the board.

  Jason, thanks for taking on the time and money burdens to host the board all these years. If anyone wants to keep in touch with me or collaborate on a project, please feel free to email me at kwkspectre@yahoo.com.

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">  It’s a real shame but I understand the need to pull the plug. Thank you for the time, effort and of course money you invested in keeping it running, even when it began to seem not worth it. The FFF meant a lot to me, even though film making was never first on my agenda I still have an ambition to someday make a feature-length film. I learnt a lot of handy techniques and met some great friends who taught me much for when I finally realize this ambition. I went to the liberty of creating a group for all of our members on Facebook, just search for ‘Amateur Films Forum’. Hopefully we can find a way for it to carry on, in whatever form or capacity. Good luck to everyone in all your endeavours, especially film related! Take care.

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">  Though I was only a member for about five years, they were a crucial five years, and in them I became an adult. With you people’s companionship, I grew from a fanatic blathering idiot to a nihilistic, muttering idiot, and for that I am thankful. From Utah to London, and probably some others outside my limited geographical knowledge, I made many true friends that I would not otherwise have met. They have enriched me, and, I like to think, I have enriched them even more, as I think we can all agree I was the coolest of all of us, and also the sexiest.

  Except, perhaps, for Wondernerd.

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">  I was guided here from the FFF Facebook group, I hadn’t realized the forum had been taken down. I haven’t been around much in recent years, however, I grew up on the FFF. Since I was probably 12(?) I started posting on the original ezboard (none of you have any clue besides Jason), but I got to know many folks over the years and most all of them have gone on to other things since. I nearly shed a tear reading this, Jason as it occupied some 10 years of my life. Although fan films, and films in general, aren’t much of my life anymore, the films, knowledge, memories, and most of all the friends from this community will never be forgotten. Thank you all, and most importantly Jason for keeping it alive as long as you did. Feel free to add me on Facebook or whatnot.

  Take care,

  Palamedes, your forum became my go-to site when other forums lost the ideals of what fan films are all about. Thanks for all of the blood, sweat, tears and cash you’ve put into the site. It’s made my writing and filmmaking better.

  To the friends I’ve made, It is my sincere wish to stay in touch and hopefully collaborate on projects. While I don’t get to make as many as I’d like, I got my son involved in filmmaking, and now I’m also the VP of a film festival, thanks to the info I learned from you.

  I’d love to hear from you. Drop me a line at jp@stunodpictures.com

  Thanks for all you have done with this board. Not only did it help in the completion of 2 SW Fan Films, but also helped us move on into the non-fan film world. Hell, you even helped point me in the right direction when I needed a board of my own for a class I was teaching. I met a lot of really good people here and wish you all the best of luck.

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">  Oh my gosh! I hadn’t checked the forum in a long time. I first met up with all of you when I was just a young lad. I think I was 13 or 14. I learned a lot there, and everybody really helped me enjoy video, the internet, and my youth. Such a strong community back then.

  I eventually drifted away as school took more of my time and I started running around with some kids in town. Right now, though, I am in my last semester of film school at Columbia College Chicago and I think I owe all of you at least a little bit of thanks for fanning the flame when I was just starting to light the fire. You all rock!

  And Jason (Pal), I still remember when you took over as the forum’s chief custodian. What an undertaking.

  Y’know, when I look around today at sites like Vimeo and Youtube – sites I use often – I think back on what we were all doing and I think, really, we were a step ahead. We needed the community back then because we didn’t have the tools. Now the distribution and collaborative tools are available and communities are forming around them! It is a truly exciting time for creativity.

  I invite any of you who remember me, or even those who don’t but want to get to know me, to join me on Vimeo. My profile is linked above.

  I wish you all the best! I have such fond memories of our time together apart.

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">  End of an era for sure Dave.

  The enthusiasm of youth must give way to the realities of life.

  It was a long ride. It was a good ride. So many laughs. So much creativity. So many dreams, some fulfilled, others not. But it was great to share those dreams with all of you. It made them seem more real.

  It brings a smile to my face when I think of all the kids who have now grown up. I think of Sh4rk and Zayn, and DMaul who were mature beyond their years.

  I remember the old guard. Names like Movie Maximus, Douz and G’rn, Clay, Hermes, AlanSmithee, NetVudu, Wondernerd, Melvil, SovereignKnight, Jason R.J.M., Jedi2016. (I’m forgetting so many, but google cache won’t show anything from fanfilmsforum.com and my work is blocking wayback machine).

  Hats off to Japheth for creating our common home and to Palamedes for safeguarding it until now. I completely understand your decision, as sad as it makes me. (is it available in read-only mode somewhere, there was a wealth of information in those posts).

  Cheers to you all. Hope you are well and happy.

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">  At home I was able to have a look with web.archive.org and found a bunch of old names I’d forgotten:

  Jedi_Rory, Saint Storyteller, Kreve Streak, Jedi Roara, goddess, Darth Brass, Tater, Han_Duet, Jareth Dakk and Tcheb.

  Remember ScottMiddlebrook? and Dorkmanscott, and who can forget DMAN. KepowOb, and EdgeofNowhere. There was Anrev, and Bryan, and Crunchy, and sledgeweb.

  I remeber Pszabo99, Xecuter666, Andrew Breecher, Jarn Tal and Khyron.

  So many names. So many memories.

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">  Not sure how many people here actually remember me. I kind of go way back. Back to even the ezboard days and then over to this forum. But for some reason I just figured I’d drop by and see what everyone was up to and I can honestly say I’m sad to see the board no longer in existence. I was going through my closet the other day, opening boxes of stuff from when I moved many years ago and came across my garb (X-Wing helmet and coveralls) I had purchased for the long planned, but never created Tales from the Holocron project. But anyway, hope everyone is doing well. Hello to those who remember me. Take care.

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">  The FFF was the first message board I ever joined! I started reading back in the ezboard days when I was just beginning to explore the world of video. I was just a kid, and it was great to interact with a community of people who all had the same budding interest.

  I ended up going to college for Digital Media, and had some great experiences working with video, animation, and compositing for class projects, and on an internship where I helped to start the video program at Philly.com/The Philadelphia Inquirer. I get to create a lot of multimedia at my current job (and do some corporate video, and even some animation).

  I owe a lot of who I am as a content designer today to my infancy at the FFF. I don’t think I was ever huge poster, and didn’t really get too far with the projects I was working on at the time, but I certainly learned a lot of basic film making skills, terminology, and a lot about the film making process–and a lot of other knowledge I still use almost daily.

  Jason, and everyone else from the old days: Thanks for helping to facilitate such an important part of my upbringing, and for building the foundation of my career!

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">  I feel like a dagger was placed into my heart and twisted. Reading these comments is WAY sad as I recall my own experience. I must have joined the forums when I was 14 just a young lad, and I learned so much stuff as I developed into a more professional videographer. It’s crazy how time has passed so fast. I’m 21 now! NUTS! Well thanks FFF.
  and I’d like to cordially blame facebook and blogger for the death of this once great empire… Adeuix (however you spell it)

  well if anyone wants to contact me. Shoot me an email hardbed34@gmail.com especially my Utah home boys! peice out!

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">Wow, this was truly a difficult thing to find. I definitely understand taking the boards down, like so many others I too drifted away as my life changed, and it was always somewhat painful to see the activity decline in recent years. But like many others, this community played a huge part in my life. I couldn’t have been more than 13 or 14 when I joined, and I feel like I’ve grown up knowing a lot of you.

Many thanks to all the awesome people that made the FFF such a special place. I wish you all the very best.

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">  Wow, I just got on and went to see what was up at the old forum since the last time I was here (I don’t even remember when the last time was). I’m sad to see it gone, but I can understand why.

  Myself, and many others, have moved on to other things in life. I still remember the old days and the old friends, and always will.

  I have a MySpace account, but rarely use it (about as often as I had been on the forum the last several years). I suppose I need to get a Facebook account one of these days, but somehow, I don’t see myself using it very much either. So many people I know are on it though, so maybe one day, just before it becomes obsolete, lol!

  I just want to thank everyone who has ever been a part of the FFF over the years, you all are great friends and advisors! It was a great little corner of the internet we had for ourselves.

Well, as much as I hate to admit it, I guess you’re right, Pal. Would have loved to keep the novelization going!
