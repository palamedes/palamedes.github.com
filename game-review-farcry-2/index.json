I mean what the hell kind of customer support is this?  (None is the right answer.)\n\nSince WotLK came out I have been getting #134 errors. I am a software engineer by trade and understand that software is complex and I am more than willing to work with them to fix this.. I just wish they would stop blaming me (and/or my computer) for it.\n\nTo date I have noticed two things that I think are important and that bear mentioning;\n\n1.  This only happens to me after I have been playing the game for a couple of hours (memory leak?)\n2.  This only happens to me when I am flying either on a flight path or on my own flying mount.\n\nIts always a ReadSectors/DecompressData error.\n\nThings I have tried and it still happened;\n\na. __New Drivers / Old Drivers__ -- I have updated every driver ont he system to the latest and even tried older ones..\n\nb. __Higher resolution / Lower resolution__ -- I have tried playing the game from 1680x1050 to 800x600 (this was painful) and it still happened.\n\nc. __High graphics / Low graphics__ -- I have played with Max graphics settings (to include forcing AA through my nvidia drivers) and I have played with everything turned down and off.\n\nd. __Lots of addons / No addons__ -- I have played the game with all my addons cranked up and going, and no addons.. Questhelper seemed to exacerbate the issue so I have removed it, but I dont think it was the problem as its been gone for a while and its still a problem.\n\ne. __Scan Disk and Defrag__ -- at this point my machines harddrive is probably tired of me doing this\n\nf. __Deleted the wtf files, cache folder and other various bits__ -- at this point there is nothing left of my install from when I originally had the problem. I have completely moved the install, its in a different place physically on the drive. I continue to do what others suggest via the forum and nothing seems to help.\n\ng. __Run the repair tool__ -- I do this every time it happens and it does fix the problem for a time. Note however that its only a temporary fix. It does happen again forcing me to rerun the tool. Sometimes its a quick fix (15 minutes or so) other times it says its \"really corrupt\" and has to restore from an older version or something.. then update via the patcher. this takes a while and sucks when I'm trying to do a 25man naxx..\n\n#### Computer information:\n\nBoard: EVGA 122-CK-NF68 running the Nvidia nForce 680i SLI SPP chipset\n\nProcessor: Intel Core 2 Extreme Quad Core Qx6700 @ 2666 Mhz\n\nMemory: 2048mb (2x1024 DDR2)..

I don't overclock or any of that nonsense.\n\nI run the game on a single 24 inch monitor at 1680x1050 32bit\n\nSo far all I have gotten is worthless and often conflicting responses..  Not to mention the snarky and rude comments from the various mods that \"help\"..   Hell at this point the users are actually apologizing for the mods and the lack of help...\n\n*sigh*\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2008-10-30-jack-tompson-has-been-disbarred.md","url":"/jack-tompson-has-been-disbarred/","relative_path":"_posts/2008-10-30-jack-tompson-has-been-disbarred.md","id":"/jack-tompson-has-been-disbarred","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Jack Tompson has been disbarred","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-10-30 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"jack-tompson-has-been-disbarred","ext":".md"},"url":"/wow134/","relative_path":"_posts/2008-12-22-wow134.md","id":"/wow134","collection":"posts","excerpt":"The Blue Mods at the Blizzard World of Warcraft forums asked me to post about my problems so I did... again..","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"World of Warcraft and Error #134","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-12-22 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"wow134","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2008-10-30-jack-tompson-has-been-disbarred.md","output":null,"content":"Bhahhahahahaha... So, the infamous anti-gaming crusader Jack Thompson has finally met his match in the form of the Florida Supreme Court who this week permanently disbarred him while in the background the announcer yelled \"headshot\" for all to see his shame..\n\nOkay that last bit may be a lie, but the rest is true. They stated that the disbarment was to take effect 30 days after the initial hearing back in September in order to allow him to shut down his practice.  Of course, being the douche bag that he is, he immediately filed his own emergency motion with the court in order to seek a retrial, however another Bar member would have had to vouch for him because they stated \"no motion for rehearing will be considered unless signed by a member in good standing with the Florida Bar\" which didn't happen.\n\nI think most lawyers were smart enough to stay away from this one..  And now a month later, his career as an attorney is over in Florida... Anyone wanna bet he will move?\n\nThe full press release says;\n   \n    Miami attorney Jack Thompson, nationally and internationally known by virtue of his effective and successful opposition over the last 20 years to the broadcast, marketing, and sale of adult-rated entertainment to children, has just been informed by the Florida Supreme Court that he has been disbarred from the practice of law today.\n\n    The timing of this disbarment transparently reveals its motivation: This past Friday Thompson filed a federal civil rights action against The Bar, the Supreme Court, and all seven of its Justices. This rush to disbarment is in retribution for the filing of that federal suit. With enemies this foolish, Thompson needs only the loyal friends he has.\n\n    Thompson looks forward to successfully litigating his federal claims, now before US District Court Judge Marcia Cooke in the Southern District of Florida.\n\n    Thompson always wanted to own a Bar. Now, armed with multiple US Supreme Court rulings that no state bar can do what it has done to Thompson, he is set to own that Bar.\n\nAll in all I think its somewhat amusing and I'm sure he doesn't realize that this whole thing is his own fault.  After 30 years of being an attorney in Flordia, the court finally had enough of his shit and he is officially \"Not Eligible to practice in Florida\".\n\nI'm sure he isn't done.  He will continue to weasel his way around the game industry causing problems and being a general annoyance.   I'm sure he'd blame my opinion on games.\n","previous":{"next":{"path":"_posts/2008-10-30-jack-tompson-has-been-disbarred.md","url":"/jack-tompson-has-been-disbarred/","relative_path":"_posts/2008-10-30-jack-tompson-has-been-disbarred.md","id":"/jack-tompson-has-been-disbarred","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Jack Tompson has been disbarred","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-10-30 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"jack-tompson-has-been-disbarred","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2008-10-28-game-review-farcry-2.md","output":null,"content":"<img title=\"farcry2pc\" src=\"/images/2008/10/farcry2pc-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" class='pull-right' />\n\nOpen world game play is all the rage.

Huge thick trunked trees were whipping back and forth in such an unrealistic manner that it really detracted from the game..  Cap the winds guys..\n\n__Instant Respawn and drive times__ -- The game is massively open, and as such you have to drive from one point to another during missions.  It takes ages to get there and the vehicles drive like shit.  They very much feel like a cardboard box, not a real vehicle.  But fine, that can be forgiven.  More over, I'm okay with the openess of the game, but to keep things interesting they have placed ambush points in the form of guardposts on every fricken road between any two points.   In order to get to your mission you'll likely have to drive through 5 or 6 of them and it's a full on fight every time.   Which again, fine.    But they respawn to full strength pretty much instantly.    Why?!   Combine that with the fact that they are uber, nothing is destructable, they see you and open fire instantly..etc..  you get the point.\n\nFrankly it's just rediculous that they respawn so quickly, it's tedious and irritiating and servies no purpose but to piss me off.  The placed it there to keep the game from getting boring.. well this only exacerbated the problem not fix it.\n\nAll in all, the game kinda sucks.  It's not fun.  It's flat, lifeless and plainly dull because you end up having to do the same bullshit over and over again with out any real story or ties to some kind of story line.  It has none of the immersion that UBI claims is there.\n\nIn the end, I'm sadly disappointed.  I'll likely keep playing it a bit just to make sure, then ditch it for good.\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2008-09-15-windows-xp-sp3-access-denied.md","url":"/windows-xp-sp3-access-denied/","relative_path":"_posts/2008-09-15-windows-xp-sp3-access-denied.md","id":"/windows-xp-sp3-access-denied","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Windows XP Sp.3 ... \"Access Denied!\"","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2008/09/software.png","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-09-15 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"windows-xp-sp3-access-denied","ext":".md"},"url":"/game-review-farcry-2/","relative_path":"_posts/2008-10-28-game-review-farcry-2.md","id":"/game-review-farcry-2","collection":"posts","excerpt":"Open world game play is all the rage.

The service pack installer runs under the user (admin) account and not under the SYSTEM account. Failure to update a registry key causes the Setup program to fail.\"\n\nWait..  You mean Administrator isn't root?  Why does the root login for my box not have root access?!  Who's the jackass that thought that was a good idea?! \n\nAnd Microsofts official stance is that you must edit your registry.. something that if you don't do 100% correctly, you're boned.  I swear they developers at Microsoft are the biggest bunch of asshats..  I'd love to hear why this is acceptable and how this got through QA.. Someone MUST know -- Please chime in..\n\nWhat's jacked up is on their website it actually says that this is for advanced users only and if you're not comfortable then here is our support link where you can pay us to help you.. (I'm paraphrasing.)\n\nThey give instructions on how to fix it, then below the instructions they say that they aren't responsible if these instructions don't work.  Awesome..  Gotta love good customer support on top of a huge snafu.\n\nTo save you the trouble, here are the steps to fix it;\n\n* <a href=\"http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756/\" target=\"_blank\">Backup your registry.</a>\n* <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=e8ba3e56-d8fe-4a91-93cf-ed6985e3927b&amp;displaylang=en\" target=\"_blank\">Download Microsofts Subinacl.</a>\n* <a href=\"/images/2008/09/reset.cmd\" target=\"_blank\">Download this file and double click it.</a>\n* <a href=\"http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322389/\" target=\"_blank\">Install Service Pack 3 from the FULL install.</a>\n\nIt works.  Step 1 is vital just in case, 2 is a microsoft tool that enables the script that is step three.  Step three is just what passes for a shell script, feel free to read it via notepad.  Also, step three takes about 10 minutes to run so go have a coke and a smile.\n\n I had actually been considering installing Vista just to test out DX10 on a different partition, now screw that.  Install Vista? Accept/Deny... Denied.\n\nGame developers please.. start releasing your games for Linux..  Let's make Microsoft shape up or get the hell out of the market..\n","previous":{"next":{"path":"_posts/2008-09-15-windows-xp-sp3-access-denied.md","url":"/windows-xp-sp3-access-denied/","relative_path":"_posts/2008-09-15-windows-xp-sp3-access-denied.md","id":"/windows-xp-sp3-access-denied","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Windows XP Sp.3 ... \"Access Denied!\"","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2008/09/software.png","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-09-15 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"windows-xp-sp3-access-denied","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2008-09-02-game-review-grid.md","output":null,"content":"<img class=\"pull-right\" title=\"gridbox\" src=\"/images/2008/09/gridbox.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"130\" height=\"159\" />\n\nSo, I have always liked racing games. Grand Turismo was always my favorite franchise on the PS2 because the game was absolutely beautiful and fun to play.  However, I hated always being tied to the PS2.  I am not a big fan of console games, but it seems that our stock of racing games for PC have been fairly lack-luster.\n\nNot any more!  <a href=\"http://www.codemasters.com/grid/\" target=\"_blank\">Codemaster's, GRID</a> is a fantastic game.. Codemasters yet again earns the faith I put in them for a high quality product.. (Operation Flashpoint 2 better rule!)\nw\nOnce you get past the fact that you buy and sell cars through \"eBay Motors\" the game is quite enjoyable.. (I can't blame them for product placement.. I assume by letting Ebay, Champion, Valvoline... etc... add product placement and branding they can make the game for a lot less... Sponsors baby.. sponsors! It's not overly out of place and for the most part you don't even notice it.. )\n\nThe cars seem to drive pretty realistically and the realistic crash damage is awesome and adds a dynamic element to  the game..\n\nThe cars all move exactly as you would expect them to.  They seem to have real \"weight\" when they move which I like.  So many other car simulations just don't get it.. Codemasters really captured the feel of how a vehicle show move..\n\nOne thing I really think is a nice touch is that you can setup the game to know your real name, and as such say it when they talk to you. They recorded probably a 100 common names, both male and female as well as a bunch of nick names.. You can choose one as your \"audio name\" and when the pit crew guy talks to you via the radio he says your name.. I know that's really minor, and easy to do.. but its a nice touch and goes a long way towards immersion..\n\nSomething else I like is that it has a braking idiot light... The designers realized that they are simulating a very realistic sport, in an unrealistic medium and as such we as drivers have a hell of a lot of sensory information left completely out.. So knowing the proper time to brake for a sharp turn is often very hard to judge.. As such there is a little light in the lower left that will go green, yellow, red.. flash.. brake now you moron!!... etc.. I like that, but it needs to be right in the center of the screen.. Usually when amid 11 other cars all trying to get position and avoid crashing, its hard to notice..\n\nThe game does have an EXCELLENT multiplayer game..  Nothing more fun that doing race after race with other folks over the web.  The only real issue is that most people like running derby after derby and that gets told to me.. Also online game play being what it is, you do get quite a lot of douche bags who don't know how to do anything other than type \"fuck\" or \"nigger\" over and over again.. *sigh*  But so long as you can tune them out, its pretty fun.\n\nAt this point my only real complaint is that you MUST have a wheel.. trying to play this game with the keys (no mouse driving at all) is impossible or at least very hard with any accuracy.. (which makes sense.. I mean there is a good reason we drive with big analog wheels and not digital keys..)  So, having said that it's a completely invalid complaint but one that I figured I would voice.  I mean its a driving game after all, a wheel isn't out of the ordinary in the extremely rare situation of being in control of a car..\n\nWhen trying to drive with the keyboard the wheels, brakes and accelerator are either FULL ON, FULL OFF, FULL LEFT, or FULL RIGHT which makes for sporadic driving at best.\n\nI have 2 good wheels for my Playstation 2 but they don't use USB plugs so now I have to go buy a new wheel.. A little annoyed by that, but so be it.. I like racing games that much so I went out and got the R660 GT Motorsport racing wheel which I'll try to write a review about..  Some folks on the community grid forums can't get it to work with the game at all, but I'm having no troubles..\n\nWish list wise; I wish the game would actually make you pay for the damage you do to your car.. right now you can buy a 10 million dollar vehicle, total it.. and fixing it is free.. It shouldn't be.. but what can ya do.. this is really minor all things considered..\n\nThe reason this is important is because otherwise you can play the game as one bug crash derby and get away with it..\n\nI also wish you had more control over things like tire selection, engine tunings..etc.. That stuff is completely left out of the game.\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2008-08-12-knowledge-when-to-use-semicolon.md","url":"/knowledge-when-to-use-semicolon/","relative_path":"_posts/2008-08-12-knowledge-when-to-use-semicolon.md","id":"/knowledge-when-to-use-semicolon","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Knowledge: When to use semicolon.","layout":"post","tags":["Educational"],"image":"/images/2009/08/124211417018024.jpg","ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x2","private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-08-12 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"knowledge-when-to-use-semicolon","ext":".md"},"url":"/game-review-grid/","relative_path":"_posts/2008-09-02-game-review-grid.md","id":"/game-review-grid","collection":"posts","excerpt":"So, I have always liked racing games.
