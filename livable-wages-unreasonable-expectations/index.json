I have been really enjoying it and can easily see myself doing a lot of flying.  It's an amazing sense of freedom and awesome way to travel.\n\n#### Sense of freedom\nThe sense of freedom is the hardest thing to explain to people who simply don't get it -- but think of it this way;\n\nWhen you were a little kid you likely weren't allowed to leave the immediate area of your house or not go farther than the drive way.\n\nWhen you got old enough, you got your first little trike or big-wheel and your range suddenly became exponentially larger!  You could go all the way to the end of the block!\n\nWhen you got older still and you got your first bicycle, suddenly you could go to your friends house or the local community pool or something..  Another exponential jump.\n\nWhen you got to 16 or so, you got your first car!  Suddenly your sense of freedom just expanded another exponential jump and you could drive long distances, though you likely didn't.\n\nAs a grown adult, you know you can drive anywhere you want but most never do just due to the time involved.\n\nMost people never experience the next level of exponential freedom, flying their own aircraft.\n\nI'm so very ready for that next level of freedom!  More over, I have found that once you start flying you very quickly start dreaming about owning your own aircraft that can take you all the places you want to go and/or perform \"the mission.\"\n\n#### Defining the mission was key \nthe wife and I sat down and discussed _(read: she told me)_ what the mission should be;\n   \n   1.  I had to have a plane that could take me back and forth to Texas from north Georgia.  (~800nm)\n   2.  I wanted to be able to make this trip in less than 6 hours.\n   3.  I wanted a plane that could take myself, my wife, two small dogs and some light luggage.\n   4.  I need to be comfortable sitting in it.\n   5.  I had to actually be able to afford said aircraft.\n   6.  And finally, I'm going to be a low time pilot.  I need a plane that wont kill me.\n   \n#### Long distance\nMy mission was to be able to fly back and forth to Texas from my home in north Georgia -- not a small mission to be sure.  My company, her family, a lot of my friends..etc. are all in Texas.  We aren't.  Getting back and forth right now means a ticket on Delta.  Feh.  \n  \n#### I wanted to be able to make this trip in a reasonable amount of time; \nIt takes me 16 hours to drive to Texas from my home in the mountains of north Georgia.  Well that's just too long.\n\nUnfortunately, we are so far away from a major airport it takes me anywhere between 10 and 12 hours to fly commercially there on Delta. (3 hour drive to Atlanta. At least an hour and a half to get in to the airport from the parking lot, get checked in, wait in line for mandatory fondle by the TSA, and get to the terminal, hourish to wait for plane, to board plane to wait for push back..  3 hour flight.. 30min to an hour to get to get off the plane, get to the baggage area, get bags, get to rental counter, get car..etc..  This all assumes it's a straight flight, it's usually not.)  The longest I have had it take was 14 hours, the absolute shortest was just over 6.\n\nThe average amount of time seemed to pan out at around 10.  I wanted to make that flight in under 6.\n\n#### A four place plane for wife and \"kids\"\nThe majority of the time, it will likely be just me flying in the plane.  But my wife made the point that if I'm going to get an aircraft, an expensive luxury item, I should get one that will do all the things.  And one of those things was for us to be able to travel around the country as a couple.  And that means, bringing the \"kids.\"  The kids in this case are our two little dogs.  That with some light luggage.\n\n#### Comfort!\nI'm both tall, and wide.  I need a plane I can sit in comfortably and to be completely honest, most aircraft I have been in are absolutely not comfortable at all.  My flight instructors Cessna 172 is a workhorse, and will get ya from point A to point B (slowly) but not in anything remotely approaching comfort.  It's just too narrow.  I have broad shoulders and I really don't like being jammed up against that door, or my flight instructor.\n\nI want a plane that can seat me and someone next to me without being physically pressed into the left door.\n\n#### Price\nYeah, this one was tough.  I have pondered it quite a bit and struggled with how to afford said aircraft.\n \nThe more I looked the more I realized that this aircraft would have to be extremely beefy and large.  That mean, expensive.  Usually, very expensive. I needed to have an aircraft I could actually afford to own and fly.\n\n#### Experience\nSince I'm still a student pilot as of my writing this, I needed a plane that would be some what docile in the air and not be scary to my wife (or me).\n\n#### Competitors\n\nI looked at all manner of aircraft;\n\n* Cessna High Wings \n  - 150 - Scootie puff jr. of the sky.  No thanks.\n  - 152 - Way too small, and again slow.\n  - 172 - Small, not comfortable, slow\n  - 177 - Nice, but slow and with retracts insurance would likely be a problem for a low time pilot like me\n  - 182 - Bigger, better, still kinda slow though with a higher fuel consumption\n  \n* Cessna Low Wings\n  - Corvalis - VERY nice, way too much plane for me.  Too expensive new or used.  This one would perform the mission perfectly.\n  \n* Cirrus\n  - SR20 - Very nice aircraft but too expensive new, and even a used one will set you back a fair amount.\n  - SR22 - VERY nice, probably too much plane for me.  Again too expensive new or used.  This would do the trick though.\n\n* Pipers \n  - All of the pipers I sat in were older and too cramped in side.\n  - The larger newer pipers are too expensive\n  \nI can go on..  Most of the planes had something that just didn't work one way or another.  Too small.. Too slow.. Too old.. Too expensive to purchase or maintain..etc.\n\n#### Enter kit planes\nAt some point during this process I came to the realization that buying an aircraft that could meet my #1 and #2 requirements (which were the most important ones to me) meant way too much money.    \n\nThat's when I started looking hard at home built aircraft and found the Velocity aircraft.  What a sexy machine.  I know nothing about fiberglass though and the more I looked at the Velocity line of aircraft there were things about them I didn't care for either.  \n\nI decided to look elsewhere.. \n\n#### Van's Aircraft\nEventually I landed on the Van's Aircraft page and started looking hard at one of their kit planes.\n\nAt this point, I had decided to eschew the 4 place requirement entirely since the costs of all these airplanes were pretty high and build time was a factor.  Focusing on the other 5 requirements, I decided on either the -9 or the new -14.\n \nEnter my wife. \n\nShe plead her case and basically told me that if I'm going to do this.. do it right! \n\nHer exact words were something to the effect of;  _\"If you're going to spend a lot of money, buy what will do everything we want.\"_\n  \n#### That's my girl!  \n\nThe -10 was the obvious choice.\n\n1.  It can easily make the 800nm trip in a single bound.  Really your only limit is your bladder.\n2.  It can make the trip in about 5 hours.\n3.  It can easily hold myself, my wife, the two dogs and luggage.\n4.  I have sat in two of them now, both very comfortable.\n5.  I can totally afford one.\n6.  Everyone I know that has flown one says they are a dream to fly.\n\nSo there ya go!  Decision made!  Then after a month of yammering away about to my wife she made me shut up and buy the first piece. \n\nThis is going to be an epic journey to say the least.  \n\nThese pages document the entire process, and my intent is to also provide youtube documentary style instructional videos for others to view and maybe learn something from.  Or if nothing else to document the process.\n\nThanks\n","collection":"posts","url":"/a-new-beginning/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2015-02-07-modifying-jekyll.md","collection":"posts","url":"/modifying-jekyll/","path":"_posts/2015-02-07-modifying-jekyll.md","id":"/modifying-jekyll","draft":false,"categories":["Software Development"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Modifying Jekyll to track my RV-10 Build Log!

It's one of those things that I truly enjoy and get a real sense of accomplish out of when I can make something work the way I want it to.\n\nI switched to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) as my primary blogging system a [while back](http://randomstringofwords.com/blogging-like-its-1999/) and haven't looked back.  It's been great.  Just like my early post says; Blogging like it's 1999!  Each page is built as raw html and then pushed to the servers.  Fast, secure, easy.  \n   \nBut I wanted to add a special post type \"build-log\" to my blog so that I could write all about my RV-10 build experience and have it track just like any other blog, but in a different directory structure.  This would be basically a blog, within a blog.  \n\nI started writing said plugin and it got pretty massive.  I was basically having to re-architecture/re-factor all of Jekyll to make it happen and that was just not going to fly.  It wouldn't be performant, it would have to be forward/backwards compatible and in the long run maintaining it would suck.\n\nSO I cheated.\n\nI simply deleted the plugin ( and the probably hundred hours I put into making it ) and started a new Jekyll blog for the build log, using all the same views as the main blog.  \n\nI then had the build log blog output to a directory structure nested within the main blog.  This forced me to go in and move all the files down one directory once it was build but I have a script now that will do it all for me!    Ding!  I get two complete blogs within one another that are stored in different repo's and build into a single blog.  Easy!\n\nJekyll.. I'm still a huge fan.\n\nAlso, with this new addition to the site I have implemented [Disqus](http://disqus.com) comments instead of the old facebook comments which were a pain and not very good.","collection":"posts","url":"/modifying-jekyll/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2015-02-07-modifying-jekyll.md","collection":"posts","url":"/modifying-jekyll/","path":"_posts/2015-02-07-modifying-jekyll.md","id":"/modifying-jekyll","draft":false,"categories":["Software Development"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Modifying Jekyll to track my RV-10 Build Log!

It requires a lot of time, effort and energy on my part to stay current and competitive in my industry so I have very little patience with people who think I get paid too much money for what I do. \n\nSorry, but anyone who says software engineers and architects get paid too much, don’t understand what it takes to do what we do.\n\nI think the issue is most people just see the initial number and think it’s a lot.   On the surface, $10k is a lot of money.  And if I were given $10k for doing nothing then I’d be happy as a clam.\n\nMost people have no concept the amount of work, time, and effort that goes into writing software and as such they can’t really fathom it.  Because they can’t wrap their mind around it and because there is nothing physical to put value to, it’s very easy to think that they are paying us that $10k for nothing and that we should be just happy as a clam for being offered it.\n\nIt pains me to have to be the one to explain to them that this isn’t the case.  The problem comes when you have those people that are actually offended by the amount I say it would actually require in order to pull their dream off.   I’m usually looked at as a greedy bastard and thought of as a criminal.\n\nMost firms would charge closer to $100k for that 3 month job.  See what I mean?  You scoffed a little didn’t you.\n\nAnd I’m just talking about the initial development cost.  Not maintenance fees, server hardware, data storage fees, design costs, testing costs etc..  \n\nThe problem with going with the $10k firm versus the $100k firm is that you get what you pay for.  The perceived value is in dollars only, without any thought or consideration to the quality of the work being done or the support you’re going to get before start, during development and after completion. \n\nThey have already approached $10k firm for the product and they don’t like the support / communication they were getting (read: the firm has just disappeared because 10k for this project is too low), so why are they looking for another $10k firm that will likely give them the exact same results?  \n\nYou get what you pay for and people some how refuse to learn that lesson with software.  \n\n","collection":"posts","url":"/livable-wages-unreasonable-expectations/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2016-02-29-democratic-socialism.md","collection":"posts","url":"/democratic-socialism/","path":"_posts/2016-02-29-democratic-socialism.md","id":"/democratic-socialism","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Democratic Socialism","layout":"post","tags":["Democratic Socialism"],"image":"/images/2016/socialism.png","gallery":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"tile_class":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"duration":null,"costs":null,"date":"2016-02-29 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"democratic-socialism","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2015-08-18-livable-wages-unreasonable-expectations.md","excerpt":"I work in an industry that demands highly skilled laborers but are constantly bombarded by accusations of greed or people that scoff as the costs.

They color it by saying it's \"Democratic Socialism\" (\"DS\" going forward) which is sorta the same thing and not good -- Bear with me here.  \n\nTrue democratic socialists believe that a socialist state can be achieved through democratic means.  I don't believe that's what these folks are going for.  It would be far better for these people to refer to themselves as Social Democrats because then at least that says they aim to modify the harshness of capitalism with the infusion of some elements of socialism which I believe to be closer to their true aim.   But so far all of the millennials I have talked to that are pro the \"DS\" idea's call themselves democratic socialists, not social democrats.  May seem like a minor quibble all things considered but language matters.\n\n## To those people I'd like to say the following;   \n\nFirstly, and foremost; I appreciate that you have a political view.  That’s a good thing.  I know a lot of people my age, who at your age had no political views what-so-ever and happily let the government do whatever it wanted.  You're not doing that.  Good for you!  Take a stand in what you believe in.. Hell yeah.. that’s what America is all about!  I very much appreciate your attempts to better the country where my generation was a little less caring about it. \n\nHaving said that, in my opinion, there is a distinct dichotomy between being for \"DS\" but against the government doing something it feels is in your best interest. I'm specifically referring to the FBI wanting to add backdoors to iphones \"for your own good\".  It's good they oppose that, but it seems to be a direct contradiction to the \"DS\" mentality -- but that's an aside.\n\n## \"Democracy is the road to Socialism\"&#185;\n\nI'd also like to point out that the United States of America isn't a democracy.  We live in a constitutional republic, and while the line between democracy and republic is a fine one -- it's an important one.  Primarily because a constitutional republic is the road to freedom, and a democracy is the road to socialism.  \n\nSo with that, I have some serious concerns with “Democratic Socialism”.  Mostly that by its very nature it imbues the government with MORE power.  It strikes me as away by the citizens to eschew responsibility to the government and basically implies that you trust the government to take care of your needs.   History is replete with examples of why this is a bad idea.\n\n## \"The road to Hell is paved with good intentions\"&#178;\n\nDemocratic Socialism is a white wash of socialism.  Most non-democratic societies love to throw the word “democratic” into the language to describe what they are doing just to muddy the water, to confused and befuddle the proletariat into thinking that they had some choice or input on the matter.  They often don't.   I mean what exactly is democratic about the DPRK?  \n    \n## \"Men make their own history, but they do not make it as they please\"&#179;\n    \nAs to the United States; it really seems like people have forgotten that the US government has a primary job of national defense.   Giving the government more and more power, which is what democratic socialists are trying to do, will only encourage the tyrannical shift that many governments in the past have made.  History doomed to repeat itself.  \n\n<hr />\n\n<img src='/images/2016/dangers-socialism.png' class='left' />\n### Dangers of Socialism\n\n\"DS\" or just Socialism in general has a lot of dangers to it;\n  \n#### It rewards people for being irresponsible, indolent and for being unaccountable for their own actions\n\nIn an environment where you aren't responsible to produce, what stops you from being a complete lazy slob that can just hold your hand out and demand compensation?  Nothing.  In this environment people will demand more and more for doing less and less.  We already see this today and it will only get worse. \n\nThis system actively rewards people for being indolent and promotes indolence by de-incentivizing, robbing of initiative, drive and ambition those that produce anything because they have the fruits of their labor effectively stolen from them to perpetuate those that don’t.  \"DS\" not only allows for and legalizes theft but actively promotes it in the name of redistributing wealth.\n\n\n#### It de-incentivizes those that do produce, robbing them of not only the fruits of their labor but the initiative to produce in the first place\n\nThose that do produce things will be less and less likely to do so over time because they will see the individual who did nothing rewarded for doing nothing with the very fruits the producer should have gotten.  The notion that people will continue to produce happily for the sake of production is a flawed one due to the nature of Humans.  The Mark 1.0 Human being simply doesn't work that way.\n\n\n#### It rationalizes theft, penalizes accomplishment and does away with individual rights for the sake of the \"public good\"\n\nIf you're taking away from the person who produced in order to give it to the person who didn't, then you're not only penalizing the producer and de-incentivizing that production, but you're stealing from that individual who produced to give to those that didn't.   You can't encourage people to do more by first stealing from them.  You can't multiply production by first dividing it.  And you can't encourage those who do nothing to start being a productive member of society if you are giving them hand outs.  Again, Human nature.\n\nThis means that it completely undermines any spirit of entrepreneurship, innovation and competitiveness and actively promotes totalitarianism by encouraging people to be self-indulgent instead of self reliant.\n   \nThis also means that the rights of the worker will go out the window in favor of the public good and control by the state.\n\n#### It actively promotes obedience to the state, idealizes state power and encourages dependence on the state\n\nThis is where the real issue is;  The more the government squeezes and takes with intent to distribute to those who don't have, the more people will become dependant on that handout.   The more we go down the \"DS\" hole, the deeper people will get and the more people will rely on the government.  It’s a vicious cycle.  Think of where that will end..  By it’s very nature it can’t stop with just social programs like people think.  \n\nThe “democratic” aspect of it means people are willingly giving their own freedoms up without fully exploring where this could go.\n\n\n### But the Scandinavian democratic socialists managed it!\n\nmmmm, no they didn't.  \n\n_“I know that some people in the US associate the Nordic model with some sort of socialism. Therefore I would like to make one thing clear. Denmark is far from a socialist planned economy. Denmark is a market economy.”_  -- Prime Minister of Denmark at a speech at the Harvard Institute of Politics.\n\nCountries that already do this are pure consumer economies some with over 50% unemployment and over 80% taxation.\n\n## To sum up with Pro's and Con's\n\nWhat would it mean for a true socialist democratic solution in the US?\n\n## Con's:\n - Taxes would go up - A lot to cover all the new spending\n - Unemployment would go up - A lot because people don't have to work\n - Productivity would go down - A lot because people will be de-incentivized\n - People would be reliant on the government\n - Gives government much more (if not full) control\n - Rights of workers go out the window\n \n## Pro's:\n - Income inequality would go down - Unfair to those who product\n - Free benefits would go up - Not really free at all due to high taxes\n - Promotes a classless society - Rich and Poor gap will narrow drastically, again unfair to those who produced and earned\n\n&#185;,&#178;,&#179; : Finally, if you agree with any of the quoted headers above then you agree with Carl Marx and his Communist Manifesto as they are direct quotes from the man -- this would be a good time to rethink your position.  National Socialism (Hitler), Marxist Socialism (Communism), and Democratic Socialism are different, but not vastly so.  More over \"DS\" can include forms of Marxism and even Anarchism.  I feel modern pro \"DS\" individuals are taking more of a Marxist tack than they realize.\n\nAlso, keep in mind, governments ultimately enforce everything with a gun.  I feel that this socialism road people are trying to take us down will have a very bad ending...\n\n<hr/>\n\nAdditional -- I think this is a pretty good viewing and worth watching all of it: \n\n<iframe width=\"920\" height=\"540\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/D0Yp1jUtcX8\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","collection":"posts","url":"/democratic-socialism/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2016-02-29-democratic-socialism.md","collection":"posts","url":"/democratic-socialism/","path":"_posts/2016-02-29-democratic-socialism.md","id":"/democratic-socialism","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Democratic Socialism","layout":"post","tags":["Democratic Socialism"],"image":"/images/2016/socialism.png","gallery":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"tile_class":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"duration":null,"costs":null,"date":"2016-02-29 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"democratic-socialism","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2016-12-01-out-of-time.md","content":"Well, it's that time again.  Time for me to talk about how I never post any more and how I have no time.  Life is super busy, I'm doing too many things, I need to find time..etc.. \n\nFeh.. These are all lies.  Mostly, I think I'm just really wanting to do something else..  I get into these weird moods where nothing is right and everything looks old/boring..etc.  Really this is just an excuse and a sign that something larger is at issue.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm still going to ponder redoing this site.. 'cause that's the kind of brain damaged I am but a lot more is going on.  \n\nA couple months ago I sold off my half of my ownership in a software company and honestly, it was past time.   In a weird way I'm still coming to terms with it, but mostly because I still don't know what I want to be when I grow up. \n\nWhen you have worked in software for over twenty years, it's hard to do something else.   A clean break seems impossible, but at the same time seems like the only way to move forward.  \n\nGrok was great and it was a good experience over all but I want to do my own thing, and I want to do other things.   I got into software professionally in the early 1990's and almost did it on a lark.  Originally programming was a hobby that was all funzies and joy..  The important lesson I learned was, once you turn a hobby into a career, you lose the hobby and it becomes work.\n\nI'm to the point now that the notion of going back into software as a professional developer (even as an individual contributor instead of management) is completely distasteful.  Sure the money is great, but the level of anxiety and sense of misery is palpable.  I just can't bring myself to do it. \n\nI still like the idea of writing my own software and doing something very passively that might make money or might not just as an \"out\" or as something fun to do in my spare time though.  Very much back to my original \"hobby\" status with programming.  But professionally?  Nope.  I think I'm done there.\n\nI've pondered doing some stuff with the airplane build that makes it more of a tutorial site where others can comment and give input on how to build a plane.  Sort of a community documentation site.  I have to ponder this.  But the idea would be to make it so that each step in the plans would be it's own page with a video or documentation on how to do the work.  Almost an interactive crowd sourced project where people can talk / discuss and even comment directly on the plans and steps in a virtual space.   I have reached out to Scott Risan at Van's Aircraft to see if this is something they would support or veto.  No response yet. \n\nI'm going to make a video to my patreons about this and see what they think.\n\n### Other things on my list of \"shit to do\";\n\n_I want to redesign the blog_ \nBut not necessarily a full visual redesign, but more of a \"bring it up to currency\" with regards to be backend deployment software.  It's been ages since I have updated my Jekyll install and I'm STILL using LESS.  That needs to be rectified.  \n\n","collection":"posts","url":"/out-of-time/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2017-05-15-developer-burnout.md","collection":"posts","url":"/developer-burnout/","path":"_posts/2017-05-15-developer-burnout.md","id":"/developer-burnout","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Software Developer Burnout...
