 I don't think so.. but they are so close!\n\nLets take Adobe Flash Professional as an example of whats going on, and their likely reasons behind it;  If you purchase the full version it costs $799 and the simple fact of the matter is, most individuals wont want to pay that kind of money for a piece of software.  So really the only purchasers of their code were companies that could easily absorb that cost (or the rare individual like myself that is willing to pay).   At $799 even \"honest joe\" will pirate the software if he really wants it.\n\nAt that price point they have completely alienated the casual user.   More over that price point only serves to encourage the casual user to pirate the software because its not even remotely affordable.  I'm not saying its right to pirate by any stretch, but I am saying that even an honest person can rationalize doing so when the price point is so far out of their reach.   Many would say eight hundred or eight million, it makes no matter so screw it.\n\nMore over, most software companies look at each pirated copy of their software as lost revenue, thus as a general rule they resort to raising the price even higher so that the companies that do make the purchase help to recoup costs and offset the fact that the software is pirated so much.. causing a vicious cycle.  <a href=\"/ubisoft-and-their-drm/\">Ubisoft is very guilty of this</a>..\n\nSo the question becomes, how do you get the casual user?   What is the price point most people are willing to throw at a piece of software?  And in the subscription model;  How much are people willing to spend monthly on something?\n\nLowering the cost of the software to something the casual user would be able to afford simply isn't the answer because then suddenly they lose all the money they were getting when companies were purchasing the software.  So even though it sure would be nice to get Adobe Flash Professional for $50.. it wont happen..heh\n\nSo the subscription model really does seem like a good option as it allows those who have the money to purchase the full software to do so, and those who want to try the software out or to keep an active subscription to do so without breaking the bank.\n\nBut here is where they are missing a huge opportunity that most MMO game creators have already figured out..  Something I like to refer to as the 10% rule or the 90/10 rule (maybe related to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle\" target=\"_blank\">Pareto Principle</a>?).\n\nAnd that is simply, if you set the monthly subscription rate at the correct price point a vast majority of people wont bother to ever cancel it because it's beneath their notice.    According to my sources inside, Blizzard has about 10% of their accounts that remain open and paid for, but they are never played simply because the monthly fee is low enough that it's below the radar of the consumer.\n\nI really do think that the subscription model is the future of software publishing and purchasing, but I really believe Adobe has missed the mark a tad by setting the price point too high.\n\nIn my humble opinion Adobe is a few dollars away from a goldmine..  If they were to set the price point for their new subscription model to $15 with a year contract or $25 (at most!) without, most people would never bother to cancel the subscription.   Then maybe they could also offer a $35 rent to own model or even a variable \"choose your own rate\" rent to own model as I'm sure there are folks who'd want that too..   But the current $49 month to month is just too high as the first month they don't use it, they'll notice and cancel it.\n\nEven so I salute you Adobe for bringing your awesome software to the casual users again.. Thanks for that.   Now if you don't mind I'm gonna go buy Flash Professional.\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2011-07-23-mandolin-luthiery.md","url":"/mandolin-luthiery/","relative_path":"_posts/2011-07-23-mandolin-luthiery.md","id":"/mandolin-luthiery","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Hobbies"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Mandolin Luthiery -- Making and playing the Mandolin","layout":"post","tags":["Luthiery","Mandolin","Wood Working"],"image":"/images/2011/07/mandolin101.jpg","ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x2","private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2011-07-23 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"mandolin-luthiery","ext":".md"},"url":"/adobe-software-subscriptions-missed-it-by-that-much/","relative_path":"_posts/2011-08-11-adobe-software-subscriptions-missed-it-by-that-much.md","id":"/adobe-software-subscriptions-missed-it-by-that-much","collection":"posts","excerpt":"Recently Adobe announced that they would be offering their software at rental subscription prices and I was excited!

  It's a good purchase and I can highly recommend it..\n\nRoger offers a really nice kit that seems to go with his book, but it costs over $500 and I just didn't think that would be a good beginners project.  So I settled on getting an inexpensive <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?um=1&amp;hl=en&amp;rlz=1C1CHFX_enUS431US431&amp;biw=1459&amp;bih=939&amp;q=Saga%20AM-10%20A-Model%20Mandolin%20Kit&amp;gs_sm=e&amp;gs_upl=9714l9714l0l10062l1l1l0l0l0l0l78l78l1l1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;tbo=u&amp;tbm=shop&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=if\" target=\"_blank\">Saga AM10 Mandolin Kit</a> to experiment on which I got off ebay for less than $90..\n\n<a href=\"/images/2011/07/mandolin0011.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Mandolin in Fixture\" src=\"/images/2011/07/mandolin0011-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Mandolin in Fixture\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Mandolin in Fixture</span></a>\n\nAs kit's go, I'd say this one is extremely rough, to the point of being bad, as very few of the parts matched up, even a little..  The instructions that came with it were meager at best, and very poor in most cases..  The strings it came with are worthless (the e string broke trying to bring it up to tension, I didn't even get it close to tuned and it popped)..  The back didn't fit the body at all, being undersized compared to the top and required a heck of a lot of work.. The neck didn't fit the main body at all, again a lot of work..etc..\n\n<a href=\"/images/2011/07/mandolin0021.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"Bottomless Mandolin\" src=\"/images/2011/07/mandolin0021-e1311459220144-150x112.jpg\" alt=\"Bottomless Mandolin\" width=\"150\" height=\"112\" /><br /><span>Bottomless Mandolin</span></a>\n\nI think a beginner woodworker would have had a very difficult time with this kit to be honest.. I have a lot of tools, experience and time with wood so it wasn't too bad for me but even so I had to make a bunch of jigs and fixtures in order to get things to line up and work correctly.   But even with my best effort just due to how it was cut my neck isn't correctly centered on the soundboard which will make stringing it interesting..   The tail piece is half an inch off center unfortunately which means the bridge is off center..etc..  I have no idea how that is going to affect the sound of the instrument but in all likelihood it won't do it justice.\n\nAll things considered though, I'm actually happy with my results so far..  It's taken me just shy of 3 weeks to get it all worked up and to the point of getting strings on it.  (Mostly working on the weekends and an hour or two in the evenings during the week when I could..\n\n<a href=\"/images/2011/07/mandolin003.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"One string Mandolin\" src=\"/images/2011/07/mandolin003-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"One string Mandolin\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>One string Mandolin</span></a>\n\nToday I added the very first string to the instrument and tuned it up just to see what it sounded like..  Shockingly it sounded like a D!  The instrument didn't have any kind of odd barks or vibrations though it does sound slightly different than the Ibanez I purchased above.\n\nI have added 4 other strings to it at this point and the difference in the sound is still there, but I simply am not articulate enough with sound and instrument theory to describe to you the difference.. it's just slightly different.. Not better, not worse.. different.\n\nEven so, I'm pretty happy so far with how things are going.\n\n","previous":{"next":{"path":"_posts/2011-07-23-mandolin-luthiery.md","url":"/mandolin-luthiery/","relative_path":"_posts/2011-07-23-mandolin-luthiery.md","id":"/mandolin-luthiery","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Hobbies"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Mandolin Luthiery -- Making and playing the Mandolin","layout":"post","tags":["Luthiery","Mandolin","Wood Working"],"image":"/images/2011/07/mandolin101.jpg","ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x2","private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2011-07-23 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"mandolin-luthiery","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2011-07-22-game-review-frozen-synapse.md","output":null,"content":"<a href=\"/images/2011/07/frozensynapse.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Frozen Synapse\" src=\"/images/2011/07/frozensynapse-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Frozen Synapse\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Frozen Synapse</span></a>\n\nI have always been a huge fan of the turn based tactical isometric games such as Jagged Alliance, JA2, Xcom..etc..  For whatever reason that style of meticulous gameplay always appealed to me, but I had always assumed I was alone in my passion because those games never seemed to last very long in favor of first person shooters or real time strategy games..etc..\n\nIn fact, the industry as a whole has completely moved away from turn based game play, which I find to be a shame. Well thank god there are awesome independent developers around to fill the void!\n\nFrozen Synapse is just the turn based top down tactical game that I have been craving for years.  It has a wonderfully fun and even somewhat dark sense of humor and most importantly, awesome gameplay.\n\nThere is nothing better than a game with deceptively simple gameplay that provides hours and hours of fun because it's extremely challenging to master..\n\nPlus it's multiplayer!!  How awesome is that?!\n\nI can't tell you the number of times I said that XCom needed to be multiplayer so that I could play against my friends..

This game is longer than some, and I realize that for every minute of gameplay it likely takes them months.. but still..  This game clocks in at about 10 hours.\n\nAnd it also suffers from another common issue with games these days;  Its too easy..   My theory as to why this happens lately is because most of the modern games are first made for consoles, and then ported to PC.. as such the controls on a PC are much easier to use, so the situations you're in are suddenly that much easier?  This is a wild guess, but it will likely seem logical to anyone who has tried (and failed horribly) to play a game on a console using those crap controllers..  I can see how any game would be difficult if you handicap someone with one of those damn things..\n\nMost games have at least 4 difficulty settings; Easy, Normal, Hard and Expert.. Or some myriad of names that equate to the same thing..  And in just about every game out there, I know that I should start playing it on \"Hard\" because anything easier would be pointless.   I can't imagine how simplistic and juvenile \"Easy\" must be on these games because \"Hard\" is anything but..  This game suffers badly in this area because even on \"Hard\" I didn't find it remotely challenging.  \"Hard\" should be difficult.  Make it a challenge so that I will want to play through again..\n\nI think its likely that game makers are afraid of making their games actually difficult because then people might get frustrated and stop playing.. However, I'm of the opinion that making a game like this too easy even when set on \"hard\" in order to keep the game \"fun\" is akin to handing the little league losers a trophy for participation..   Reward me for doing well, not for just showing up.  If I set the game to \"hard\" I believe it's reasonable to expect the game to actually be difficult.\n\nAnd finally my major complaint about the game is the weapons they give you.    Within the first minute or two of gameplay they give you the ONLY WEAPON YOU WILL EVER NEED; the gravity gun.   Now, I don't want to complain about the gravity gun.. there is nothing more fun that hurling a whole building of destructive debris at an enemy.. and you generally have a reasonable expectation of doing fairly well when you use the same gun to hurl an enemy at a far wall only to watch him <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gib_(video_gaming)\" target=\"_blank\">gib</a>.     But, why do I need the other guns?\n\nThey give you a whole slew of other wizbang cool guns and more ammo than you can shake a stick at just lying around but I can honestly say I didn't even start using ANY of them until near the very end of the game.  Up to that point I just used the gravity gun to do everything..   Either tossing the mobs around or throwing entire structures at them..  The other guns seemed pointless mostly.. and the ludicrous amounts of ammo lying around, doubly so.\n\nThis game is also extremely linear, so much so if you get out of the \"area\" you're supposed to be in a countdown to your doom will appear.. better boogy back to where you're supposed to be pronto..  I don't really want to hold this up as a complaint though, this isn't a sandbox game and like the original was never meant to be..   Still I can see how some might be put off by the count down thing..\n\nAll in all though I enjoyed the game.   There is still something very appealing about being about appease your darker side by waging wanton destruction on the carefully designed levels..  And if you're not giddily giggling like a school girl over being about to toss mobs around like rag dolls to their ultimate doom, then you don't know how to have a good time..  it was fun.  Though it's replayability is pretty much zero.\n\nI give this game 3.5 out of 5. (That's a good score from me.)\n","previous":{"next":{"path":"_posts/2011-07-15-game-review-red-faction-armageddon.md","url":"/game-review-red-faction-armageddon/","relative_path":"_posts/2011-07-15-game-review-red-faction-armageddon.md","id":"/game-review-red-faction-armageddon","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Game Review: Red Faction - Armageddon","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2011/07/red-faction-armageddon-review.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2011-07-15 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"game-review-red-faction-armageddon","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2011-06-20-hostgator-really-sucks.md","output":null,"content":"<img class=\"pull-right\" title=\"Hostgator Sucks\" src=\"/images/2011/06/hostgator_sucks.jpg\" alt=\"Hostgator Sucks\" width=\"198\" height=\"306\" />\n\nI have moved my hosting off Hostgator because frankly, they suck.   My site was suffering repeated down times, crashes, database disconnects, SSH daemon crashes/hangups, ..etc..\n\nThe big pisser for me though was the SSH restricted access that they had given me, combined with the more recent downtime..\n\nFor whatever reason I'd try to SSH into my account and it would fail acting as if there was no SSH daemon running..  I'd have to contact them via their live chat system, wait in queue forever for some support monkey to help me, only to have them either tell me that;  A) nothings wrong.  B) I don't have an account with them or best of all C) \"Oh yeah we changed the SSH port to ### now.. use that.. \"\n\nSeriously?  You just up and changed the SSH port?  Why?!  It's been 22 for ever.. Now suddenly its 2222? ... WHY?!\n\nApparently their support team is filled with more assholes than a donkey in an iron maiden..\n\nOkay that probably wasn't fair, but it was funny =)..  But I mean seriously, If I can't SSH/SCP into my box then there is a serious issue here..  They also have it setup apparently so that you can't have more than 2 SSH connections at a time, and each time you SCP a file to/from the box it creates a new connection, thus that's the reason for the failure of the third connection attempt and the reason you have to wait for 3 minutes for those connections to time out.  (Or so their tech support drone said.. )  What a crock of shit..\n\nAnd when I did finally manage to SSH in they had me stuck in a jail shell so I can't do dick anyway.. I just wanted to use screen people.. that's all!!\n\nIt wasn't so bad 2 years ago when I first got the account, but it's been getting worse and recently my site was down for nearly 48 hours.. Done.. Stick a fork in me..\n\nI'm kicking them to the curb..  Their shit stinks and if they continue they are going to be hurting for business..\n\n__EDIT__:  Okay so I did talk to them at length over the phone about the service I was getting and they didn't make a lot of excuses or try to be shady about it, but rather owned up to the issues and apologized.    While I am unhappy with their service, I am impressed at how they handled the whole thing..  They were very professional and courteous..   So with that I'm still moving on, but I am willing to give them the benefit of the doubt and say that they are still a good company, if maybe just not the right ones for me.*\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2011-05-22-su-152-tank-destroyer.md","url":"/su-152-tank-destroyer/","relative_path":"_posts/2011-05-22-su-152-tank-destroyer.md","id":"/su-152-tank-destroyer","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Hobbies"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"SU-152 Tank Destroyer","layout":"post","tags":["3D Graphics","Tank"],"image":"/images/2011/05/SU152-hour17-18.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2011-05-22 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"su-152-tank-destroyer","ext":".md"},"url":"/hostgator-really-sucks/","relative_path":"_posts/2011-06-20-hostgator-really-sucks.md","id":"/hostgator-really-sucks","collection":"posts","excerpt":"I have moved my hosting off Hostgator because frankly, they suck.   My site was suffering repeated down times, crashes, database disconnects, SSH daemon crashes/hangups, ..etc..","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Hostgator Really Sucks...","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2011/06/hostgator_sucks.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2011-06-20 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"hostgator-really-sucks","ext":".md"},"url":"/game-review-red-faction-armageddon/","relative_path":"_posts/2011-07-15-game-review-red-faction-armageddon.md","id":"/game-review-red-faction-armageddon","collection":"posts","excerpt":"I played Red Faction back in 2001 when it first came out and enjoyed the heck out of it.   It was the very first game to come out with the Geo-Mod game engine which allowed for massive destruction of the game models and levels.  ","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Game Review: Red Faction - Armageddon","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2011/07/red-faction-armageddon-review.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2011-07-15 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"game-review-red-faction-armageddon","ext":".md"},"url":"/game-review-frozen-synapse/","relative_path":"_posts/2011-07-22-game-review-frozen-synapse.md","id":"/game-review-frozen-synapse","collection":"posts","excerpt":"I have always been a huge fan of the turn based tactical isometric games such as Jagged Alliance, JA2, Xcom..etc..  So this new one excited me!","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Game Review: Frozen Synapse","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2011/07/frozensynapse.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2011-07-22 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"game-review-frozen-synapse","ext":".md"}
