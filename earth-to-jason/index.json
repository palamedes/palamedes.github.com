Thanks for calling.. *click*\"\n\nI immediately called them back and told the new operator (that I got after navigating their automated system.. again) that I wanted to cancel my account and that it was due to their recent rate hike.. I have zero intention of paying 30% and that's ludicrous..   He said, \"but wait.. what if we lowered your APR would that make you stay?\"\n\nI explained that the previous operator told me there was no way to lower my rate.. So I want to cancel the account.. (2)..  He came back explaining that he could lower my rate to 26% for 6 months.. (after which it would spring back to 30%)..  I said that this was a bunch of crap, that if this was such a deal why didn't the last guy offer it and that 26% is still robbery..  No thank you, I'd like to cancel my account.. (3)..\n\n\"But wouldn't you like to lower your rate?\" ..   I explained that if he could lower my rate to 0% I'd stick around, otherwise, I'd like to cancel my account.. (4)..  \"No you want to lower your rate, so that the remaining balance doesn't take that 30% rate, but instead gets this much lower rate... \"  (26% is \"much lower\")..  I told him that I just paid the account off, online.. that there is no remaining balance and that I'd like to cancel my account.. (5)..\n\nBut.. blah blah.. and blahdiddy blah..   I'd like to cancel my account.. (6).. if you keep pestering me to lower my rate I will ask to speak to your manager..\n\n\"Id be more than happy to let you speak to my manager..  but golly we need to lower this rate.. blah blah bullshit bullshit I'm a douche blah blah blah\"..   I'd like to cancel my fucking account please.. (7).. and now I want to speak to your manager..\n\nI honestly was getting really pissed.. this asshat wouldn't let me just cancel the damn account..  I don't want it any more.. you're trying to screw me, and I refuse to do business with you..  Take your \"amazing low rate of 26%\" and shove it up your ass..  cancel my account.. I shouldn't have to ask for this 7+ times.. (I'm sure it was more than 7.. this is very much the short version.. )\n\nEventually he asks me to hold (I fully expected him to just hang up the phone..)  A minute or so later someone got on the line claiming to be his manager and I told him that I wanted to cancel the account and that I shouldn't have to ask so many times, and that I shouldn't be pressured to do something I don't want to do.. I want to cancel the account.. Period.. I'm done working with you..\n\nHe said, \"Fine it's canceled, do you want confirmation of the cancelation?\"  -- \"You're damn skippy.. \"  --  \"It will be sent to your billing address.. *click*\"\n\nThe manager was rude as hell..  I should never have had to deal with him.. The initial call taker should be fired to be honest.. Or retrained at best..\n\nAs to Citibank..  I'm done with you..  Jack my rate to 30% which should be criminal, and then as of April 1st 2010, charge a $60 annual fee just to have the card?!   That's $60 a year, just to have that card empty in your wallet.  Are you kidding me?  This is some kind of joke right?\n\nIt's clear to me that Citibank doesn't give a rats ass about their members if this is the way they plan to treat us..   So fine.. Bye.. I'm done with Citibank forever.. I wont do business with you ever again.. period.\n\nMore over I plan to tell as many people as possible not to do business with Citibank as they are clearly a bunch of crooks..\n","collection":"posts","url":"/fuck-you-citibank/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2010-07-03-lost-in-the-woods-of-c-sharp.md","collection":"posts","url":"/lost-in-the-woods-of-c-sharp/","path":"_posts/2010-07-03-lost-in-the-woods-of-c-sharp.md","id":"/lost-in-the-woods-of-c-sharp","draft":false,"categories":["Software Development"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Lost in the woods of C#","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2010/07/csharpquestion.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2010-07-03 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"lost-in-the-woods-of-c-sharp","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2010-06-29-fuck-you-citibank.md","excerpt":"Well the other day I went to pay off my card and I noticed that they bumped my APR to 29.998%...   Are you fucking kidding me?  30% APR is highway robbery..

You guys ROCK!   Even if the end product is only so so, it still will go a really long way towards a musical reawakening..  I can't wait!!\n\nThis \"game\" will be the next hot ticket you watch.. I put game in quotes because this sucker is transcending game, and becoming something much more..  I really believe everyone will buy this thing, and it will sell like crazy cause suddenly not only will video game enthusiasts buy it for the pure fun of it, but would-be musicians and music teachers alike will use it as a training tool!!!  Awesome sauce.. They just doubled their potential user base..  Probably more really..\n\nMy only concern at this point is screen real estate..  Now they have Vocals, Guitar, Bass, Drums and Keyboard...  Going to be darn hard to fit much more in there unless they start having guitar and bass share a single track or something.. (totally doable..)\n\nI also seriously hope they have a pro-piano mode like the pro-guitar mode promised..   I have a full sized Yamaha keyboard (<a href=\"/play-the-radio/\">that I have talked about before</a>) with midi that is just beginning me to play it..  Either way I'll get to learn to play a guitar one way or the other and have fun doing it..  Just awesome..\n\nI'm so stoked..
