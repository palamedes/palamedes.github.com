Pretty much nothing of any importance that I can think of..\n\nOh well.. yeah I did get married.. but other than that..\n\n<img src=\"/images/photos/wedding/wedding_example1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class='pull-right' />\n\nI finally tied the knot!  And wow did I ever luck out..  On June 2nd 2007 in sunny Las Vegas, I managed to sucker..er marry the lovely and talented Melissa Gail Perkins.  She's now Melissa Ellis.. hehe.. Though she hasn't changed her name yet.. =p  Can't say as I blame her either - holy crap that's a pain in the ass.. (Not the marriage, the name changing..)\n\nEverything was very nice.. And I'm an extremely lucky man.. I love Melissa very much and am tickled to call her my wife.. I very much look forward to spending the rest of my days with this wonderful woman..  (And no she didn't make me say this.. )\n\nMelissa looked awesome in her dress!  We actually went through a lot to keep the dress completely hidden from me until they opened the doors and she walked down the isle.   Oh man.. what a stunner!  I married a knockout.. how the hell did that happen?!  Clearly her taste in men is in question.. heh She just looked fantastic..\n\nI looked like a fat guy in a rented tux..  Or at least that's how I felt..   It's interesting that for a woman to look good to a man, its usually take clothing off.  But for a man to look good to a woman, it's the other way around.   Unfortunately I don't think I look all that good either way.. heh  Tux or no tux..\nWe have a lot of photo's that we need to get sorted and published to the web so everyone can share.  Still waiting to get some from the family as I think some of them are holding out..\n\nWe even had a video made, but haven't gotten that yet.  Which annoys me somewhat to be honest.. I'm afraid its going to fall off the truck or something..\n\nThe reception dinner was very nice.. the food was good, even our cake was good.  In fact I'd say it was darn good.  I was surprised by that..  We both were completely stuffed by the end of the night - and completely zonked.   Our day had started very early (hers earlier than mine) and it was \"go go go\" all day long. So by the time we finally got done, we were done!   Glad I never have to do that again..heh\n\nI must admit though, if I never go to Vegas again it will be too soon.  The magic of the place has just gone.  In the early 90's when I first went there it was a very different place.  I don't like where it has gone now.

And let me say that I find it amusing that English windows does unicode better than Chinese windows.. How is that even possible?!\n\nWe are in the process of internationalizing our product, and we stumbled across this bizarre issue where a person in Taiwan on a Chinese windows machine couldn't enter simplified Chinese into our product.  Doing so would give unpredictable results.\n\nSo, I picked 5 random simplified Chinese characters that sat across the character set;\n\n? - 5355 (16) / E5 8D 95 (8)\n? - 7684 (16) / E7 9A 84 (8)\n? - 7B80 (16) / E7 AE 80 (8)\n? - 6C49 (16) / E6 B1 89 (8)\n? - 5B57 (16) / E5 AD 97 (8)\n\nThese 5 characters are spread nicely across the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unicode.org/cgi-bin/UnihanRadicalIndex.pl?strokes=4&useutf8=false\">Radical-stroke index</a> and all have commonality to one another across UTF-16/UTF-8 and bits.\n\nSo, after much rigmarole I secured myself an account on the box and began to test it, and sure enough these 5 Chinese characters (?????) have proven to me that internationalization stinks.. heh  Depending on the order in which they are placed, random ones would show up..  Rearrange them, double them, spaces between.. whatever.. Always different ones would show.\n\nBut ONLY on the Chinese version of windows.  Locally using our own boxes, it works great. No worries. But over there, strangeness. After much ado and testing both locally and in Taiwan it appears that the Chinese version of windows tries to concatenate the bits of each symbol and make them into a single letter due to them being in a certain order.\n\nIn other words, it's trying to say that X number of characters after the first one are combining characters.  Where X = a random number of them.  And it appears completely random.. No amount of byte/bit/hex/dec whatever seems to pan out to the reason this is happening.\n\nSomething that you'd think the people in Taiwan would know about and maybe give us a clue to -- naw..  So now we have to figure out how to make it work correctly.. *sigh*\n\nPain I tell ya..  Clearly there is a solution.. I mean other people have crossed this bridge..  Though after digging into this it's interesting how many different applications aren't UTF-8 compliant at all.  Linux does this at the OS level, windows doesn't.  The results seem to be that the majority of the software in the windows world thus doesn't correctly support it.\n\nheh the bug tracking tool we use here at work doesn't either, which I find amusing.  Do you know how hard it is to talk about Chinese characters in a tool that wont let you write any?!\n\nMore as we fight through this.. we haven't solved it yet.. it should be interesting to say the least..\n","previous":{"next":{"path":"_posts/2007-05-01-big5-to-utf-8-on-chinese-windows.md","url":"/big5-to-utf-8-on-chinese-windows/","relative_path":"_posts/2007-05-01-big5-to-utf-8-on-chinese-windows.md","id":"/big5-to-utf-8-on-chinese-windows","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Software Development"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Big5 to UTF-8 on Chinese Windows","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2007-05-01 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"big5-to-utf-8-on-chinese-windows","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2007-04-10-tipping-is-a-gratuity.md","output":null,"content":"I really hate how in America today, and most likely the world wide, tipping is required.   Tipping is no longer a gratuity, in that it's not something that is given voluntarily or beyond any obligation but rather it's expected.  And some how if you don't tip beyond a certain amount, you're the bad guy.\n\nIt doesn't matter that the service completely sucked.. No no.. We are the bad ones for not giving them extra money for their crappy service.\n\nI say screw that – if the service sucked then why should we give them a tip at all?!  But I get ahead of myself..  Let me start at the beginning..\n\nMy office went to lunch today to a favorite sushi place that we often frequent.   There were 12 of us and we had an hour or so to get some lunch.  12 is a lot of people and we knew it would be tight trying to do that lunch in that amount of time.. We certainly didn't expect it to take over two hours like it did..\n\nAnyway, as a former waiter myself I understand that it can be tough handling that many people.  It's up to the waiter though to ask for help if they need it, instead of letting the service suffer.  Its also up to management to step in and offer help or assign other people to the ticket if others are needed.\n\nWe all made our order and sat there.. and sat there.. and sat there..  I had originally ordered something and asked for the rolls to be replaced or changed because I didn't really like those, and she flat out refused.  I wasn't ordering a special or anything.. instead she made me order a second plate of what I actually wanted AND the rolls I didn't want (which came with the sushi I did want).. but fine.. I'll do that.. No sense in making things difficult..\n\nI was the first one served.  Both my orders came out about 20 minutes after we ordered and it took another 30 or 40 minutes for the rest of the people to be served (It may have been longer).  By the time the last person was served their food, most people were done..   So.. the last several folks didn't get anything, until the first people had completed their meal..  That's an obscenely long time for a “lunch”.\n\nShe wouldn't split up the check so we had to handle it ourselves.  We pooled some cash and wrote down on the back of the ticket how much to charge to each of the credit cards placed in the little sleeve.\n\nI don't know the total of the bill, but 12 people at a sushi place I'm gonna guess it was around $250..  She counted the cash at the table and there was over $100.. she then ran off to charge the cards.  After ten to fifteen minutes she came back with stuff for us to sign.. We sign and head out.\n\nAll is well I thought.  We got half way backed out of the space when she comes charging out of the restaurant with charge tickets waiving trying to stop us..  Of course we stop, and ask what the problem is. I thought we didn't pay enough.. someone forgot their card.. someone didn't sign.. something..\n\nShe actually said, “You didn't tip!” .... “The amount on the bill wasn't with tip, and you didn't tip but 10%”...    Uh.. you're shitting me right?!  Did you actually just charge after us because you feel we didn't give you a big enough tip?!\n\nWhat the fuck?!  We paid the bill.. Plus gave 10% despite the service, and you actually think it's okay to rush out and confront us about it?    Where do you get off?\n\nIf they don't put the automatic “tip” in with the charge, that's not our fault.   If you would cut the check up into separate bills it would be easier to to tell, again not our fault.   If it didn't take us 2 hours to eat, then maybe we would tip more.. again.. not on us..\n\nBut you don't get to rush out to our car and confront us about it..\n\nAt the end she actually said; “But its only 10%.. there isn't any tip in with the amount of the bill. You only gave me 10%..  But thats okay! Thats just fine!” in a very snotty way, and stormed off..  Basically saying that we only tipped her 10% and she wanted to make sure we knew that she knew.\n\nTipping is a gratuity..  Or should be..  If the service sucks, if they argue with you about your order, if they refuse to split checks, if they take hours to serve, if the fruit on your plate looked like it stayed out too late drinking, or had been served in last nights cocktail.. etc..  It should be okay to express your opinion with your wallet.  Read: “Service sucked, no extra money for you.”\n\nI've been a waiter.. I know the deal.. If I performed poorly I knew I wasn't going to get much.. And I never though it was okay to go confront my customers about it..  That's NEVER okay..  She got 10%, and her final performance was very much like the rest of it – makes me want to ask for that 10% back.\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2007-03-22-webbased-4x-game-in-the-moo-vein.md","url":"/webbased-4x-game-in-the-moo-vein/","relative_path":"_posts/2007-03-22-webbased-4x-game-in-the-moo-vein.md","id":"/webbased-4x-game-in-the-moo-vein","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Webbased 4X game in the MoO vein","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2007-03-22 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"webbased-4x-game-in-the-moo-vein","ext":".md"},"url":"/tipping-is-a-gratuity/","relative_path":"_posts/2007-04-10-tipping-is-a-gratuity.md","id":"/tipping-is-a-gratuity","collection":"posts","excerpt":"I really hate how in America today, and most likely the world wide, tipping is required.
