It’s in a quiet little area in a very tasteful building not hurting anyone.\n\nAnd it seems that about 3 times a week there is a pack of 10 or so college age people standing out side quietly protesting.  All of them wearing the same obnoxious t-shirt with anti-abortion rhetoric and wearing tape over their mouths acting like they were the “baby” that was killed.   All quietly standing next to their BMW’s and Jags saying that you’re a bad person and should be prisoned for murder.\n\nMy initial thought was, what the hell don’t these children have anything better to do?!\n\nBut the more I thought about it the more it pissed me off.  And now all I can think is; how dare they?!\n\nThese kids are actually protesting the actions of people who are in very hard situations; situations that they themselves have NEVER been in.  More than half of the protesters were men!\n\nYou’ve never been pregnant while standing between a rock and a hard place..  Yet you have the raw audacity to stand there and judge a persons action, when you yourself haven’t had to make that choice?!  Fuck you!\n\nThey say that “adoption” is an option, yet none of them are familiar with the process or the foster care system. More over, all of them are out there saying you should do something that they themselves aren’t willing to do!  I assure you, none of those twenty-something’s have adopted a child.   A painfully clear case of “do what I say, not what I do.”\n\nAt the end of the day, or whenever they get tired – these kids all get back in their BMW’s and jags that mommy and daddy are paying for and drive home.  They haven’t a clue what others are going through or how hard their lives could be.\n\nI seriously don’t understand people..  Why do people think they have a right to judge the actions of others, especially when they haven’t had to make those decisions themselves?  I mean it’s very easy to stand back and armchair the world.. but when you actually live it life gets a little more complex.  Most of those decisions are very hard, and not easily made.\n\nPeople making those decisions sure as hell don’t need some snot nosed juvenile barely off their mothers tit to cast their trained opinions at them..\n\nUltimately it comes down to this;\n\n  * You don’t get to tell others what to do..\n  * You shouldn’t get to pressure people into doing what you want them to either..\n  * And you certainly don’t get to judge people who make actions contrary to your beliefs, especially when you yourself haven’t lived this situation..\n\n\n---\n\n####Legacy Comments\n\nJivinJ - Monday, Aug 13th 2007 at 12:34 pm\n\n        Aren’t you judging the actions of these protesters?\n\n        Aren’t you saying that they shouldn’t be doing what they are doing?\n\n        How do you know that none of the females protesting haven’t been pregnant? Did you talk to them?\n\n\n<i class='icon-star'></i> Jason - Monday, Aug 13th 2007 at 12:57 pm\n\n        Sorry but “Don’t judge me, while I judge others” isn’t a valid argument. That dog don’t hunt.\n\n        Granted, I’m judging people.  But I’m judging those who are themselves judging others in a very public and extremely obnoxious way. That in my mind opens them up to comment. They want to be viewed and commented about, or they wouldn’t be standing on the street corner with their shirts and attitudes.\n\n        Where as they are judging those who want to be left alone and not judged. People who are going through a tough time and probably have made a very hard decision — or in some way need help (Not public scrutiny.)\n\n        And no.. I have not spoken to them. Today as I went by there was only one woman, and she was very young. While she may have gone through what others have, the 7 men (I drove by at lunch to check) have most likely not come up preggers..\n\n        Either way.. my last point stands.. You don’t get to tell people what to do, you don’t get to pressure people to do what you want..\n\n        Additional — I also find it extremely amusing that the very first comment, not even an hour after I posted, was from a holy roller pro-lifer who’s likely more interested in telling others how they should live than actually living themselves ( He left a link. ). Get off your box man — leave people alone.\n\n\nRon - Tuesday, Oct 16th 2007 at 1:30 pm\n\n        I don’t undrstand your argument or how you can have an objection to these young people. They are desperately trying to save the lives of babies who are powerless to help themselves from being murdered. How can you or anyone else justify the slaughter of these children for the sake of what the parent is going through?\n\n        I have heard of all the arguments of why abortion is just OK to do, but just because there is a law that says you can do it, doesn’t mean that the act is diminished. It is still child murder, and all the justifications in the world can’t change that. You can’t just wish your atrocities away into the cornfield!\n\n\n<i class='icon-star'></i> Jason - Tuesday, Oct 23rd 2007 at 10:15 am\n\n        “Murder” is the crime of unlawfully killing a person especially with malice aforethought. (http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/murder)\n\n        For there to be “murder”, there must be a crime.\n\n        Since abortion is not illegal, it is not a crime — therefore it isn’t murder.\n\n        However, I’ll play your little game. If abortion is murder — what punishment should we hand out to the woman? How much time should she do for that murder?\n\n        The death penalty? Or if she’s answerable to God, then why make it illegal in the first place? I’m fairly certain that God doesn’t need your help. If this is a matter between the woman and God why are you sticking your nose in to it at all? (Oh right.. Christianity.. I forgot..)\n\n        The problem I have is that you’re willing to fight to outlaw abortion, but not fight to ensure good and effective birth control to help prevent conception in the first place. You don’t fight for easy free access to neonatal care, or quicker adoption programs or any other benefit to expecting mothers who don’t want the child — underprivileged or otherwise.\n\n        You could easily advocate all manner of good things from the government to better this situation which you call murder, but you don’t.\n\n        All you give a shit about is the fetus while its in utero. Once it gets its first cry suddenly in your eyes its just another poverty stricken criminal-in-waiting whelpling born of a morally questionable whore and an anonymous baby-daddy that’s stealing money from welfare, not giving back to society and dragging the rest of us down.\n\n        Your narrow minded morality tale doesn’t impress me — you’re only true interest is forcing all of us to live by your mores by any means. Religious fascists by any other name.\n\n        How many children have you adopted?","previous":{"path":"_posts/2007-08-12-mental-note-boiling-oil-hot.md","url":"/mental-note-boiling-oil-hot/","relative_path":"_posts/2007-08-12-mental-note-boiling-oil-hot.md","id":"/mental-note-boiling-oil-hot","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Mental Note:  Boiling oil = HOT!","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2007/08/owwie.jpg","ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2007-08-12 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"mental-note-boiling-oil-hot","ext":".md"},"url":"/how-dare-you-judge/","relative_path":"_posts/2007-08-13-how-dare-you-judge.md","id":"/how-dare-you-judge","collection":"posts","excerpt":"<p>So near where I work there is a Planned Parenthood facility.

Not much else you can do to burns..\n\nKeeping it submerged in cold water on and off for the first couple of hours makes it not hurt.. and now its just a matter of wiping off the seepage every so often.\n\nIt doesn't hurt at all now.. except when I bump it..

I ask you, is it possible for the RIAA to display more greed or avarice without actually hiring Satan as its general counsel?\n\nThe RIAA is known for <a href=\"http://www.musiccdsettlement.com/english/default.htm\" target=\"_blank\">alienating it's fans by over charging</a>, <a href=\"http://archive.salon.com/21st/feature/1998/10/28feature.html\" target=\"_blank\">completely failing to embrace any semblance of new technology</a> and then <a href=\"http://www.droxy.com/2005/09/29/riaa-doesnt-like-new-satellite-portable-music-unit/\" target=\"_blank\">sues anyone who tries to give music fans what they want</a>.\n\nThe \"Recording Industry Artists Association\" (RIAA) has not one damn thing to do with the artists. And now, as a thank you to the artists that made the RIAA what it is, the RIAA is making moves to reduce artist royalty payments.\n\nThe RIAA is burning the candle at both ends.  They are pissing off consumers, and pissing on the artists they supposedly support.  It really does seem like every decision they make has something to do with the limiting of the exposure of the music that artists create. This is contrary to anything that an artist would want, but then the simple fact of the matter is the RIAA has NOTHING to do with artists.\n\nThe latest in a long line of unbelievable bullshit that they are actually getting away with is the decision that was pushed through in March by the United States Copyright Royalty Board (CRB) which will make all webcasting royalties going forward, AND dating back to 2006 so expensive as to make any kind of legal streaming station completely unfeasible.\n\nThis is an attempt by the RIAA to kill any and all streaming music on the internet, further limiting exposure of their clients content.\n\nDigitally Imported Radio (<a href=\"http://di.fm\" target=\"_blank\">http://di.fm</a>) one of my favorite stations which I happily pay a fee to has stated;\n  * The new fees, making us owe literally more than *two million dollars* due July 15th, do not take any realistic business model of a service such as ours and most others on the web into account.  The short story translation is that Digitally Imported the company already owes just for 2006 many many times more in royalty fees than all combined revenue generated.\n  * Imagine a picture similar to if for every $1 we earn before even any expenses, we actually owe about $5 in royalty fees.\n  * This situation spells doom for webcasting on the Internet, and many services such as Digitally Imported Radio will be forced to stop all public webcasting, switch to subscriptions only, or SHUT DOWN ENTIRELY - WITHIN MONTHS, IF NOT WEEKS!\nWhat?! God damn it!  I actually like di.fm.. I think they are great!   I can tell you right now my productivity at work will slip if my music goes away, but thats another story..\n\nYou may be saying, \"Well the CRB isn't the RIAA\".. True, however the it was the RIAA's idea.  The whole thing got pushed through by SoundExchange which is a non-profit organization originally created and puppetted by the RIAA.\n\nBasically what they have done is passed a law that states that any web broadcasting business is not taxed on the amount of people that actually make a purchase, but rather they're taxed on every person that happens to listen to the stream at all.\n\nImagine if you will, that your favorite FM radio station incurred a fee every time someone channel surfed by their station.  Oh you heard a 3 second clip of XYZ song, pay us $1.  Yes it's that bad.\n\nThis crap forces the small law abiding independent webcasters to switch to the dark side, and become illegal if they want to stay in any kind of business.   Suddenly they have to leave the US to continue their business.  In most cases this wont work either as there are legal precedents that have established that as long as the listener is in the US, they are still liable.  And affordable high capacity bandwidth in the US also make moving to another country highly unlikely..\n\nSomething to think about:\n\nTerrestrial AM/FM radio stations in the US pay nothing for recording industry royalties due to a law made in consideration of promotion value that playing provides in return.\n\nSatellite Radio services have to pay 7.5% of revenue - which I think is a bit high, but I understand the reason since its a subscriber system anyway - there typically isn't a \"free\" satellite station.\n\nThe new law makes webcasters have to pay any where from 100% to 500% of revenue.\n\nArtists, you MUST distance yourself from the RIAA.

And let me say that I find it amusing that English windows does unicode better than Chinese windows.. How is that even possible?!\n\nWe are in the process of internationalizing our product, and we stumbled across this bizarre issue where a person in Taiwan on a Chinese windows machine couldn't enter simplified Chinese into our product.  Doing so would give unpredictable results.\n\nSo, I picked 5 random simplified Chinese characters that sat across the character set;\n\n? - 5355 (16) / E5 8D 95 (8)\n? - 7684 (16) / E7 9A 84 (8)\n? - 7B80 (16) / E7 AE 80 (8)\n? - 6C49 (16) / E6 B1 89 (8)\n? - 5B57 (16) / E5 AD 97 (8)\n\nThese 5 characters are spread nicely across the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unicode.org/cgi-bin/UnihanRadicalIndex.pl?strokes=4&useutf8=false\">Radical-stroke index</a> and all have commonality to one another across UTF-16/UTF-8 and bits.\n\nSo, after much rigmarole I secured myself an account on the box and began to test it, and sure enough these 5 Chinese characters (?????) have proven to me that internationalization stinks.. heh  Depending on the order in which they are placed, random ones would show up..  Rearrange them, double them, spaces between.. whatever.. Always different ones would show.\n\nBut ONLY on the Chinese version of windows.  Locally using our own boxes, it works great. No worries. But over there, strangeness. After much ado and testing both locally and in Taiwan it appears that the Chinese version of windows tries to concatenate the bits of each symbol and make them into a single letter due to them being in a certain order.\n\nIn other words, it's trying to say that X number of characters after the first one are combining characters.  Where X = a random number of them.  And it appears completely random.. No amount of byte/bit/hex/dec whatever seems to pan out to the reason this is happening.\n\nSomething that you'd think the people in Taiwan would know about and maybe give us a clue to -- naw..  So now we have to figure out how to make it work correctly.. *sigh*\n\nPain I tell ya..  Clearly there is a solution.. I mean other people have crossed this bridge..  Though after digging into this it's interesting how many different applications aren't UTF-8 compliant at all.  Linux does this at the OS level, windows doesn't.  The results seem to be that the majority of the software in the windows world thus doesn't correctly support it.\n\nheh the bug tracking tool we use here at work doesn't either, which I find amusing.  Do you know how hard it is to talk about Chinese characters in a tool that wont let you write any?!\n\nMore as we fight through this.. we haven't solved it yet.. it should be interesting to say the least..\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2007-04-10-tipping-is-a-gratuity.md","url":"/tipping-is-a-gratuity/","relative_path":"_posts/2007-04-10-tipping-is-a-gratuity.md","id":"/tipping-is-a-gratuity","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Tipping is a gratuity!","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2007-04-10 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"tipping-is-a-gratuity","ext":".md"},"url":"/big5-to-utf-8-on-chinese-windows/","relative_path":"_posts/2007-05-01-big5-to-utf-8-on-chinese-windows.md","id":"/big5-to-utf-8-on-chinese-windows","collection":"posts","excerpt":"Microsoft has yet again been a source of pain for me..
