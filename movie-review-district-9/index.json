But compared to average (likely) weight of the folks walking around that convention center.. I'm doing just fine.\n\nIt really did seem like there were very few average build people walking around.   Everybody was either rail thin and pasty or extremely heavy.   Sad really.\n\nThe one thing I was plesantly surprised about was the lack of smell.  I went expecting the unwashed nerds problem you typically see at comic-cons etc..  But clearly the blizzcon attracts a higher class of dork, as we all know how to use soap.  Yay us!    (Yes, I fully include myself as one of the dorks.. High class dork thank you..)\n\nFor me the major disappointment in the whole trip was that no mention was made of the new MMO that blizzard is working on.  It's been in the rumor mill for a while now that they are working on some brand new MMO with completely new IP.  Some folks say it will be a Starcraft MMO but most say that's not the case..  Beyond that.. nothing.\n\nI really had hoped they'd give us a clue as to what it would be, but I guess that will be next years blizzcon.. heh  I have lots more to say about this whole event and I'll get to it eventually but right now I'm tired.\n\nI will say that it was a good time, and I wouldn't mind going again.   I hated the flights of course, primarily because I don't like flying but that's hardly blizzards fault..  I also wished there weren't thirty thousand people there as it was silly to have to wait in line, in order to get in line to try something.. yeah not kidding.. it was like being jammed in an elevator..  (An elevator that has over 813000 square feet of space.. Yes its that big.. and yes it was that full..)\n\nBut those things aside.. it was good.\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2009-08-20-god-i-hate-planes.md","url":"/god-i-hate-planes/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-08-20-god-i-hate-planes.md","id":"/god-i-hate-planes","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"God I hate planes","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-08-20 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"god-i-hate-planes","ext":".md"},"url":"/back-from-blizzcon-2009/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-08-24-back-from-blizzcon-2009.md","id":"/back-from-blizzcon-2009","collection":"posts","excerpt":"Well the wife and I are back from Blizzcon..  I have to admit she had a pretty good idea of going and now that we have gone and come back I'm glad we did it..","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Back from Blizzcon 2009","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2009/08/blizzcon-logo.png","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-08-24 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"back-from-blizzcon-2009","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2009-08-20-god-i-hate-planes.md","output":null,"content":"Dear god but I hate flying on major airlines.  It's just not happy fun time for me.\n\nFirstly, I get an awful headache as soon as the cabin pressurizes.  I don't know why and I wish like hell it didn't happen, but it does.   It doesn't help my cherub like demeanor one bit is all I'm saying.\n\nSecondly, you're in close proximity to a lot of people for a long time and I am anything but a people person.  Again this does nothing for my attitude.\n\nThirdly, I swear these seats are getting smaller.  I know I'm no spring chicken and need to lose weight but this is silly.  Even Melissa looks cramped.\n\nFinally the smells on this plane are starting to annoy.\n\nOne woman showed up with a very small baby that I had expected would be crying nonstop.  Not a sound so far. I thought, \"Wow what a good baby.\" Then the smell began.  He pooped.  And based soley on the baby-poo miasma that is floating through this cabin it must have been one hell of a load.\n\nA few minutes later the woman behind us thought it was a perfectly reasonable time to paint her nails.  I shit you not.  On a plane with a closed air system she decides it's okay to unleash fumey nail polish stink on the whole plane.\n\nUnreal.  So now I'm sitting here typing this on my iPhone as the baby goes for round two and I cant help but ponder about the possible colors of baby-poop nail polish.\n\nGood times.\n","previous":{"next":{"path":"_posts/2009-08-20-god-i-hate-planes.md","url":"/god-i-hate-planes/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-08-20-god-i-hate-planes.md","id":"/god-i-hate-planes","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"God I hate planes","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-08-20 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"god-i-hate-planes","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2009-08-15-movie-review-district-9.md","output":null,"content":"<img title=\"District 9\" src=\"/images/2009/08/district9-poster-200x300.jpg\" alt=\"District 9\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" class='pull-right' />\n\nMy initial reaction to District 9, upon the movie ending was to say -- and I quote; \"What the fuck was that?!\"  I sort of felt like my soul had just been raped, and I was just beginning to feel the crush of information as I processed the movie I had just watched..\n\nLet me start by saying that District 9 is an extremely interesting movie and most likely not what you will expect..  In fact I described it to my best friend as being \"completely fucked up and horribly dark with a message that is delivered in an extremely heavy handed manner --  but at the same time.. kinda cool..\"   And I stand by that description now that I have had time to process..\n\nIt wasn't bad.  It really wasn't.. even though my review is harsh, I kind of liked it and will watch it again 'cause I'm sure there was a lot I missed..\n\nHowever, this movie makes no attempt to hide that it has a message, and by god you're going to get the message like it or not..  For the first 3/4 of the movie the happy go-lucky recently promoted dork goes about committing what amounts to horribly brutal and inhumane acts..

(assuming he keeps his brains in his head.. )\n\nWe know nothing about this goo other than it's bad for humans, it's impossibly hard to create, and apparently a couple drops will power a space ship the size of a city across a galaxy..   Huge holes around the goo, but fine.. cheap plot device -- the aliens struggled for 20 years to create it -- its very important to them in that it powers their ship and is the reason they are stuck here -- it turns humans into prawns -- and is now in the hands of the humans.\n\nSuddenly due to the infection the dork has his entire life stripped away from him; his hot wife, his new job, his dorky identity.. he's portrayed to the media as this highly contagious alien fornicator (prawn fucker) and is on the run from the law.. There is only one place he can go!  Guess where.. Go ahead and guess..\n\nYou even have other painful cliche characters like;\n\n* The overzealous military guy who just loves pulling the wings off flies..\n* The innocent and way too hot wife of the dork who loves her man.. is mad at her man.. wants nothing to do with her man.. no no wait.. she forgives him.. loves her man again..\n* The gun running, drug doing, voodoo gang over lord who you just know will cause all manner of trouble.. for no good reason other than \"you had your chance, its my turn to have the power now..\"\n* The token black guy being trained for the dorks job and was the only guy on the team that was specifically not given a kevlar vest to wearing. \"Don't worry about it.. wear this red shirt instead..\"\n* And of course.. the evil father-in-law that secretly had been running covert body snatcher like biological experiments on the prawns all along and now was going to have the newly infected son-in-law killed because his organization needs his DNA in order to be able to use the alien weapons..   wait.. what?!\n\nI mean seriously it's painfully obvious where it's going to go.. It just took a long time to get there..  He slowly learns the errors of his ways and decides to help the main protagonist prawn get his prawny son, two characters we really knew very little about but who in the end are more humane than we are, to the mother ship before ultimately turning into a prawn himself.\n\nSo.. The dork, who at this point is half turning into an alien gathers up alien and human weapons by force from the gun running voodoo guy and storms the organizations compound in order to get the goo back, all the while the gun running voodoo guy is threatening revenge..\n\nAnd so begins the running fire fight which would be the new mode of the movie from here on out..\n\nSuddenly the part of Peter Jackson is played by Micheal Bay.. And we are rewarded for our sticking out the \"message\" portion of the movie with lots of bullets and explosions -- and of course some of the best CG \"mech\" porn I have seen in a long time... in fact.. ever..\n\nReally I can simply describe everything from this point on as a constant running firefight with the main dork redeeming himself by killing everyone from the inside of an extremely well done CG mech.\n\nThe movie itself looks sort of like black hawk down with aliens..  The attention to detail everywhere was actually pretty darn good..  The aliens looked great!  And the special effects for the alien weaponry, especially the mech was very well done.  I was less impressed by the ships.. but what can ya do..\n\nThe dork, now hero, escorts the main prawn protagonist as far as he can,  even going as far as to say \"go on without me, don't make my sacrifice for nothing..\"\n\nThe prawn says, with a black tear in his eye, \"I'll be back in three years.. I promise..\"  Then turns and runs to the ship while the dork/hero continues to fight on.  He eventually gets to the ship, takes off.. and flies away.\n\nThe dork/hero's mech finally is destroyed -- opens up and coughs the hero out as it colapses into a heap and of course the cliche military guy comes up and gives a nice monolog about how he will enjoy killing the dork/hero..  Which never happens because all the rest of the prawns run up and rip him to shreds..\n\nThe end.\n\nOr is it?  The last thing we see is confirmation that the dork/hero has turned fully into a prawn and we know that all the prawns left on Earth have been moved from district 9 to district 10..   I'm pretty damned sure there was some foreshadowing being hammered into us here too..  The \"3 years\" number was thrown around quite a lot.. and moving them from District 9 to District 10 seemed obvious... etc..\n\nThe movie had gaping plot holes.. Completely underdeveloped or not even remotely developed main characters..  It had a horrible and down right offensive message that was delivered in quite possibly the worst way.. And really had very few redeeming qualities..  I seriously hope they don't make a sequel.. However, if they do it would almost have to be better than the first one..\n\nSo having said that;  I kind of liked it..  The visuals were good candy, and I do like my candy but the rest of it kind of hurt..\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2009-08-14-28-hdmi-monitor.md","url":"/28-hdmi-monitor/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-08-14-28-hdmi-monitor.md","id":"/28-hdmi-monitor","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"28\" HDMI Monitor","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2009/08/monitor-150x150.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-08-14 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"28-hdmi-monitor","ext":".md"},"url":"/movie-review-district-9/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-08-15-movie-review-district-9.md","id":"/movie-review-district-9","collection":"posts","excerpt":"My initial reaction to District 9, upon the movie ending was to say -- and I quote; \"What the fuck was that?!\"  I sort of felt like my soul had just been raped, and I was just beginning to feel the crush of information as I processed the movie I had just watched..","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Movie Review: District 9","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2009/08/district9-poster-200x300.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-08-15 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"movie-review-district-9","ext":".md"},"url":"/god-i-hate-planes/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-08-20-god-i-hate-planes.md","id":"/god-i-hate-planes","collection":"posts","excerpt":"Dear god but I hate flying on major airlines.

Go ahead and guess..\n\nYou even have other painful cliche characters like;\n\n* The overzealous military guy who just loves pulling the wings off flies..\n* The innocent and way too hot wife of the dork who loves her man.. is mad at her man.. wants nothing to do with her man.. no no wait.. she forgives him.. loves her man again..\n* The gun running, drug doing, voodoo gang over lord who you just know will cause all manner of trouble.. for no good reason other than \"you had your chance, its my turn to have the power now..\"\n* The token black guy being trained for the dorks job and was the only guy on the team that was specifically not given a kevlar vest to wearing. \"Don't worry about it.. wear this red shirt instead..\"\n* And of course.. the evil father-in-law that secretly had been running covert body snatcher like biological experiments on the prawns all along and now was going to have the newly infected son-in-law killed because his organization needs his DNA in order to be able to use the alien weapons..   wait.. what?!\n\nI mean seriously it's painfully obvious where it's going to go.. It just took a long time to get there..  He slowly learns the errors of his ways and decides to help the main protagonist prawn get his prawny son, two characters we really knew very little about but who in the end are more humane than we are, to the mother ship before ultimately turning into a prawn himself.\n\nSo.. The dork, who at this point is half turning into an alien gathers up alien and human weapons by force from the gun running voodoo guy and storms the organizations compound in order to get the goo back, all the while the gun running voodoo guy is threatening revenge..\n\nAnd so begins the running fire fight which would be the new mode of the movie from here on out..\n\nSuddenly the part of Peter Jackson is played by Micheal Bay.. And we are rewarded for our sticking out the \"message\" portion of the movie with lots of bullets and explosions -- and of course some of the best CG \"mech\" porn I have seen in a long time... in fact.. ever..\n\nReally I can simply describe everything from this point on as a constant running firefight with the main dork redeeming himself by killing everyone from the inside of an extremely well done CG mech.\n\nThe movie itself looks sort of like black hawk down with aliens..  The attention to detail everywhere was actually pretty darn good..  The aliens looked great!  And the special effects for the alien weaponry, especially the mech was very well done.  I was less impressed by the ships.. but what can ya do..\n\nThe dork, now hero, escorts the main prawn protagonist as far as he can,  even going as far as to say \"go on without me, don't make my sacrifice for nothing..\"\n\nThe prawn says, with a black tear in his eye, \"I'll be back in three years.. I promise..\"  Then turns and runs to the ship while the dork/hero continues to fight on.  He eventually gets to the ship, takes off.. and flies away.\n\nThe dork/hero's mech finally is destroyed -- opens up and coughs the hero out as it colapses into a heap and of course the cliche military guy comes up and gives a nice monolog about how he will enjoy killing the dork/hero..  Which never happens because all the rest of the prawns run up and rip him to shreds..\n\nThe end.\n\nOr is it?  The last thing we see is confirmation that the dork/hero has turned fully into a prawn and we know that all the prawns left on Earth have been moved from district 9 to district 10..   I'm pretty damned sure there was some foreshadowing being hammered into us here too..  The \"3 years\" number was thrown around quite a lot.. and moving them from District 9 to District 10 seemed obvious... etc..\n\nThe movie had gaping plot holes.. Completely underdeveloped or not even remotely developed main characters..  It had a horrible and down right offensive message that was delivered in quite possibly the worst way.. And really had very few redeeming qualities..  I seriously hope they don't make a sequel.. However, if they do it would almost have to be better than the first one..\n\nSo having said that;  I kind of liked it..  The visuals were good candy, and I do like my candy but the rest of it kind of hurt..\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2009-08-14-28-hdmi-monitor.md","url":"/28-hdmi-monitor/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-08-14-28-hdmi-monitor.md","id":"/28-hdmi-monitor","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"28\" HDMI Monitor","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2009/08/monitor-150x150.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-08-14 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"28-hdmi-monitor","ext":".md"},"url":"/movie-review-district-9/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-08-15-movie-review-district-9.md","id":"/movie-review-district-9","collection":"posts","excerpt":"My initial reaction to District 9, upon the movie ending was to say -- and I quote; \"What the fuck was that?!\"  I sort of felt like my soul had just been raped, and I was just beginning to feel the crush of information as I processed the movie I had just watched..","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Movie Review: District 9","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2009/08/district9-poster-200x300.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-08-15 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"movie-review-district-9","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2009-08-14-28-hdmi-monitor.md","output":null,"content":"<img title=\"Huge Monitor\" src=\"/images/2009/08/monitor-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Huge Monitor\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" class='pull-right' />\n\nSo Tigerdirect was having a hell of a deal on something I have sorta wanted for  a while...   I have been playing games, programming, and generally tooling around on a 20\" wide screen monitor for years now.\n\nMy old 20\" wide screen viewsonic worked great to be sure..  I really liked it and when I moved it from my old 17\" square monitor I thought I had found eden..   Well let me tellya..

As soon as I turned it on it was blinding compared to my old screen..  I'm sure I'll get used to it, but dang..\n\nThe other thing that was fun was that I logged into my current first person shooter and had to actually turn my head, to see the whole screen!!! hehe   Gona give a couple of my simulation games a try here soon..

src=\"/images/2009/08/defender1-champ-online-415-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Champions Online\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" />\n\nOkay I know I'm not supposed to talk about this yet, but it's near enough to open beta that I feel I can safely talk about the game without giving anything important away -- or at the very least I think I'm safe from being sued..  (Please don't sue me..)\n\nI have been in the Champions Online closed beta pretty much since day one and I can say without much hesitation that the game is not horrible. In fact I would go as far as to say its pretty good and appears to be getting better with each patch..\n\nI certainly can say that as the beta has progressed the game has gotten Waaaaayy better and will very likely continue to do so for a good while yet..  And I can further say that it's good enough for me to actually purchase and play the game after release, but there are issues I hope get solved..\n\nFrom day 1 when I started in the beta I had extremely high hopes.   Extremely high..  Like.. Too high.. heh\n\nI wanted Champions online to be exactly what Champions is;  a \"sky is the limit\" paper and pencil role playing game where the player can create any kind of hero they want and effectively play within the realm of the GM's imagination..   If you as a player could imagine it,  then you could do it!  Booyah baby!\n\nI pretty much had the same hopes for City of Heroes previously and of course was let down for many of the same reasons which I'll get to..  (Note;  I liked City of Heroes and played it for a good long time but it never had the freedom and versatility that it had originally promised. )\n\nChampions Online suffers from this exact same issue -- our expectations are too high.  It's completely unrealistic to think that they could create a game where players could be ANYTHING..  I mean how do you even create the framework that can encompass a whole generation of players imaginations?!  Powers, Abilities, Costumes.. etc   You can't.. Period.. There's just no way..\n\nThis problem isn't really a problem, it's a matter of the player needing to lower their expectations a tad..   But they did call their game \"Champions\" online so of course that makes people hope for just such a thing..\n\nSo instead of trying they went the same route that they had used with City of Heroes, which is a good thing to be honest.\n\nWhat they did was to limit everything down to a set or subset of powers that you can choose from when building your super hero.  They do the same thing with costumes in that there are a finite number of elements you can choose from.\n\nIn City of Heroes you could spend days just playing with the character creator designing your hero.. Not powers or attributes, but just creating what your hero looks like.  Multiply that by a factor of 4 and you have the new character creator.  It's quite nice in that you can create just about anything.    I had a lot of fun tooling around in the character generator and made all manner of silly to serious characters.  The creator had some bugs of course, its still early in development, but it was still pretty neat.\n\nThe power sets right now seem somewhat limited..  I wish/want there to be way more powers.. I also was under the impression that we would have more control over what powers looked like..  I swear I read somewhere that you could have the same \"blast\" power that someone else had, but you could control what it graphically looks like or what color it was etc.. and that's not the case..  In some cases you can control where the power originates (hands, head, chest..etc) but that seems to be it..\n\nMaybe later in the game you can control how powers appear but for now I don't see that ability..\n\nThe game play is sort of what you'd expect from \"City of Heroes' 2\" which is all Champions Online is.  Its fun, but don't expect anything super awesome like..\n\nMy major complaint with the game at this point was a graphic setting that defaulted to on, and made the game look horrible..   They had \"Depth of Field\" turned on, which meant that the farther away from the camera an object/item/scene was, the blurier it was.  It got so blurry during one scene it was hard to look at.. it actually made me a little ill..  I had to turn DOF off completely..\n\nI'm not sure I fully appreciate the cell shading thing to be honest.. I understand why they went that way, and I believe in the long run it will stand the test of time better than a more \"realistic\" theme..  I just don't really like it yet..   I have the same issue with the stylistic graphics of World of Warcraft.. its just a personal opinion thing really..\n\nAll in all I think the game is good..\n\nI very much recommend it.. and if you liked City of Heroes I think you'll really like Champions Online..\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2009-08-06-offensive-footwear.md","url":"/offensive-footwear/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-08-06-offensive-footwear.md","id":"/offensive-footwear","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Offensive footwear!","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2009/08/feets-150x150.png","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-08-06 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"offensive-footwear","ext":".md"},"url":"/game-review-champions-online/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-08-12-game-review-champions-online.md","id":"/game-review-champions-online","collection":"posts","excerpt":"Okay I know I'm not supposed to talk about this yet, but it's near enough to open beta that I feel I can safely talk about the game without giving anything important away -- or at the very least I think I'm safe from being sued..  (Please don't sue me..)","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Game Review: Champions Online","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2009/08/defender1-champ-online-415-150x150.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-08-12 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"game-review-champions-online","ext":".md"},"url":"/28-hdmi-monitor/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-08-14-28-hdmi-monitor.md","id":"/28-hdmi-monitor","collection":"posts","excerpt":"So Tigerdirect was having a hell of a deal on something I have sorta wanted for  a while...   I have been playing games, programming, and generally tooling around on a 20\" wide screen monitor for years now.","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"28\" HDMI Monitor","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2009/08/monitor-150x150.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-08-14 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"28-hdmi-monitor","ext":".md"},"url":"/movie-review-district-9/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-08-15-movie-review-district-9.md","id":"/movie-review-district-9","collection":"posts","excerpt":"My initial reaction to District 9, upon the movie ending was to say -- and I quote; \"What the fuck was that?!\"  I sort of felt like my soul had just been raped, and I was just beginning to feel the crush of information as I processed the movie I had just watched..","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Movie Review: District 9","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2009/08/district9-poster-200x300.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-08-15 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"movie-review-district-9","ext":".md"}
