Frankly, I think the movement mechanics are great!   And the cover system is fantastic, unlike some other games I have played recently..  It did take a little getting used to some aspects of it; like I'd prefer the shift key to not be a toggle for run/walk but rather be a press and hold kind of thing but that's largely because it's what I'm used to with other games, not because its inherently wrong..\n\nThere are lots of different weapons that you can use ( or not use ) and you have options to upgrade them..  There are also a whole pack of different thrown gadgets that you can use and they all have their use..\n\nI also really like the color vs black/white mechanic..  At first I thought this would be jarring and break the suspension of disbelief but the opposite was true.. I feel it actually helps a lot..\n\nLots of textual help everywhere which again I thought would be distracting or break the suspension, but actually they way they worked it in was great and made it sorta feel like a movie..\n\nReally my complaints about the game are minor;\n\n1.  The game is short -- I finished the game in 11 hours, and I was going slow.. I'm pretty sure you could finish it a heck of a lot faster than that if you tried..  It seemed really complete though in that the 11 hours was packed with stuff to do, but I kinda wish games were longer.. they seem to be getting shorter and shorter.\n\n2.  Very linear -- to be expected really.. There is usually only one way to go..\n\n3.  A couple of the levels need more direction -- the car garage sneak event annoyed me and really was the only level that kinda pissed me off, but primarily because I had no idea where I was supposed to go and it took me several tries..\n\n4.  PRODUCT PLACEMENT!!  Dear god..  I wonder how much Cisco and the producers of the new Nightmare on Elm Street paid to get their product so highly and obviously placed in the game..  Frankly this was jarring.. I didn't like this..  All computer monitors can be destroyed!! uh.. unless there is a Cisco logo on it, then no..  etc..  There were others.. it was annoying..\n\n5.  And finally the AI, while not dreadfully stupid the enemy aren't too bright.. For example I was right around the corner from a guy who knew I was there.. he had the brilliant idea of throwing a frag grenade at me.. it basically dropped at his feet and I just remained hidden while he died.. heh  it was amusing, but kinda dumb..   The biggest issue is that they are constantly yelling what they are doing which they took directly from FEAR and was a problem in that game too that I know folks complained about..  Oh well..\n\nAll in all it was a great game.. and I will likely play it again on hard..\n\nI think I actually give this one 4.5 out of 5 stars.\n","collection":"posts","url":"/game-review-splintercell-conviction/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2010-05-13-game-review-napoleon-total-war.md","collection":"posts","url":"/game-review-napoleon-total-war/","path":"_posts/2010-05-13-game-review-napoleon-total-war.md","id":"/game-review-napoleon-total-war","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Game Review: Napoleon Total War","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2010/05/napoleon-150x150.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":true,"allow_comments":false,"date":"2010-05-13 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"game-review-napoleon-total-war","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2010-05-01-game-review-splintercell-conviction.md","excerpt":"I really like a good first person shooter..  But most FPS games these days aren't about thinking or planning your way out, they are just run and gun, \"zerg-fests\" where you run in shoot a few..","id":"/game-review-splintercell-conviction","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Game Review: Splintercell Conviction","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2010/05/tom_clancys_splinter_cell_conviction-4.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":true,"allow_comments":false,"date":"2010-05-01 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"game-review-splintercell-conviction","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2010-05-13-game-review-napoleon-total-war.md","content":"<img title=\"Napoleon Total War\" src=\"/images/2010/05/napoleon-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Napoleon Total War\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" class='pull-right' />\n\nI have always been a fan of the Total War franchise, but in my opinion none of them have been all that great.  Good and fun in most cases, sure.. but great?  Eh not really..  All of them have had their share of issues of which Napoleon TW shares some of them.. NTW is by far the most refined version so far and a lot of fun but, I'm not quite sure it peeks the \"great\" meter just yet.. I will say its pretty darn good and a lot of fun though..\n\nTotally worth the price as it's clear to me that Creative Assembly (the developers) are getting better at their craft but the game has one staggering short fall that it shares with all it's siblings;  Horrible AI.\n\nThis is the 6th iteration of the game core concept and the AI is still just dreadful..  I'm pretty sure we could train a monkey to play the game better..  I know AI is very complex and as a programmer myself I'm not sure how to solve this problem, but dang..  The computer is down right bad.   Given enough time you probably could beat any army with just about any force..  It's actually fun trying to do just that.. heh\n\nIn comparison to Empire Total War, it's immediate predecessor, Napoleon is the clear winner.  The game is much more polished and refined than ETW ever was and it makes me feel like ETW was what NTW was supposed to be, but they ran out of time and money..  I will say that the AI in NTW is better than ETW, but when up is the only possible direction....\n\nI will say this, NTW is beautiful.. There is nothing cooler than watching your line of infantry slowly disappear in a hazy cloud of black powder smoke as a line of enemy advance forward.. Or the small skip gashes that are cut into the scenery as a cannon ball goes whizzing by.. Great stuff..  The level of care and detail there is pretty high..\n\nBut the AI is so dumb that the enemy unit of 120 line infantry will happily walk into a line of cannon..  Or horse melee units that charge into the barriers (only to die immediately in droves)..  Or how the diplomacy system is completely pointless..etc..\n\nThe AI is the killer.. It's just not good..\n\nOne way they got around that was to introduce the notion of \"drop in battles\" in which you can, during your single player campaign, enlist a friend (or complete stranger even) to play the part of the enemy during some of the battles.   I will admit.. This was a damn good and innovative idea.. Well done guys..  I love this..\n\nWhats nice about it is that the other player when he's playing your enemy, or when you're playing his enemy in his campaign, isn't really invested in the same way..  So if he loses it's almost like it's not a personal loss.. after all its not like you chose the force..etc..   I like it.. this was a good addition to the game..\n\nFor the next iteration of the game I hope they go more into the trading, and economy aspects of the game.   I want to be able to set individual tax rates for a single province.. or define whats being traded where..etc..  Right now its fairly limited.. you're either trading or not.. etc..  I know this game is more about the killin and less about things like trade and diplomacy but I still would like a more rounded game experience in these areas..\n\nAll in all... Not \"great\".. but pretty damn good and a lot of fun against like minded friends..\n\nAdditional;\n\nI really think Games Workshop should get with Creative Assembly and make Warhammer Total War.. Dear god.. talk about two franchises that absolutely belong together..  This engine, plus GW's IP?!  WIN!!  It would be like chocolate and peanut butter man..\n\nHow cool would it be to see a pack of Skaven march into a pack of Witchelves (dead Skaven)..  Or see a bunch of Jezzails take out some Coldone Knights.. etc..  Hot..\n\nI think this is such a good idea I'm going to send them a letter...\n","collection":"posts","url":"/game-review-napoleon-total-war/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2010-05-13-game-review-napoleon-total-war.md","collection":"posts","url":"/game-review-napoleon-total-war/","path":"_posts/2010-05-13-game-review-napoleon-total-war.md","id":"/game-review-napoleon-total-war","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Game Review: Napoleon Total War","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2010/05/napoleon-150x150.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":true,"allow_comments":false,"date":"2010-05-13 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"game-review-napoleon-total-war","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2010-06-29-fuck-you-citibank.md","content":"<img class=\"pull-right\" title=\"citibank_logo\" src=\"/images/2010/06/citibank_logo.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"320\" height=\"214\" />\n\nI have been a Citibank member for 15 years.  I got my first Citicard in 1995 while I was in the military after I got back from Korea because I figured it was time to go ahead and start working on my credit..\n\nI have always tried to keep a balance off of it, but there have been a couple  years where just due to the times I couldn't help but carry a small balance..\n\nWell the other day I went to pay off my card and I noticed that they bumped my APR to 29.998%...   Are you fucking kidding me?  30% APR is highway robbery..\n\nI called them up and asked them to lower my rate and they refused..  The operator I got ahold of (once I navigated their automated system) told me that \".. they were unable to lower my rate at this time.
