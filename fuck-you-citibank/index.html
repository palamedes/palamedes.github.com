<p>I have been a Citibank member for 15 years.  I got my first Citicard in 1995 while I was in the military after I got back from Korea because I figured it was time to go ahead and start working on my credit..</p>

<p>I have always tried to keep a balance off of it, but there have been a couple  years where just due to the times I couldn&#39;t help but carry a small balance..</p>

<p>Well the other day I went to pay off my card and I noticed that they bumped my APR to 29.998%...   Are you fucking kidding me?  30% APR is highway robbery..</p>

<p>I called them up and asked them to lower my rate and they refused..  The operator I got ahold of (once I navigated their automated system) told me that &quot;.. they were unable to lower my rate at this time. Thanks for calling.. <em>click</em>&quot;</p>

<p>I immediately called them back and told the new operator (that I got after navigating their automated system.. again) that I wanted to cancel my account and that it was due to their recent rate hike.. I have zero intention of paying 30% and that&#39;s ludicrous..   He said, &quot;but wait.. what if we lowered your APR would that make you stay?&quot;</p>

<p>I explained that the previous operator told me there was no way to lower my rate.. So I want to cancel the account.. (2)..  He came back explaining that he could lower my rate to 26% for 6 months.. (after which it would spring back to 30%)..  I said that this was a bunch of crap, that if this was such a deal why didn&#39;t the last guy offer it and that 26% is still robbery..  No thank you, I&#39;d like to cancel my account.. (3)..</p>

<p>&quot;But wouldn&#39;t you like to lower your rate?&quot; ..   I explained that if he could lower my rate to 0% I&#39;d stick around, otherwise, I&#39;d like to cancel my account.. (4)..  &quot;No you want to lower your rate, so that the remaining balance doesn&#39;t take that 30% rate, but instead gets this much lower rate... &quot;  (26% is &quot;much lower&quot;)..  I told him that I just paid the account off, online.. that there is no remaining balance and that I&#39;d like to cancel my account.. (5)..</p>

<p>But.. blah blah.. and blahdiddy blah..   I&#39;d like to cancel my account.. (6).. if you keep pestering me to lower my rate I will ask to speak to your manager..</p>

<p>&quot;Id be more than happy to let you speak to my manager..  but golly we need to lower this rate.. blah blah bullshit bullshit I&#39;m a douche blah blah blah&quot;..   I&#39;d like to cancel my fucking account please.. (7).. and now I want to speak to your manager..</p>

<p>I honestly was getting really pissed.. this asshat wouldn&#39;t let me just cancel the damn account..  I don&#39;t want it any more.. you&#39;re trying to screw me, and I refuse to do business with you..  Take your &quot;amazing low rate of 26%&quot; and shove it up your ass..  cancel my account.. I shouldn&#39;t have to ask for this 7+ times.. (I&#39;m sure it was more than 7.. this is very much the short version.. )</p>

<p>Eventually he asks me to hold (I fully expected him to just hang up the phone..)  A minute or so later someone got on the line claiming to be his manager and I told him that I wanted to cancel the account and that I shouldn&#39;t have to ask so many times, and that I shouldn&#39;t be pressured to do something I don&#39;t want to do.. I want to cancel the account.. Period.. I&#39;m done working with you..</p>

<p>He said, &quot;Fine it&#39;s canceled, do you want confirmation of the cancelation?&quot;  -- &quot;You&#39;re damn skippy.. &quot;  --  &quot;It will be sent to your billing address.. <em>click</em>&quot;</p>

<p>The manager was rude as hell..  I should never have had to deal with him.. The initial call taker should be fired to be honest.. Or retrained at best..</p>

<p>As to Citibank..  I&#39;m done with you..  Jack my rate to 30% which should be criminal, and then as of April 1st 2010, charge a $60 annual fee just to have the card?!   That&#39;s $60 a year, just to have that card empty in your wallet.  Are you kidding me?  This is some kind of joke right?</p>

<p>It&#39;s clear to me that Citibank doesn&#39;t give a rats ass about their members if this is the way they plan to treat us..   So fine.. Bye.. I&#39;m done with Citibank forever.. I wont do business with you ever again.. period.</p>

<p>More over I plan to tell as many people as possible not to do business with Citibank as they are clearly a bunch of crooks..</p>
