In CoD4, its used as an anti-personnel mine, as it should be.. but it has a minuscule range, and isn't very powerful.  If they wanted a small anti-personnel mine thats fine, but why besmirch the good name of the Claymore?\n\nEverything I have seen about the Claymore mine in modern day media is likely convincing kids all over the world that the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claymore_mine\" target=\"_blank\">M18A1 Claymore Mine</a> has 2 little lasers that shoot out to represent its firing arc, that all of them are self detonating and that right behind the claymore is a perfectly safe place to be -- wrong..\n\nWhile there are some mines that can be triggered by the mine itself, the vast majority of them are fired by an individual using the clacker (or rather, the M57 firing device.)   And they are absolutely devastating when they go off.\n\nWhile in the US Army, I got to see a Claymore mine detonated in person.  It was one of those US Weapons demonstrations that they do in basic training to get the soldiers pumped up, and let me tell ya -- the Claymore was damn impressive.   The drill sergeants had setup human silhouettes all around the claymore, front and back.  Those in front were about 150 feet away and those in back were about 50 feet away.\n\nWhen the drill finally pushed the plunger, the world moved.   A massive explosion took place and a huge cloud of dust and debris rained down..  The drill came walking up with a huge shit-eating grin and once the smoke cleared ALL of the silhouettes were gone.     We got to see them after wards too, no one would have lived.  Thats when it became clear to me that the Claymore mine was NOT compatible with life..\n\nThe Claymore mine fires 700 1/6th inch steel balls and uses the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misznay-Schardin_effect\" target=\"_blank\">Misznay-Schardin Effect</a> to spray those balls outward in a 60 degree arc in front of the mine. (Thus the iconic, \"FRONT TOWARDS ENEMY\").    Within that 60 degree arc it has an effective range of 65 to 100 feet, out of that 60 degree arc the range is less, but the mine is still quite effective and you're gonna have a bad day if you're closer to it than 50 feet.  I mean think about it, it has almost a full pound of c-4 explosive in it;  that will ruin anyones day.\n\nIn 1954 Picatinny Arsenal issued criteria that the claymore mine had to meet, they were as follows;\n\n* Must weigh less than 3 pounds.\n* Must throw enough fragments so that at a range of 55 yards (50 meters) it achieves a 100 percent strike rate on a 1.3 square feet target (in other words, it always must hit a person at 55 yards)\n* Fragment area must not be more than 8 feet high and no more than 60 degrees\n* Fragments must have a velocity of 4,000 feet per second of kinetic energy delivered to the target.\n\nThis means that if you're closer than 55 yards you're going to be hit by at least one if not more steel balls traveling at 3500+ feet per second..  That's just awful..  Not bad for a device that costs less than $200 each.\n\nI think it seriously down plays the effectiveness and devastation that a Claymore mine can put out when some game says it only has a range of 3 or 4 virtual feet and, oh you can live through it, and oh its safe to lay down behind it..\n\nYou can't live through it, they have a good long range, and it only takes one of those 700 ball bearings to kill you.\n\nYou certainly can't lay down behind it and be safe .. On the front it says \"FRONT TOWARDS ENEMY\", and on the back it says \"GET THE FUCK AWAY!!\".. er.. okay it just says \"BACK\", but maybe it should say more..\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2008-04-22-anyone-seen-my-hobby.md","url":"/anyone-seen-my-hobby/","relative_path":"_posts/2008-04-22-anyone-seen-my-hobby.md","id":"/anyone-seen-my-hobby","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Hobbies"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Anyone seen my hobby?!","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-04-22 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"anyone-seen-my-hobby","ext":".md"},"url":"/front-towards-enemy/","relative_path":"_posts/2008-05-14-front-towards-enemy.md","id":"/front-towards-enemy","collection":"posts","excerpt":"So, nothing bothers me more about Call of Duty 4 than how it and every other game, movie and .. media of choice .. misrepresent the Claymore mine.","draft":false,"categories":["Games","Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Front Towards Enemy!","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2008/06/claymore.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-05-14 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"front-towards-enemy","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2008-04-22-anyone-seen-my-hobby.md","output":null,"content":"I was asked the other day why I don't update my website more often..    A fine question, and I can only offer one answer..  I just don't want to..\n\nEr let me amend that..

And yet again people are yelling that video games are the problem!  What a complete crock of shit..

I have yet to kill anyone in real life because of some voices in my head spawned by the games that I play..  I'm pretty sure if I play the DVD backwards I wont find Satan's secret message (I think that would be giving EA or Activision too much credit..)  Just as I'm pretty sure playing a game wont make me want to murder someone or confuse my sense of right and wrong.\n\nWhat amazes me is the human beings inclination to lay blame.  Someone did something awful and we must immediately blame something or someone!   Of course, we can't blame the parents for their sloppy job, nor can we blame the individual that actually committed the crime -- no no, that would hit too close to home and imply that people are responsible for their actions..   We can't have that..  I mean thats just crazy talk.. No something else must be the cause, that way we can all go on and not take responsibility for any of our actions.\n\nClearly some influence in his life made him go out and kill people!   *gasp* He played a game once while listening to rap music while wearing his D&amp;D hat!\n\nIdiots.\n\nI'd love to see the comparison of the number of people killed by video games, rap music and D&amp;D combined, versus the number of people killed by religion.  That would be amusing, and yet wouldn't do a damn thing towards making these hypocrites shut the fuck up.\n\nThey always want to blame video games, music, D&amp;D, or some other activity rather than looking at the simple facts;\n\nThe individual was disturbed and had suicidal intentions -- period.  Often when someone is wanting to commit suicide they will go to extreme lengths to make sure that they go through with it.  In this case, it was to take a gun to school and shoot a bunch of classmates.  It sucks, it's awful, it happens.  It's no ones fault other than the individual that took the action.\n\nBlaming a video game, even an ultra violent one, for someones actions is as crazy as saying \"God made me do it!\"\n","previous":{"next":{"path":"_posts/2008-02-25-video-games-make-me-do-bad-things.md","url":"/video-games-make-me-do-bad-things/","relative_path":"_posts/2008-02-25-video-games-make-me-do-bad-things.md","id":"/video-games-make-me-do-bad-things","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Games","Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Video games make me do bad things!","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-02-25 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"video-games-make-me-do-bad-things","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2008-02-11-pc-gaming-is-dead.md","output":null,"content":"Sorry it's been a while since I posted, I've been very sick. This years flu has was nasty, and as such I was as sick as I have ever been.   It's been over two weeks and I'm still sniffly and coughing up gouts of lung butter..  Mmm Tasty..\n\nAs many of you know I play a lot of games.  Specifically PC games.  You name it and there is a good chance I have played it.  Lately it really does seem like games for the PC are starting to fail me.  Now, I don't think PC gaming is dead, I used that as a bait and switch.. but I do think its suffering right now and needs some serious help.\n\nThe majority of games for the PC have focused on one thing and one thing only, graphics!  The big developers seem to be of the opinion that the bigger and better the graphics the better the game!  They couldn't be more wrong.  Graphics don't make the game, in fact they can either help or hinder.  An extremely good game can be hindered by having stupidly high graphical requirements making the game unplayable by the masses.. thus it comes off as a failure.  See Crysis.\n\nThe most graphically impressive game engine of 2007 (and probably of all time) was the <a title=\"Crytek\" href=\"http://www.crytek.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Crytek</a> engine used in the game Crysis.  Easily.  When it comes right down to it, this engine should win all awards ~ when it comes to graphical kick-assery and go faster striping, this engine beats all.\n\nHaving said that, I can't wait for a good game to be made with it -- it will rock.  Which is to say, Crysis as a game was merely \"feh\".  I'm not going to go into all of it's failings but suffice it to say, I wasn't thoroughly impressed by the game.\n\nAnd I think I wasn't the only one. Its extremely high graphical requirements was a huge barrier to entry.  Add to that the lack-luster game play and you can see why they only sold around 86 thousand units in the US, making it a commercial failure.  It'd be interesting to see the numbers comparing cost of development versus profit.\n\nI really wish developers would stop trying to push the graphical envelop and actually focus on game play!  Game play is king!  If the game play sucks, then the graphics are wasted.   You can dress up \"suck\" all you want and in the end you just have pretty \"suck\".\n\nFor my money the best game of 2007 was <a href=\"http://www.whatistheorangebox.com/portal.html\" target=\"_blank\">Portal</a>.  Period.  (If you haven't at least tried it, you're wrong.)  This game had an extremely simple premise and it was quite enjoyable.  It's only failing, and I think everyone will agree, was that it was somewhat short.   This game goes a long way towards epitomizing my point though; game play &gt; graphics!\n\nWhile the HL2 engine can be ramped up to output some impressive stuff, they really didn't use any of that in Portal.  In fact they kept it down right plain to the point of sterility and incorporated that \"theme\" into the game.\n\nAnother game that is coming along nicely that I think promises to be good is <a href=\"http://www.battlefield-heroes.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Battlefield Heroes</a>.  I have been a long time fan of the <a href=\"http://www.battlefield.ea.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Battlefield franchise</a>, and still play <a href=\"http://www.battlefield.ea.com/battlefield/bf2142/\" target=\"_blank\">2142</a> quite a lot.  What DICE and EA are doing with Heroes seems clever to me and should go a long way in helping bring some gamers back to the PC.   This game really does seem to have the small game and the big game in mind.  Not only is it your standard first person shooter, but it seems like its going to have a bigger picture that is more \"Risk\" like.  Players will progress similar to the other Battlefield games but this time you do it with \"money\" earned  which allow you to buy prestige..etc..\n\nPlus they are applying some game techniques usually reserved for MMO's, and thats the ability to customize your toon.    Oh yes, its cartoony in nature.   A very stylistic game play reminiscent of  Valves Team Fortress 2, but they say not a direct clone and that they had actually designed their stuff prior to TF2 coming out.  *shrug*  okay.. Whatever.. I don't care if its a direct clone.. if its fun I'm for it.\n\nThe most amazing thing is that they are releasing the game for free!   Er.. wait.. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Arts\" target=\"_blank\">EA</a>?!  Free?!  Clearly <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Riccitiello\" target=\"_blank\">John Riccitiello</a> has gone insane and wants to go the way of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Probst\" target=\"_blank\">Probst</a>!  haha  Or he has given his underlings a freehand and they have had a stroke of genius.. Time will tell there..\n\nI mean it makes sense.. if you give something away for free, and its so good it brings people in.. you can market it in and monetize it in a dozen different ways.. *CoughGoogleCough*\n\nEither way I think its good!  I wish other game developers would take notice.\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2008-01-25-subluxation-a-chiropractic-crock-of-shit.md","url":"/subluxation-a-chiropractic-crock-of-shit/","relative_path":"_posts/2008-01-25-subluxation-a-chiropractic-crock-of-shit.md","id":"/subluxation-a-chiropractic-crock-of-shit","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Subluxation: A Chiropractic crock of shit!","layout":"post","tags":["Subluxation"],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":false,"date":"2008-01-25 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"subluxation-a-chiropractic-crock-of-shit","ext":".md"},"url":"/pc-gaming-is-dead/","relative_path":"_posts/2008-02-11-pc-gaming-is-dead.md","id":"/pc-gaming-is-dead","collection":"posts","excerpt":"As many of you know I play a lot of games.
