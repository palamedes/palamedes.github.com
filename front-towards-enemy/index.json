I'm a software guy -- having said that, sometimes I feel that I need to give a particular OS a nod -- and in this case, a piece of hardware too.\n\nI have 2 main computers that I use at home (beyond my work laptop, my home server and my firewall proxy box)..  One is my super uber game machine, and one is my catch all play around machine.   The game machine is a windows box because I don't have much choice -- you want to play games, you use windows.  Go Win-tendo!\n\nThe play machine was an Ubuntu box until last weekend when a thunderstorm killed it.   We have surge protectors on all our machines and a dedicated circuit for this part of the house, but for whatever reason this machine didn't weather the storm.  It was a very old machine and it had been rebuilt many times over so really it was due.\n\nSo, I figured it was time to get a new machine.  Originally I was going to get a \"shuttle\" machine which is a small PC but then someone else pointed out that the MacMini's are perfect for what I am wanting to do..\nI was intrigued.  Firstly, I wanted to do some iPhone SDK stuff and didn't have a mac, plus I wanted to get a small machine that wouldn't be the huge honkin box it was replacing.  The mini would be perfect!\nI figured what the hell and made the splurge.  It was only $600 after tax with my IBM discount so really I couldn't complain -- and let me tell ya, this little machine is great!\n\nI really haven't ever been a full time mac user, so I didn't really know what to expect.  Most of my mac experience comes from a machine I used for about a year back in 1994.. Quite a different animal, trust me.  Leopard is fantastic. It really is very simple and intuitive.  Plus now that it's just a BSD machine it is amazingly simple to get stuff working.\n\nMy very first challenge was to get Synergy up and running so I didn't need a keyboard/mouse attached to the box.  Yeah.. that took about 20 minutes.  The hard part was figuring out the \"launchd\" system which I wasn't used to.  But once I got that sorted out, it was cake!\n\nSo far everything just works.  It reminds me of Ubuntu in that way..  I really have to wonder how Windows is still around..  And you're reading the blog of a LONG TIME windows user.. I mean I went from Amiga to Windows 3.1..  I continued to use Windows NT long after it was popular to do so, and then used Win2k pro well beyond when XP was the standard..\n\nI can honestly say that at this point, I'll never go Vista.  Why would I?!  XP does everything I need for games, and for anything else I'll use linux or now Mac.  So far I'm very happy with the MacMini.\n\nI do have one complaint about the hardware: it comes with Wifi and frankly, it's not very good.  The mac mini wifi seems to drop it's connection or at least work intermittently at best, even when the receiver is less than 3 feet away.  I was pretty underwhelmed by that one aspect of the device.. Other than that its great!\n\nAnd I do have one complaint about the software:  the home and end key don't work the way I think they should and no amount of remapping or fixing seems to make them work like they do on the PC.  It's annoying.\n\nI would highly recommend it.\n","collection":"posts","url":"/im-a-software-guy/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2008-04-22-anyone-seen-my-hobby.md","collection":"posts","url":"/anyone-seen-my-hobby/","path":"_posts/2008-04-22-anyone-seen-my-hobby.md","id":"/anyone-seen-my-hobby","draft":false,"categories":["Hobbies"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Anyone seen my hobby?!","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-04-22 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"anyone-seen-my-hobby","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2008-04-16-im-a-software-guy.md","excerpt":"I have discovered as I have gotten older, and more experienced in the ways of computing that I just don't care what operating system I use.

I pride myself on beta testing just about every MMO that has ever been.. So I was a little sad when for whatever reason, the gods decided to not let me into the Age of Conan beta.  Eh, these things happen, however this meant I was pretty much slobbering at the bit waiting for access to the game. (I was one of the few that got into the paid early access for the game however, so that's close enough for me. )\n\nFirstly let me say, funcom has done a wonderful job capturing and portraying the world of Conan.. I'm having a lot of fun.\n\nHowever, I was initially worried.   I beta tested and played Anarchy Online and by all accounts it's initial release was a nightmare. It was truly, truly bad.  Funcom, and all other game companies for that matter, learned that day that to release a broken game dooms the game forever.  I had assumed that funcom learned its lesson and would release a stable game, in fact I had visions of board meetings in which the members all chanted, \"please not like AO\"... So you can imagine my shock when at 12pm my time, when the doors were to open.. Nothing happened.\n\nI refreshed the game a couple times and found out that it got pushed back to 3pm.  Fine fine.. understandable.. these things are complex..  So I played some Call of Duty 4 for a couple hours and dreamed of headchopping..   3pm came along and...   Nothing.  Plus, now the funcom forums have crashed due to a database error..\n\n\"Oh god..\" I cried, \"funcom is doing it again! Its Anarchy Online all over.. \"\n\nNow before you get disappointed, at 3:30pm the servers came online and I played for 12 hours straight.. but I get ahead of myself..\n\nAt this point the forums are coming up and down and having all manner of issues.  People are yammering away about lawsuits and making immature pointless complains.. (Seriously folks.. build a bridge and get over it.. )  Constant cries about how funcom has screwed the pooch!  About how players are going to sue, and about boycotting them, how this is the worse release ever (I WAY disagree)..etc.  (it was really lame.. I hope funcom knows that the vocal and annoying minority are just a bunch of douche bags that don't represent the rest of us.)\n\nThe game isn't actually to be released until the 20th.. so at this point the game isn't much more than a paid beta..  I'm not sure what people were/are complaining about.\n\nOnce the game did finally go live for those of us in the Early Access program at around 3:30 I jumped in and made 4 characters to get my commonly used names.  I then played the game as my ranger for the next 12 hours!\n\nSeriously.. 12 hours.. straight..   I got my character to level 17, and at around 4 am I went to bed..\n\nI had my graphics set to max and played without a hiccup or a glitch until around 6 hours in when my frame rate went into the toilet.   I relogged, and went right back at it. So they have a very minor memory leak most likely.. but hell if thats the worst of it.. YAY US!\n\nSeriously, what a fantastic game.  Funcom has done a marvelous job here folks.   Those who are saying this release was a bad one.. A) You're retarded -- the game isn't out yet.  That happens on the 20th in the US and the 23rd in Europe (Sucks.. sorry about that guys)..  B) this has been the cleanest deployment I've ever seen and I have played a lot of games of this nature.\n\nI think funcom has done a very good job.  Now I'll admit there is still ample time for them to screw it up between now and release, but so far so good.\n\n__Major game issues__:\n\n* In the 14 or so hours total that I have played the game at this point, I have only had one blue screen of death.  The game was running smoothly then the sound locks up, BSoD and auto-reboot.  No idea why it happened.  *shrug*  Could have been anything, so I am not even sure if it was the game.  It could have just as easily been the Microsoft auto updater which has caused me issues before and was demanding I install something upon reboot.\n\n__Minor game issues__:\n\n* After 8 hours of game play my frame rate tanked -- which of course just required me to re-log and all was well.  I class this as a minor issue because there was an easy fix.  Most likely it was a memory leak issue somewhere..\n* Climbing interface needs work -- you just kind of pop onto a ladder and then pop off of it.  Plus if you have multiple climbable surfaces near one another the game often gets confused as to which one you actually want to climb.\n* Mob AI is kinda weak -- when sneaking through the keep to steal the phoenix medallion often you must dispatch some troublesome guards.  Typically I wait for one to be alone, then kill him.  Wait for the next one to path along, then kill him.  Etc..  It amuses me that often one mob will path over the body of his fallen comrade without a care in the world.  I expect this behavour out of unintelligent mobs.. but not guards..\n* Grouping Colors -- by default player names are turned off..  To include those in your group!  I want to be able to see my group mates easily and can't do that in a pack of mobs.  Give us an option to show just our group mate names and make the icons for group members bigger on the mini map please.\n* First Person Shooting -- why does it take me from first person shooting to an over the shoulder view then back after combat?  this confuses me.. and frankly I hate it.\n* Range First/Third Person difference -- why does my bow have a different range depending on my view?  that's retarded.\n\nRequests:\n\n* I want a way to set a view preset for each of my weapon sets.  You have two weapon sets that you can swap between, I want my view to be able to swap too!  First person for bows, third person for swords.  Should be simple.\n* My bows range should be the same no matter what view I'm in.  Its really lame that they are different.  Both third person and first person should work as first person currently does.  If I miss, then I miss.  Don't tell me I'm out of range though.. thats really dumb.\n\nmore as I think of them...\n","collection":"posts","url":"/by-crom-its-age-of-conan/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2008-05-18-by-crom-its-age-of-conan.md","collection":"posts","url":"/by-crom-its-age-of-conan/","path":"_posts/2008-05-18-by-crom-its-age-of-conan.md","id":"/by-crom-its-age-of-conan","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"By Crom, it's Age of Conan!","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2008/06/age_of_conan_cover-150x150.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-05-18 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"by-crom-its-age-of-conan","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2008-06-02-its-been-a-year-already.md","content":"<a title=\"Same Cards!\" rel='lightbox' href='/images/2008/06/samecards.jpg' class='fancybox pull-right'><img src=\"/images/2008/06/samecards-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Same Cards!\" /></a>\n\nSo I can't believe I have been married for a year already! A whole year has gone by in the blink of an eye! It must be magic, cause it really went by fast and everything is still peachy.. More over, for our anniversary gifts to one another we both managed to get the same card, from different stores.. in different cities.. heh\n\nEither we are perfect for one another or both of these stores need a better stock of cards.. heh Considering the vast number that were at my store, I choose the \"we are perfect for one another\" option.\n\nFor our anniversary I got her dough nuts, and we had fishsticks.. Er.. okay kidding about the fishsticks.. Not the dough nuts.. heh.. It's sort of an inside joke, but the long and short of it is; we stayed up until 4am and I got up at 7am and got her her favorite dough nuts.. I was punch drink and woosey while driving the 30 minutes to and from the store..\n\nFor dinner we went to <a href=\"http://www.fogodechao.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Fogo de Chão</a> (fo-go dèe shoun) in downtown Austin.. This restaurant is fantastic! They stuff you full of meat, and then when you cant possibly hold any more, they shove in an extra hand full and call it \"dessert\". Seriously, the chef's walk around with large spits of meat and cut you off a slice as they walk by. It was great! Pricey as all hell, but damn good.\n\n<a title=\"Cheese Cake and Flan\" rel='lightbox' href='/images/2008/06/cheesecakeandflan.jpg' class='fancybox pull-left'><img src=\"/images/2008/06/cheesecakeandflan-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Cheese Cake and Flan\" /></a>\n\nAnd, whats more .. even with as much beef, lamb, chicken, and .. god any other animal you care to mention in our stomach's my lovely and skinny wife still managed to skoff down some cheesecake! I had the flan.. =) it was yummy.\n\nAfterwards Mel and I both had meat hangovers for a couple days.. heh\n","collection":"posts","url":"/its-been-a-year-already/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2008-06-12-3g-iphone.md","collection":"posts","url":"/3g-iphone/","path":"_posts/2008-06-12-3g-iphone.md","id":"/3g-iphone","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"3G iPhone","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2008/06/3giphone.png","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-06-12 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"3g-iphone","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2008-06-02-its-been-a-year-already.md","excerpt":"So I can't believe I have been married for a year already!
