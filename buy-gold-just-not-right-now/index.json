I have a nice piano so my investment there at this point would be only time, but I am not interested in it -- it still doesn't inspire me..  I still like the idea of the Chapman stick but the cost is just unreasonable and frankly the alternative is not as pretty (yes that matters) not to mention they have horrible business tactics which I don't appreciate..\n\nI thought about getting a guitar and may still do that as there's a ton of info out there for free as well as an awesome assortment of equipment.. So baring anything else.. I'll do that.. I can get a guitar on the cheap and I have 4 or 5 friends that have offered to loan me an instrument..\n\nHaving said that, of late a coworker of mine has gotten me interested in learning the violin or viola..   Plus I have done a lot of looking online and I have to admit they look fun..  The concept of an electric violin appeals to me.. hehe\n\nI think I like the sound of the viola more than that of the violin but it seems to me that everything out there is aimed more at teaching you the violin, and then you convert that knowledge to the viola or the cello..  As I understand it the knowledge transfers quit easily and I wouldn't be surprised if way back in history \"Violin\" translates to \"small Viola\".. heh\n\nWhat's really funny is I like the idea of an electric violin the most.. Primarily because I know its something that I could build..  I know.. whacky.. but I'm a damn good carpenter and frankly they don't look hard to build..  I have watched quite a few videos of them being made and to be honest, the only thing I need is the measurements..\n\nNot sure how the sound is picked up though -- it appears to be a crystal in the bridge which makes sense, since unlike an electric guitar there are no metal strings.. Beyond that making sure strings are correctly isolated and that the measurements are sound it seems easy..\n\nI'm not going to rush out of build one of course.. I mean if you can't play it what's the point..\n\nI have purchased several books and am reading up on the violin though as I think it's something I'd like to start doing.. I have wasted enough of my life sans music, it's time to start picking something up..  I found a place here in town that rents very nice violins for as low as $20-$30 a month and they have a looong list of instructors..\n\nI have told the wife of the plans and she seemed opened to it..  Good thing too as I'm sure for a while its going to sound like I'm torturing a cat to death..  I also have looked into various forms of \"muffles\" for violins so that I don't drive her completely insane..\n\nMore reading and video watching though to try to make sure it's what I want to do..\n\nOn a side note;  I have watched a lot of YouTube video's recently of people playing all manner of instruments and I'm just stunned and amazed at the varitey of talent there is out in the world..\n\nSome of you are fantastic!  Some.. not so much.. heh..  Gotta take the good with the bad I suppose..\n\nBut it just amazes me the number of people who record themselves performing their art for others to watch and even critique.. (though to be honest you're better off just closing the \"text comments\" and never ever reading them again.. It's also stunning how completely rude people are considering folks are opening themselves up to constructive comments, not unhelpful bad-mouthing by someone who couldn't even perform to the level they are bashing.)\n\nKelly Iverson (\"The Lady\") and Mark Allen (\"Doc Parsons\") are a fantastic example of people who love what they do and do it for our enjoyment.. they also show nicely that a well played guitar sounds wonderful with a well played violin.. Thanks guys, well done..\n*links removed*\n\nSome of the instruments are .. uh.. odd.. to say the least.. For example, the following is a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyckelharpa\" target=\"_blank\">nyckelharpa</a> and a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurdy_gurdy\" target=\"_blank\">hurdy gurdy</a> duo -- Stick around for the whole thing:\n*links removed*\n\nWasn't that great?!  I mean two instruments that absolutely fill the space with sound.. I'm not sure another instrument would fit in there.. heh\n\nI had never heard of a Nyckelharpa before but apparently it's a traditional Swedish instrument from the 14th century.. Very cool.. There are a lot of youtube videos of people playing them and they are neat..  The hurdy gurdy is I have heard before in person and you really can't appreciate it until you feel the buzz.. It's a wildly expressive instrument.. It's very cool that people not only still play these but are darn good at it..\n\nThere are a lot more examples too of folks willing to put themselves out there.. Kudos to you all.. Aint the internet cool.. =)\n","collection":"posts","url":"/play-the-radio-2/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2010-01-04-star-trek-online.md","collection":"posts","url":"/star-trek-online/","path":"_posts/2010-01-04-star-trek-online.md","id":"/star-trek-online","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Star Trek Online please don't be another Champions Online","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2010/01/sto.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2010-01-04 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"star-trek-online","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2009-12-09-play-the-radio-2.md","excerpt":"So I had said previously that my musical talent ended pretty much at the ability to play the radio, and that I hated that..  I wrote that entry back in July of '08 and I still hate it..","id":"/play-the-radio-2","draft":false,"categories":["Hobbies"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Play the radio 2","layout":"post","tags":["Music"],"image":"/images/2009/12/eviolin-150x150.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-12-09 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"play-the-radio-2","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2010-01-04-star-trek-online.md","content":"<img class=\"pull-right\" src=\"/images/2010/01/sto.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"210\" height=\"110\" />\n\nI have to admit that one of the games I am looking forward to in 2010 is Cryptic's, Star Trek Online.\n\nSome might wonder why the single most popular science fiction franchise in the history of media has taken so long to be turned into an MMO, myself included -- But I think it's a better use of our efforts to instead not speculate too much on the why of it but rather to channel that raw emotion and energy into the heart felt desire for STO to not suck.\n\nLet's be honest here, Cryptic Studios is very good at bringing out games that look kinda keen, but have zero long term playability.   City of Heroes and City of Villains suffered from this, and the successor Champions Online (City of Champions?) was even worse.   They looked great, but for whatever reason they just didn't have the sticking power to keep players interested.\n\nWill STO be the same thing?  Look good initially and maybe be fun for a week or two, but rapidly drag down into a grind-tastic mess?  God I hope not..\n\nI can't actually put my finger on what it is about CoH/CoV and CO that make them lose their fun.  I will say that of the three, I think City of Villains was the best with regards to game play but that was primarily due to the controller character architecture.  What can I say; I enjoyed having a pack of zombies at my disposal..\n\nGame play wise though, all of them got very boring and repeatative very very quickly.\n\nOne of the main cool points about the game was the ability to make all your characters 100% unique, but at the same time I can't help but wonder if that was part of it's downfall too..  When you look at games that have a more ridgid class structure you end up having a sort of community around that class, and with that community you have competition.  \"Oh yeah? Well I'm a better Warlock than you are.. and I'll prove it!!\"  etc..\n\nPlayers end up putting a lot of time and effort in to trying to make their cookie cutter class stand out from all the other cookie cutter classes.  That in and of itself forces a person to form a bond or an identity with their character making them want to keep playing..\n\nWhen you can start your characters virtual life as being 100% unique, you have one less thing to strive for..  So while it's really cool I can go out of my way to make my character look completely different.. it doesn't lend itself to longevity..\n\nThis also completely ruins the whole sense of community around a given class which is a problem.. What's more community is completely thrashed by the total lack of classes where group play happens..  The open architecture of characters, while initially cool, makes group forming painful because suddenly you can't say \"We need a healer\" and know that there are only 3 or 4 basic classes that heal..\n\nSTO appears to have classes with regards to ships; tanks, dps, and support ships.  So that's a damn good sign.  I'm hoping the realize the issues I described above and are working to correct the issue.. But I still have fears about the game as a whole..\n\nFor example; I absolutely cringe at the notion of wandering around a space station and having random NPC's run up and yell about how awesome I am like they did in CoH/CoV and CO..  Please rip that page out of the CoH/CoV/CO hand book and burn it..\n\nI also worry that the game's look (read: graphics) are dated even before the game has been released.  Cryptic has always intentionally made their games sort of \"middle of the road\" with regards to hardware requirements so it's very likely that the game will not be super high quality, but even so they screen shots look very lack-luster.   These could all be beta shots with poor textures or something, but I doubt it.\n\nI'm the first to admit that gameplay comes over graphics every time though, so if the game play is good then I can forgive just about any graphics decisions.. But then they aren't known for their game play so its easy to jump to conclusions..\n\nI guess my greatest fear is that Star Trek Online will end up being \"City of Star Trek\" and will be to Star Trek, what the original Star Wars MMO was to Star Wars.

Let people pick it up!   Most likely you've gotten all the early adopters you're going to get, now is the time to shuffle it out to the stores so the masses can get a hold of it.\n\nI think if the hold outs just got the device in their hands they'd see that the device itself is rock solid.  I love how everything just works.  Little things that were an issue with the iphone (granted it's a gen one iphone) this phone doesn't have.   Everything just works.\n\nStreaming Music from a site of my choosing ( <a href=\"http://di.fm/\" target=\"_blank\">http://di.fm</a> highly recommended ) ?  Yeah that works..  Streaming music that requires an authentication?  Yeah that works..  Straight to your A2DP stereo bluetooth headset?  yeah that works..  Put the phone down and leave it for 2 hours while you're doing something else.. come back and just poke play on your headset to resume?  Yeah.. that works too..   Been listening to some vocal trance the whole time I wrote this, and I've been wandering around the house a bit too..\n\nNone of that worked on my iphone.   And the bluetooth antenna rocks btw.. my iphone to headset pairing was weak and kinda crappy.. Not here -- the pairing is good and I have yet to have static or noise creep in unlike on the iphone.\n\nJust more examples of how good the hardware is.  I think google really was trying to build the cadillac of phones.    When ordering, I was concerned about the make of the product -- I was worried it would be flimsy or weak in some ways but its not at all.  The hardware feels solid though it does suffer the same \"greasy screen\" issues that all modern phones suffer.  I will say this for the iphone, it felt solid.  This phone feels the same way.  It's a teeny-tiny bit larger than the iphone so it doesn't fit in the belt case I like.. damn it.. heh but the weight is about the same.\n\nThe new OLED screen is amazing.  Sitting next to my iPhone at with the N1 at half brightness, its much brighter than the iphone.  In fact it makes the iphones screen look dull by comparison.\n\nI think android 2.1 works great, I have yet to run into any problems..  I have read that some people have found bugs but I haven't seen any..  Maybe I don't know what to look for.. I dunno.\n\nThe call quality is good and more importantly the audio levels are high enough I can hear in a noisy room.  One of my main complaints with my iphone was that if there was ANY ambient noise I simply couldn't hear someone on the phone, and the speaker phone was a joke.  The speaker phone on the Nexus still isn't as loud as I would like, but its far better than the iphone.    My Nokia Communicator had a GREAT speakerphone.. clearly phone makers need to contact the nokia folks and find out how its done..\n\nLike I keep saying.. it just works.. yay!\n\nIssues as I see them so far;\n\nGoogles grand plan is to change the face of the cell phone industry by offering a device that can doesn't limit you to a carrier.  Amen Brother.   But then they tether it to T-Mobile?  I can't help but think that this was a mistake.   In my opinion the number 1 killer of the iPhone was AT&amp;T.  Here in the Austin area the network is so saturated that it doesn't work.  AT&amp;T simply wasn't ready to handle the influx of customers that the iPhone generated.  T-Mobile (formerly VoiceStream) will suffer the same problem if the Nexus is even remotely as popular as the iphone was when it hit the market.\n\nI know they are releasing other versions of the phone to other carriers, but how does that change what we have today?  You're still locked to a network.   More over, even if you purchased the unlocked version of the phone you're still tied to one network due to 3G frequencies ..etc..  For example;  Right now this phone won't work with AT&amp;T's 3G network. Period.\n\nWe shall see..\n\nIt's still a new offering and I was a day one adopter so I don't know if this is a fair criticism on my part, but there are ZERO accessories for this sucker.  I know give it a month.. but still.  I want a stand.. some carrying case options.. some screen protection options..etc..\n\nWhat the hell is the point of the track ball?   I'm worried about the track ball popping out or in some way breaking.. It's the only part of the phone that concerns me because it kinda sticks out.    And it really seems to serve no purpose..   Again it's something that folks can use so we will likely see games that use it soon.\n\nI just had another complaint pop into and out of my head before I could write it down and now I can't remember what it was.. damn it..\n\nIt's not perfect.. but it's a wonderful device.\n\nI hate the question \"Is it the iphone killer\".. that's just a retarded question.. It's a damn good device, hows that?  I think for googles first try, its awesome and worth every penny.\n","collection":"posts","url":"/hardware-review-nexus-one/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2010-01-10-hardware-review-nexus-one.md","collection":"posts","url":"/hardware-review-nexus-one/","path":"_posts/2010-01-10-hardware-review-nexus-one.md","id":"/hardware-review-nexus-one","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Hardware Review: Nexus One","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2010/01/nexusone.png","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2010-01-10 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"hardware-review-nexus-one","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2010-01-18-game-review-star-trek-online.md","content":"<img class=\"pull-right\" title=\"Star Trek Online\" src=\"/images/2010/01/sto.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"210\" height=\"110\" />\n\nWhy I think they might actually have gotten it right.\n\nFirstly, I was really worried when I found out the end game for STO would be PVP-centric.  That just doesn't really work normally for any number of reasons which I wont go into just yet.. Traditionally if you look at all the major (even minor) MMO's out there that have tried, you'll see that they have generally failed or aren't entirely PVP based..   Eve Online being one that hasn't failed and does really well, but I believe that's largely due to being the only game in it's market.   By and large however, PVP only games just don't do that well with the masses..\n\nI believe that there are 4 primary reasons for PVP being problematic in most games:\n\n1.  PVP allows Player X to have an immediate and often negative impact on Player Y's game play experience.   This means that Player Y could possibly have his game play impacted by another player in such a way as to prevent him from enjoying or even advancing in the game.  Removing the \"fun\" from the game for Player Y entirely.\n\n2.  Good PVP and Smart PVP are two mutually exclusive concepts.  \"Good\" PVP is playing against another person where things are evenly matched in terms of player skills, character skills, gear, etc..  The fight is even odds and could go either way and as such, is a \"fair\" fight..   \"Smart\" PVP is employing any tactic that would give the player any form of advantage over the intended target -- fairness doesn't enter into it.   In fact the more unfair the fight is, the better.  Since most players always try to play smartly, the target of that doesn't have fun.\n\n3.  Everyone loses eventually, and most players lose most of the time.  This is simply math and has been proven time and again.  In any PVP engagement, you will eventually lose.  And most players, yes you too, lose most of the time.  It's a mathematical inevitability.  People don't like to lose as it's not fun.\n\n4.  Character skills and gear out weigh, player skills and gear every time.  In most PVP games it just about always pans out that the higher level and better equipped character will simply dominate the lower level character, regardless of the players skill or equipment. So no matter how awesome you are on your level 45 warlock, that level 50 paladin will simply slaughter you while watching TV and eating some pizza.. not fun.\n\nWhy are these things bad?  Well first of all you might have noticed I used \"fun\" in each point.  Games are first and foremost about fun.  If you aren't having fun then most likely you're not going to play very long.\n\nI think someone at cryptic looked at these facts and made the right decision to make PVP opt-in only.  Let's look at each issue in turn;\n\nThe first one can actually punish a player, just for playing the game. They might be having fun mining asteroids for example, wanting nothing to do with other people only to have their experience tainted by someone else..  I think most hard core PVP players completely miss the fact that what is fun for them, isn't the same thing as what's fun for everyone else and games are first and foremost about fun for everyone.  STO has made PVP an opt-in system so that you must knowingly go to the various PVP zones in order to do any form of PVP.  If you don't want to, you don't have to.\n\nThis opt-in methodology also largely solves the second issue. You can't be gate camped or ganked or griefed by a roaming pack of players in the regular world.. You must go into the PVP area where you acknowledge the possibility and most likely will bring your own posse..\n\nIf you know PVP is opt-in, then you wont mind losing on occasion.  STO makes the PVP very \"Zerg\" like in that if you do lose, you just respawn and off you go again.. So really dying a lot doesn't matter all that much. So who cares if you lose more than you win.. It's still fun!\n\nAnd so far the ship buffs/abilities and stats don't really seem to matter.   In my lowbie T1 Miranda class ship I was able to take out T2 ships in PVP.  I don't know if this was due to my better understanding of shield and power management or if my equipment was better or if I was a better player..  Or if I was just lucky!  But right now it seems like player skill actually matters a great deal more than everything else..\n\nI think it could work here..\n\nA lot of folks are bitching about not having open realm PVP though and those people irritate me..\n\nTheir primary complaint is that they should be able to attack any other player at any time.. And they always gloss it over with reasons why it would be canonically correct in a Star Trek universe..blah blah blah..\n\nLet's be clear;  the only people that would disagree with the opt-in PVP system are the PVP players who are the ones most offended by the notion that they some how do something \"unfair\" by attacking people that aren't as skilled, have no desire to participate, or who aren't in anyway ready for the PVP conflict they are suddenly thrust into without any option.   Simply put,  they are griefers who enjoy ruining other peoples game by taking out the easy target.\n\nI'm an old school PVP player from EVE online.  I have also PVP'd in EQ and WoW so I know where I'm coming from here.\n\nIn EVE when I went into a fight, I made damn sure it was going to be a fight I was going to win or at least had a good chance of winning.  If I didn't think it would go my way, I would unass the AO ASAP.\n\nIf I was going to steal jet can's (Yes I did that..) I made sure my target was someone I knew I could steal from without being instakilled.   When camping a gate in EVE I wouldn't do it alone, but rather would bring a whole crew -- why?  'cause I wanted to win!\n\nIt's just smart PVP -- don't engage in a fight you can't win.  The same notion is employed by modern day generals when waging war..  Don't play fair!!  Smart PVP will never be fair if the PVP'er knows what he is doing. A fair fight will get you killed every time.\n\nThere are a lot of players though who will never want to be apart of that world.. they want to play the game to have fun, and not PVP and they should be allowed to do so.   For them the fun is playing against the system and NPC's.. It's the same reason why raiding end game bosses in WoW and EQ is fun.. It's the challenge of beating the system..   Whether you, the hard core PVP'er, agree is completely immaterial.\n\nThus when you attack them unprovoked in systems that allow for that, they rightly call you a griefer because you're interrupting their fun.    I have griefed in my time, and been griefed.. so I understand..\n\nThe game designers in STO have rightly realized that it's an absolute imperitive to make the game fun for as many people as possible, and to do that PVP must be opt-in.  It's the only way to keep the largest portion of the population happy.\n\nThe simple fact of the matter is, if you attack someone who doesn't want to be attacked then you're negatively affecting their game play.  And the larger picture is;  Doing so will in many cases drive those players away from the game, which means now you're negatively affecting the developing studio's bottom line.  \"Carebears\", a term I hate, are by far the largest segment of the market and keeping them happy keeps the game afloat.\n\nKudos Cryptic.\n","collection":"posts","url":"/game-review-star-trek-online/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2010-01-19-game-review-star-trek-online-2.md","collection":"posts","url":"/game-review-star-trek-online-2/","path":"_posts/2010-01-19-game-review-star-trek-online-2.md","id":"/game-review-star-trek-online-2","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Game Review: Star Trek Online","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2010/01/Enterprise-150x150.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2010-01-19 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"game-review-star-trek-online-2","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2010-01-18-game-review-star-trek-online.md","excerpt":"Firstly, I was really worried when I found out the end game for STO would be PVP-centric.  That just doesn't really work normally for any number of reasons which I wont go into just yet..","id":"/game-review-star-trek-online","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"PVP and Star Trek Online","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2010/01/sto.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2010-01-18 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"game-review-star-trek-online","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2010-01-10-hardware-review-nexus-one.md","excerpt":"I was tired of my original iPhone and that would be getting the Sony Ericsson Xperia X10 when it came out some time later this year.   That was before I heard/read about Google's offering; the Nexus One.","id":"/hardware-review-nexus-one","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Hardware Review: Nexus One","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2010/01/nexusone.png","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2010-01-10 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"hardware-review-nexus-one","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2010-01-05-buy-gold-just-not-right-now.md","excerpt":"So there are a lot of people, some famous, trying to get you to buy gold..  While I was in the car dealership the other day in the waiting area they had the TV playing and there was something like 10 different gold resellers trying to convince us that NOW is the time to buy gold..","id":"/buy-gold-just-not-right-now","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Buy gold!!!
