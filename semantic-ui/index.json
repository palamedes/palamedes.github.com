I have the [MLT13 Clock](/scroll-saw-and-mlt-13-wooden-clock) up on the wall in my garage and it \"mostly\" works.  Seriously it's so close!  It just wont stay ticking, and then the move caused some of the joints to swell a little so it needs work.  (Humidity + Wood == Movement)\n\nThe issue with the MLT13 is that it was likely a bit more challenging than I realized and wasn't a good first clock project primarily because the escapement is fairly small.  I have recut the both the escape wheel and the pallets a number of times and still not gotten it 100% correct.  Either the tolerances are extremely tight or I just don't have a clue how to tune it.\n\nIt will \"tick\" for 5 or 6 seconds then stop with a bind in the escapement, or the escapement will spin free a couple times causing the pallets and excapement to get out of beat which throws everything off.. Either way, it's just off and I need to perfect an escapement if I am to have any hope of creating a working clock.\n\nSo to that end, my goal is to make just an escapement. A working demo that is just the \"heartbeat\" of a clock, with out all the extra stuff to tell time.  Baby steps.  This will be my minimum viable product and proof of concept, so-to-speak.\n\nI have researched all manner of different escapements and man there are a lot of them, but I knew I wanted an escapement that didn't necessarily require a hanging pendulum.  This narrowed down my list of options quite a bit and really left me with only one that I think will do the trick;  [The grasshopper escapement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grasshopper_escapement)\n\nIt looks very complex but it actually isn't that bad.  You can see how it moves in the gif.\n\nI started creating the escape gear below with the intent of making a 30 tooth escape wheel just like the gif had.. Took lots of measurements, made some plans, created a jig to help make my main escape gear and sure enough!  29 teeth... Damn it!  haha  Math is hard!\n\nAn unfortunate mistake but not an unrecoverable one.  Again this isn't supposed to be a working clock, just a working escapement.\n\nSo there ya go, the first two images are the jig and the finished glue-up without the covering wheel.\n\nTomorrow, I cut the various gear teeth down to size and shape them to look more like the gif.","collection":"posts","url":"/grasshopper-escapement/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2013-08-31-grasshopper-escapement.md","collection":"posts","url":"/grasshopper-escapement/","path":"_posts/2013-08-31-grasshopper-escapement.md","id":"/grasshopper-escapement","draft":false,"categories":["Hobbies"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Grasshopper Escapement","layout":"post","tags":["Wood Working","Clock"],"image":"/images/2013/08/grasshopper-escapement01.jpg","gallery":["/images/2013/08/grasshopper-escapement01.jpg","/images/2013/08/grasshopper-escapement02.jpg"],"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"tile_class":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2013-08-31 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"grasshopper-escapement","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2013-09-14-semantic-ui.md","content":"I have been a long time fan and user of [twitterbootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap).

It was a beautiful day and a nice trip.. I'd do it again..\n\nBrasstown bald is the highest natural point in the state of Georgia with a summit elevation of 4,784 feet above mean sea level.\n\nThe mountain is known to the native Cherokee people as Enotah.  It is named for the former Cherokee village of Brasstown, Georgia, located along the upper Brasstown Creek.\n\nAccording to the two Georgia historical markers, the area surrounding Brasstown Bald was settled by the Cherokee people. White settlers derived the word Brasstown from a translation error of a Cherokee word. Sounding very similar to another Cherokee word, settlers confused the word \"Itse'yĭ\" (New Green Place or Place of Fresh Green) with \"Ûňtsaiyĭ\" (Brass). Itse'yĭ, New Green Place, is a Cherokee locative name given to several distinct areas in the Cherokee world, including an area to the North of Brasstown Bald in North Georgia.\n\nCherokee legend tells of a great flood that swept over the land. Everyone that inhabited the land died except a few Cherokee families that sought refuge in a giant canoe. The canoe ran aground at the summit of the mountain. Having no wild game to hunt and no place to plant vegetation, the Great Spirit killed all of the trees on the top of the mountain so the surviving people could plant their crops. They continued planting until the water subsided.\n\nWhile the Cherokee legend tells of a treeless mountain top, the term \"bald\" is common mountain terminology describing mountaintops that have 360-degree unobstructed views. The official name that includes the word Bald in this case was not intended to suggest a once-treeless mountaintop, the way the term is used for most other Appalachian balds.\n\nOther names given to Brasstown Bald by the Cherokee: Echia, Echoee, Etchowee & Enotah.","collection":"posts","url":"/brasstown-bald/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2013-09-15-brasstown-bald.md","collection":"posts","url":"/brasstown-bald/","path":"_posts/2013-09-15-brasstown-bald.md","id":"/brasstown-bald","draft":false,"categories":["Photography"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Brasstown Bald, the highest natural point in Georgia.","layout":"post","tags":["Scenic"],"image":"/images/2013/09/brasstownbald035.jpg","gallery":["/images/2013/09/brasstownbald000.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald001.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald002.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald003.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald004.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald005.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald006.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald007.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald008.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald009.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald010.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald011.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald012.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald013.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald014.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald015.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald016.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald017.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald018.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald019.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald020.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald021.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald022.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald023.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald024.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald025.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald026.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald027.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald028.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald029.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald030.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald031.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald032.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald033.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald034.jpg"],"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"2x2","tile_color":null,"tile_class":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2013-09-15 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"brasstown-bald","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2013-12-06-price-of-software.md","content":"I don't work at a fast food restaurant, a pizza delivery joint, or behind the counter at a gas station.  In fact, I don't work at any job that is minimum wage or there abouts because in my opinion, it's not a livable wage.  And, to be completely honest, I don't understand how people manage to live on so little income.\n\nInstead, I chose a career path that requires a lot of technical knowledge and skill in order to stay competitive in the industry and that pays well enough that I can continue to live the lifestyle I enjoy.\n\nPart of my job is to entertain offers for work from prospective clients. This typically includes hours (often days) of communication, information gathering, research, and other unbillable time that I have to put in for them before I get paid a dime.\n\nThe ultimate goal of which is to divide up the work with the intent of putting hourly and iterative work totals to their software desire which gives them a cost estimate for the work they want done.   \n\nThis is the only part of my job I hate.  I hate it because all clients want the sky, the moon, and stars -- for free or very little money and scoff and demand to know why we are 'so expensive'.  \n\nWe aren't - In fact I know a lot of firms that charge a lot more than we do.  We are realistic.\n\nAn example prospective client hit us up today with a 20 page document (small type!) full of all the requirements that had to be met in order for us to be complete, had less than 3 months to do the work, and wanted the whole shebang for $10,000.   All the while bemoaning the previous developers that offered to do the work for that amount but who were unresponsive. \n\n(I will admit that having such thorough document to talk to is great!  Many clients show up with nothing but a dream only to have their hopes dashed when we start asking hard questions that they don't have answers to.  Define your product, or we can help you define it.  But if I define it, it will be an MVP/POC first and iterate into a full blown product.  This is a topic for a different post though.)\n\nBut the common thread is that no matter the scope of the work, they always think we are too expensive and quite often expect to pay less than half or even a quarter of what is reasonable. \n\nFor example; The $10k job above would have required at least two full time developers to get it done within the 3 month deadline, if it's even possible to make the deadline without working a lot of overtime.  But assuming its possible to get it done in the time allotted; $10k divided by roughly 60 days, at 8 hours a day, for 2 developers ends up being just above $10 an hour over the life of the project and that's before taxes.  \n\nNot a livable wage.  A plumber makes more.\n\nI didn't spend the last 20+ years getting experience in my industry and spending an unconscionable amount of extra time becoming an expert to work for so little. It requires a lot of time, effort and energy on my part to stay current and competitive in my industry so I have very little patience with people who think I get paid too much money for what I do. \n\nSorry, but anyone who says software engineers and architects get paid too much, don't understand what it takes to do what we do.\n\nI think the issue is most people just see the initial number and think its a lot.   On the surface, $10k is a lot of money.  And if I were given $10k for doing nothing then I'd be happy as a clam.\n\nMost people have no concept the amount of work, time, and effort that goes into writing software and as such they can't really fathom it.  Because they can't wrap their mind around it and because there is nothing physical to put value to, it's very easy to think that they are paying us that $10k for nothing and that we should be just happy as a clam for being offered it.\n\nIt pains me to have to be the one to explain to them that this isn't the case.  The problem comes when you have those people that are actually offended by the amount I say it would actually require in order to pull their dream off.   I'm usually looked at as a greedy bastard and thought of as a criminal.\n\nMost firms would charge closer to $100k for that 3 month job.  See what I mean?  You scoffed a little didn't you.\n\nAnd I'm just talking about the initial development cost.  Not maintenance fees, server hardware, data storage fees, design costs, testing costs etc..  \n\nThe problem with going with the $10k firm versus the $100k firm is that you get what you pay for.  The perceived value is in dollars only, without any thought or consideration to the quality of the work being done or the support you're going to get before start, during development and after completion.  (We give 6 months of bugfixes for free.)\n\nThey have already approached $10k firm for the product and they don't like the support / communication they were getting (read: the firm has just disappeared because 10k for this project is too low), so why are they looking for another $10k firm that will likely give them the exact same results?  \n\nYou get what you pay for and people some how refuse to learn that lesson with software.  \n\n\n\n\n\n","collection":"posts","url":"/price-of-software/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2013-12-10-state-of-industry.md","collection":"posts","url":"/state-of-industry/","path":"_posts/2013-12-10-state-of-industry.md","id":"/state-of-industry","draft":false,"categories":["Software Development"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"State of the Industry Concerns","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2013/12/cliff.jpg","gallery":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"tile_class":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2013-12-10 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"state-of-industry","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2013-12-06-price-of-software.md","excerpt":"You get what you pay for and people some how refuse to learn that lesson with software.","id":"/price-of-software","draft":false,"categories":["Software Development"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Software Development Costs","layout":"post","tags":["Costs"],"image":"/images/2013/12/software-development-costs.jpg","gallery":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"tile_class":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2013-12-06 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"price-of-software","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2013-09-15-brasstown-bald.md","excerpt":"Brasstown bald is the highest natural point in the state of Georgia with a summit elevation of 4,784 feet above mean sea level .. and we hiked up it.","id":"/brasstown-bald","draft":false,"categories":["Photography"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Brasstown Bald, the highest natural point in Georgia.","layout":"post","tags":["Scenic"],"image":"/images/2013/09/brasstownbald035.jpg","gallery":["/images/2013/09/brasstownbald000.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald001.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald002.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald003.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald004.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald005.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald006.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald007.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald008.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald009.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald010.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald011.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald012.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald013.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald014.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald015.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald016.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald017.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald018.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald019.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald020.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald021.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald022.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald023.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald024.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald025.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald026.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald027.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald028.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald029.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald030.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald031.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald032.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald033.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald034.jpg"],"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"2x2","tile_color":null,"tile_class":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2013-09-15 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"brasstown-bald","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2013-09-14-semantic-ui.md","excerpt":"It's time to remove the often obtuse vocabulary overhead required by certain UI frameworks","id":"/semantic-ui","draft":false,"categories":["Software Development"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Semantic UI","layout":"post","tags":["UX"],"image":"/images/2013/09/semanticui01.jpg","gallery":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"tile_class":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2013-09-14 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"semantic-ui","ext":".md"}
