It was quite possibly one of the best 3 hour games I have ever played.. I mean, it was absolutely genius..  It a first person physics puzzle that walked this amazingly fine line of comedic darkness that kept you thinking, and laughing..\n\nThe only negative feedback anyone ever was able to come up with was how short it was.. When I say its a 3 hour game.. I mean it, it's a 3 hour game..  Even going slow you should be able to solve it in that amount of time..  You can eek out a couple extra hours of fun by doing the bonus levels or trying to get all the achievements but that's really it..\n\nThat was a tad disappointing, but Valve knew they were on to something and started working on the next installment almost immediately..\n\nAnd I have to say, holy crap.. it looks amazing..  Check out all the videos over at <a href=\"http://thinkwithportals.com/\" target=\"_blank\">http://thinkwithportals.com/</a>\n\nI couldn't help but sit here giggling with the pure liquid awesomeness that is the coming game.. It looks so good!   I got so excited I played through the first game again..\n\nAnd btw, if you haven't played Portal yet.. You should.. It costs $19 on Steam and is worth every penny!  yes it's only a 3 hour game, but still it's so fun you'll likely play it several times..

Martin has done a masterful job of creating an extremely suspenseful story full of political intrigue, action and hard core drama.\n\nOriginally released back in 1997 I some how missed this story until now..  At this point, it includes 4 books and I'm part way through the second one.. So far it appears to be a fantastic continuation of the first book beginning exactly where the first book left off as if it were one long book.. Yay!   It's good.. It's damn good..  The authors voice and the depth of the characters make it so..\n\nI highly recommend it.  <a href=\"http://search.barnesandnoble.com/A-Game-of-Thrones/George-R-R-Martin/e/9780553573404/?itm=2&amp;USRI=game+of+thrones#TABS\" target=\"_blank\">Clickie to Barnes and Nobles</a>\n\nAt this point I have only one complaint, and that's the eReader version appears to have a lot of typos.. Some are quite jarring.. But you can easily ignore them.. Or if you get the paper/hard back you wont have this problem..\n\n5/5 from me.. Good work George..\n\nApparently they are making the series into an HBO special in 2011..  It better be good!\n","previous":{"next":{"path":"_posts/2010-09-26-book-review-a-game-of-thrones.md","url":"/book-review-a-game-of-thrones/","relative_path":"_posts/2010-09-26-book-review-a-game-of-thrones.md","id":"/book-review-a-game-of-thrones","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Book Review: A Game of Thrones","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2010/09/30652075.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2010-09-26 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"book-review-a-game-of-thrones","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2010-09-15-i-hate-people.md","output":null,"content":"<a href=\"/images/2010/09/internet_dickwad_theory.gif\" class='pull-right'><img title=\"internet_dickwad_theory\" src=\"/images/2010/09/internet_dickwad_theory.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"250\" /></a>Seriously..  I hate people..\n\nI play a lot of online games, and that means I'm forced to interact with the greater online gaming community and thus anonymous asshats on the internet..  And no matter which game I play, people seem to think its perfectly okay to act as big an asshole as humanly possible.\n\nMy current online game of choice is <a href=\"http://www.leagueoflegends.com/\" target=\"_blank\">League of Legends</a>.   A great game with only one serious flaw; other people.  Actually I take that back, if they would just remove the chat system entirely the game would rock..\n\nThey have a chat system where by a team can talk to one another and form strategies and use tactics to overwhelm ...er..

You guys ROCK!   Even if the end product is only so so, it still will go a really long way towards a musical reawakening..  I can't wait!!\n\nThis \"game\" will be the next hot ticket you watch.. I put game in quotes because this sucker is transcending game, and becoming something much more..  I really believe everyone will buy this thing, and it will sell like crazy cause suddenly not only will video game enthusiasts buy it for the pure fun of it, but would-be musicians and music teachers alike will use it as a training tool!!!  Awesome sauce.. They just doubled their potential user base..  Probably more really..\n\nMy only concern at this point is screen real estate..  Now they have Vocals, Guitar, Bass, Drums and Keyboard...  Going to be darn hard to fit much more in there unless they start having guitar and bass share a single track or something.. (totally doable..)\n\nI also seriously hope they have a pro-piano mode like the pro-guitar mode promised..   I have a full sized Yamaha keyboard (<a href=\"/play-the-radio/\">that I have talked about before</a>) with midi that is just beginning me to play it..  Either way I'll get to learn to play a guitar one way or the other and have fun doing it..  Just awesome..\n\nI'm so stoked.. I can't wait to get my hands on this and begin learning..  Thanks Harmonix.\n","previous":{"next":{"path":"_posts/2010-09-14-rockband-3.md","url":"/rockband-3/","relative_path":"_posts/2010-09-14-rockband-3.md","id":"/rockband-3","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Rockband 3.. *Gleeeee*","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2010/09/rb3-pro-trainer-hed-rm-eng.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2010-09-14 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"rockband-3","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2010-09-14-i-kill-harddrives.md","output":null,"content":"<img class=\"pull-right\" title=\"hard-drive Logo\" src=\"/images/2010/09/hard-drive-Logo-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" />\n        \nSeriously!  This is starting to annoy me.  I swear every 5 or 6 months, I have another dead harddrive. It's not like I hate them or anything. I just can't keep them alive.  It's almost like my house is where HD's go to die.\n\nLast night I had yet another one bite the dust.  Thankfully it was my secondary game drive, not my primary OS drive.  I have learned to make my primary OS drive a SSD, they seem to last longer.\n\nI'm likely going to go get another SSD today as my new game drive.  I'm just tired of the 1950's technology that is HD's failing on me.\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2010-08-13-earth-to-jason.md","url":"/earth-to-jason/","relative_path":"_posts/2010-08-13-earth-to-jason.md","id":"/earth-to-jason","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Earth to jason...","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2010-08-13 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"earth-to-jason","ext":".md"},"url":"/i-kill-harddrives/","relative_path":"_posts/2010-09-14-i-kill-harddrives.md","id":"/i-kill-harddrives","collection":"posts","excerpt":"I swear every 5 or 6 months, I have another dead harddrive.
