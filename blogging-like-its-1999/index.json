More than anything I'm learning about Ruby and programming in the Ruby on rails environment. I'm sure once all is said and done all have a decent product to share with the world, but it still just too early to release. (Even though you can actually get it online right now it might github account -- I would avoid doing so for the time being.)\n\nI've actually made a couple posts on my new blogging system, and those will become available once my blogging system goes live but I haven't bothered import them into WordPress yet and probably won't.\n\nMelissa and I are still very much wanting to move out of Texas and go to someplace like Tennessee or Georgia. We've been doing a lot of research and have some areas in mind; right now were looking at Blue Ridge Georgia. It's a very beautiful area with a lot of resort like cabins and whatnot and I honestly can't wait to live there. However, we have to wait for David weekly to get off their ass and actually correct what's wrong with our house --  We are still fighting that seven-year long fight with them regarding our foundation issues. It's an endless battle and to be honest I'm really tired of it -- I just want it all to go away.\n\nBut towards that end, we started cleaning up the house and started moving things out that we don't want here when we do show the house.  Here soon I will contact a couple different realtors and have them come out and tell us what we need to do in order to proceed. here today or tomorrow, I'm going to get a storage unit so that the decrapification of the house may continue.\n\nI'm trying to think of what else is going on.\n\nI'm starting to get that really weird foot pain again. I have those orthotics that the doctor gave me but to be honest those damn things hurt me more then not wearing them. I think ultimately I just need some new shoes, my tennis shoes are really rather old at this point.\n\nSome friends and I are looking at creating our own little video/audio blogging podcast around the programming we do in projects that we want to participate in. More than anything it's going to be four guys talking to one another just, fucking around but it's going be a lot of fun. I doubt anyone will seriously watch it, more than anything is just a fun way for us to keep in touch and goof off. But to that end I went ahead and purchased a really nice podcasting microphone. I have it hooked up on a boom mic stand and everything so that it sticks right in front of my mouth and can easily be pushed out of the way when I don't need it.\n\nSo for grins I went ahead and got a copy of Dragon natural speaking so that I can do some dictation. I figure that if I'm going to get this really nice microphone and get it set up to do this podcasting thing I might as well kill two birds with one stone and get the dictation software that I've always wanted to try so that I can give it a whack.\n\nI have to admit I'm really rather impressed; Dragon NaturallySpeaking is really fucking cool. Everything you see in this post was actually dictated directly from word-of-mouth to the WordPress text box with very little editing done post process. (it just wouldn't recognize \"decrapification\" since it's not a real word and I'm still trying to figure out how to train that word in.. heh)\n\nI knew that there was a lot of really good dictation software out there but I had no concept that it was this good.\n\nThe other nice thing about this dictation solution is that it will likely encourage me to create more posts and updates.\n\nAnyway that's all for now I'll try to be better about updating sorry took so long -- not that anyone actually reads this.. I have to admit this stuff is more for me than anyone else.\n","collection":"posts","url":"/wow-its-really-been-a-while/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2012-11-07-electoral-college-versus-popular-vote.md","collection":"posts","url":"/electoral-college-versus-popular-vote/","path":"_posts/2012-11-07-electoral-college-versus-popular-vote.md","id":"/electoral-college-versus-popular-vote","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"layout":"post","title":"Electoral college versus popular vote","tags":["Voting"],"published":true,"type":"post","ribbon":null,"image":"/images/2013/01/electoralvote.jpg","gallery":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2012-11-07 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"electoral-college-versus-popular-vote","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2012-11-05-wow-its-really-been-a-while.md","excerpt":"Hey guys, I'm went dark for quite some time apparently and I didn't really mean to let this much time passed since my last post..","id":"/wow-its-really-been-a-while","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"layout":"post","title":"wow it's really been a while","tags":[],"published":true,"type":"post","image":"/images/2013/01/beenawhile.jpg","gallery":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2012-11-05 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"wow-its-really-been-a-while","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2012-11-07-electoral-college-versus-popular-vote.md","content":"So, with the 2012 presidential election finally over, I'd like to discuss some of the things that I saw during the whole shebang.\n\nI noticed at one point during the process Mitt Romney had more popular vote than Barack Obama but at the same time Barack Obama had more electoral votes  which made me wonder if the popular vote actually matters at all.\n\nI did a bunch of research that harkens back to my 20 plus years ago social study courses because I simply didn't remember the purpose of the electoral college with regards to the popular vote.\n\nThe electoral college was implemented in order to represent the population of a given state before people could travel to the election sites and actually cast ballots. Way back then it took several days if not longer to travel all those distances and so quite often votes weren't being made at all. The electoral college system changed all that and allowed people to have a voice even when they weren't able to directly cast a ballot. It's very much a winner take all system, so in one sense the general election popular vote does not matter when you consider the country as a whole.\n\nWhere it does matter is at a state level; As a rule of thumb, the electoral college will award the winner of your states popular vote all of the state's electoral votes. And, the winner of the most electoral votes wins the general election.\n\nThe use of the electoral college system is a debatable issue at this point in history it gives and takes. On the one hand, it makes dissenting votes in a non-swing state meaningless. For example, if your state is heavily Democratic, your vote for Republican party member (while it still technically counts) really has no impact on the election as a whole.\n\nOn the other hand, it prevents grossly overpopulated states from having total control of the election. Without the electoral college vote system in place and if the popular vote was all that counted, states like California, New York, Illinois and Georgia would have a huge influence on the election while entire states like Iowa or Alaska (which are very lightly populated by comparison) would not have any significance in the election at all.\n\nWhat I find interesting is, I believe the electoral college system actually encourages people to not vote. Under the electoral college system, if you know your state is primarily Democratic or primarily Republican and you tend to vote the same way then you don't actually have to vote because really your vote won't count towards the popular vote of any other state and if your state votes your way already why bother taking the trip in the first place.\n\nOn the other hand, if your state primarily votes one way and you vote the other, then the electoral college system can be seen as a form of oppression or even tyranny of the masses because no amount of voting will actually make any difference -- so again why bother?\n\nI think at one time the electoral college system was really a good thing, but I'm not sure it is any more. Maybe it's something of a bygone age that needs to be reconsidered in this modern time of fast cars, internet and ultra connectivity. I think the original intention was good but is it still relevant?\n\nLet's take a vote...\n","collection":"posts","url":"/electoral-college-versus-popular-vote/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2012-11-07-electoral-college-versus-popular-vote.md","collection":"posts","url":"/electoral-college-versus-popular-vote/","path":"_posts/2012-11-07-electoral-college-versus-popular-vote.md","id":"/electoral-college-versus-popular-vote","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"layout":"post","title":"Electoral college versus popular vote","tags":["Voting"],"published":true,"type":"post","ribbon":null,"image":"/images/2013/01/electoralvote.jpg","gallery":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2012-11-07 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"electoral-college-versus-popular-vote","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2013-02-01-blogging-like-its-1999.md","content":"I have been working on and off on the new personal blogging solution that I wanted to use as a replacement for wordpress for quite some time now and not really making a lot of headway just due to the scope of the project I had set for myself..

When I was in the military in 1991 I had an opportunity through the USO to take advantage of a small flight training program where I got to spend some time in the little Cessna 152 & tool around the airports in the Bay Area in California and it was a wonderful experience.\n\nUnfortunately I could not afford it.. Anyone who lives in the military or is in the military knows that your privates and PFCs and what not -- they just don't get paid very much and I was no exception, I did not get very much money.\n\nSo ultimately when it came down to pursuing this past time it was kind of a dream; it's  something that I wanted to do, I was desperate to do it but I just couldn't afford it.  There was no way for me to make it happen.\n\nWhile now, set the way forward machine to 30 years later, (er 20 years later sorry terrible math) and I kind of have an opportunity to do it and I also have the income and desire.\n\nSo, I figured what the hell this is something that I would like to go ahead and start doing.  So I have been shopping around online looking for potential flight schools and just get a feeling for what I need to know.  I've also purchased some books from smarties or sorry, sporty's rather, so I can look it you may be doing some training ground school training outside the classrooms so I don't have to pay somebody else --  if nothing else it will be a refresher.\n\nThere is nothing  there is no competing with an actual teacher so having an instructor there will invalueable but maybe going into the classroom with a little bit of education under your belt, that that's not a bad thing so I figure that's 200 dollars well spent.\n And I'll read those videos er read those booklets and watch the videos thoroughly before I go but I have to admit one of the things that really made me want to do this was I was browsing online for just different planes and I mean just looking.. I wasn't really shopping per se I was just looking to see what kind of cool planes were out there lately and I.. I fell in love.. found a plane that I think is just beautiful.\n\nThat's the Diamond DA42 Twinstar, it is it is a sexy sexy plane.\n\nWhat a wonderful looking machine and and I've watched many videos on YouTube and and reviews and it's amazing to me how far the technology has come and the full glass cockpit that those long sweeping wings it almost looks like a glider.  The diesel engines, diesel engines! No kidding and I just,  it's amazing machine and I got to be honest with you...\n\nI want one of those. It's a $650,000 airplane. It's not very likely that I'll get one anytime soon.. (taking donations by the way .. kidding) but uh so yeah, there ya go.   It's something I've always wanted to do, something I'm very keen on and I think I want to go forward.  So I'll keep you posted. I'll let ya know..","collection":"posts","url":"/i-want-to-fly/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2013-02-27-i-want-to-fly.md","collection":"posts","url":"/i-want-to-fly/","path":"_posts/2013-02-27-i-want-to-fly.md","id":"/i-want-to-fly","draft":false,"categories":["Aviation","Hobbies"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"So, I think I want to fly..","layout":"post","tags":["General Aviation"],"image":"/images/2013/02/da42-01.jpg","gallery":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"2x2","private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2013-02-27 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"i-want-to-fly","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2013-04-02-google-chrome-reload-options.md","content":"<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2013/04/google-chrome-hard-refresh.png\" class=\"pull-right fancybox\"><img title=\"Google Chrome refresh options\" src=\"/images/2013/04/google-chrome-hard-refresh.png\" alt=\"Google Chrome refresh options\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Google Chrome Refresh Options</span></a>\n\nThis will be quick;  Over the years I have used a lot of different browser to do my web development, but once google chrome came out it sorta dominated my destiny.
