I pride myself on beta testing just about every MMO that has ever been.. So I was a little sad when for whatever reason, the gods decided to not let me into the Age of Conan beta.  Eh, these things happen, however this meant I was pretty much slobbering at the bit waiting for access to the game. (I was one of the few that got into the paid early access for the game however, so that's close enough for me. )\n\nFirstly let me say, funcom has done a wonderful job capturing and portraying the world of Conan.. I'm having a lot of fun.\n\nHowever, I was initially worried.   I beta tested and played Anarchy Online and by all accounts it's initial release was a nightmare. It was truly, truly bad.  Funcom, and all other game companies for that matter, learned that day that to release a broken game dooms the game forever.  I had assumed that funcom learned its lesson and would release a stable game, in fact I had visions of board meetings in which the members all chanted, \"please not like AO\"... So you can imagine my shock when at 12pm my time, when the doors were to open.. Nothing happened.\n\nI refreshed the game a couple times and found out that it got pushed back to 3pm.  Fine fine.. understandable.. these things are complex..  So I played some Call of Duty 4 for a couple hours and dreamed of headchopping..   3pm came along and...   Nothing.  Plus, now the funcom forums have crashed due to a database error..\n\n\"Oh god..\" I cried, \"funcom is doing it again! Its Anarchy Online all over.. \"\n\nNow before you get disappointed, at 3:30pm the servers came online and I played for 12 hours straight.. but I get ahead of myself..\n\nAt this point the forums are coming up and down and having all manner of issues.  People are yammering away about lawsuits and making immature pointless complains.. (Seriously folks.. build a bridge and get over it.. )  Constant cries about how funcom has screwed the pooch!  About how players are going to sue, and about boycotting them, how this is the worse release ever (I WAY disagree)..etc.  (it was really lame.. I hope funcom knows that the vocal and annoying minority are just a bunch of douche bags that don't represent the rest of us.)\n\nThe game isn't actually to be released until the 20th.. so at this point the game isn't much more than a paid beta..  I'm not sure what people were/are complaining about.\n\nOnce the game did finally go live for those of us in the Early Access program at around 3:30 I jumped in and made 4 characters to get my commonly used names.  I then played the game as my ranger for the next 12 hours!\n\nSeriously.. 12 hours.. straight..   I got my character to level 17, and at around 4 am I went to bed..\n\nI had my graphics set to max and played without a hiccup or a glitch until around 6 hours in when my frame rate went into the toilet.   I relogged, and went right back at it. So they have a very minor memory leak most likely.. but hell if thats the worst of it.. YAY US!\n\nSeriously, what a fantastic game.  Funcom has done a marvelous job here folks.   Those who are saying this release was a bad one.. A) You're retarded -- the game isn't out yet.  That happens on the 20th in the US and the 23rd in Europe (Sucks.. sorry about that guys)..  B) this has been the cleanest deployment I've ever seen and I have played a lot of games of this nature.\n\nI think funcom has done a very good job.  Now I'll admit there is still ample time for them to screw it up between now and release, but so far so good.\n\n__Major game issues__:\n\n* In the 14 or so hours total that I have played the game at this point, I have only had one blue screen of death.  The game was running smoothly then the sound locks up, BSoD and auto-reboot.  No idea why it happened.  *shrug*  Could have been anything, so I am not even sure if it was the game.  It could have just as easily been the Microsoft auto updater which has caused me issues before and was demanding I install something upon reboot.\n\n__Minor game issues__:\n\n* After 8 hours of game play my frame rate tanked -- which of course just required me to re-log and all was well.  I class this as a minor issue because there was an easy fix.  Most likely it was a memory leak issue somewhere..\n* Climbing interface needs work -- you just kind of pop onto a ladder and then pop off of it.  Plus if you have multiple climbable surfaces near one another the game often gets confused as to which one you actually want to climb.\n* Mob AI is kinda weak -- when sneaking through the keep to steal the phoenix medallion often you must dispatch some troublesome guards.  Typically I wait for one to be alone, then kill him.  Wait for the next one to path along, then kill him.  Etc..  It amuses me that often one mob will path over the body of his fallen comrade without a care in the world.  I expect this behavour out of unintelligent mobs.. but not guards..\n* Grouping Colors -- by default player names are turned off..  To include those in your group!  I want to be able to see my group mates easily and can't do that in a pack of mobs.  Give us an option to show just our group mate names and make the icons for group members bigger on the mini map please.\n* First Person Shooting -- why does it take me from first person shooting to an over the shoulder view then back after combat?  this confuses me.. and frankly I hate it.\n* Range First/Third Person difference -- why does my bow have a different range depending on my view?  that's retarded.\n\nRequests:\n\n* I want a way to set a view preset for each of my weapon sets.  You have two weapon sets that you can swap between, I want my view to be able to swap too!  First person for bows, third person for swords.  Should be simple.\n* My bows range should be the same no matter what view I'm in.  Its really lame that they are different.  Both third person and first person should work as first person currently does.  If I miss, then I miss.  Don't tell me I'm out of range though.. thats really dumb.\n\nmore as I think of them...\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2008-05-14-front-towards-enemy.md","url":"/front-towards-enemy/","relative_path":"_posts/2008-05-14-front-towards-enemy.md","id":"/front-towards-enemy","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Games","Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Front Towards Enemy!","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2008/06/claymore.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-05-14 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"front-towards-enemy","ext":".md"},"url":"/by-crom-its-age-of-conan/","relative_path":"_posts/2008-05-18-by-crom-its-age-of-conan.md","id":"/by-crom-its-age-of-conan","collection":"posts","excerpt":"It's interesting..

In CoD4, its used as an anti-personnel mine, as it should be.. but it has a minuscule range, and isn't very powerful.  If they wanted a small anti-personnel mine thats fine, but why besmirch the good name of the Claymore?\n\nEverything I have seen about the Claymore mine in modern day media is likely convincing kids all over the world that the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claymore_mine\" target=\"_blank\">M18A1 Claymore Mine</a> has 2 little lasers that shoot out to represent its firing arc, that all of them are self detonating and that right behind the claymore is a perfectly safe place to be -- wrong..\n\nWhile there are some mines that can be triggered by the mine itself, the vast majority of them are fired by an individual using the clacker (or rather, the M57 firing device.)   And they are absolutely devastating when they go off.\n\nWhile in the US Army, I got to see a Claymore mine detonated in person.  It was one of those US Weapons demonstrations that they do in basic training to get the soldiers pumped up, and let me tell ya -- the Claymore was damn impressive.   The drill sergeants had setup human silhouettes all around the claymore, front and back.  Those in front were about 150 feet away and those in back were about 50 feet away.\n\nWhen the drill finally pushed the plunger, the world moved.   A massive explosion took place and a huge cloud of dust and debris rained down..  The drill came walking up with a huge shit-eating grin and once the smoke cleared ALL of the silhouettes were gone.     We got to see them after wards too, no one would have lived.  Thats when it became clear to me that the Claymore mine was NOT compatible with life..\n\nThe Claymore mine fires 700 1/6th inch steel balls and uses the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misznay-Schardin_effect\" target=\"_blank\">Misznay-Schardin Effect</a> to spray those balls outward in a 60 degree arc in front of the mine. (Thus the iconic, \"FRONT TOWARDS ENEMY\").    Within that 60 degree arc it has an effective range of 65 to 100 feet, out of that 60 degree arc the range is less, but the mine is still quite effective and you're gonna have a bad day if you're closer to it than 50 feet.  I mean think about it, it has almost a full pound of c-4 explosive in it;  that will ruin anyones day.\n\nIn 1954 Picatinny Arsenal issued criteria that the claymore mine had to meet, they were as follows;\n\n* Must weigh less than 3 pounds.\n* Must throw enough fragments so that at a range of 55 yards (50 meters) it achieves a 100 percent strike rate on a 1.3 square feet target (in other words, it always must hit a person at 55 yards)\n* Fragment area must not be more than 8 feet high and no more than 60 degrees\n* Fragments must have a velocity of 4,000 feet per second of kinetic energy delivered to the target.\n\nThis means that if you're closer than 55 yards you're going to be hit by at least one if not more steel balls traveling at 3500+ feet per second..  That's just awful..  Not bad for a device that costs less than $200 each.\n\nI think it seriously down plays the effectiveness and devastation that a Claymore mine can put out when some game says it only has a range of 3 or 4 virtual feet and, oh you can live through it, and oh its safe to lay down behind it..\n\nYou can't live through it, they have a good long range, and it only takes one of those 700 ball bearings to kill you.\n\nYou certainly can't lay down behind it and be safe .. On the front it says \"FRONT TOWARDS ENEMY\", and on the back it says \"GET THE FUCK AWAY!!\".. er.. okay it just says \"BACK\", but maybe it should say more..\n","previous":{"next":{"path":"_posts/2008-05-14-front-towards-enemy.md","url":"/front-towards-enemy/","relative_path":"_posts/2008-05-14-front-towards-enemy.md","id":"/front-towards-enemy","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Games","Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Front Towards Enemy!","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2008/06/claymore.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-05-14 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"front-towards-enemy","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2008-04-22-anyone-seen-my-hobby.md","output":null,"content":"I was asked the other day why I don't update my website more often..    A fine question, and I can only offer one answer..  I just don't want to..\n\nEr let me amend that..

I'm a software guy -- having said that, sometimes I feel that I need to give a particular OS a nod -- and in this case, a piece of hardware too.\n\nI have 2 main computers that I use at home (beyond my work laptop, my home server and my firewall proxy box)..  One is my super uber game machine, and one is my catch all play around machine.   The game machine is a windows box because I don't have much choice -- you want to play games, you use windows.  Go Win-tendo!\n\nThe play machine was an Ubuntu box until last weekend when a thunderstorm killed it.   We have surge protectors on all our machines and a dedicated circuit for this part of the house, but for whatever reason this machine didn't weather the storm.  It was a very old machine and it had been rebuilt many times over so really it was due.\n\nSo, I figured it was time to get a new machine.  Originally I was going to get a \"shuttle\" machine which is a small PC but then someone else pointed out that the MacMini's are perfect for what I am wanting to do..\nI was intrigued.  Firstly, I wanted to do some iPhone SDK stuff and didn't have a mac, plus I wanted to get a small machine that wouldn't be the huge honkin box it was replacing.  The mini would be perfect!\nI figured what the hell and made the splurge.  It was only $600 after tax with my IBM discount so really I couldn't complain -- and let me tell ya, this little machine is great!\n\nI really haven't ever been a full time mac user, so I didn't really know what to expect.  Most of my mac experience comes from a machine I used for about a year back in 1994.. Quite a different animal, trust me.  Leopard is fantastic. It really is very simple and intuitive.  Plus now that it's just a BSD machine it is amazingly simple to get stuff working.\n\nMy very first challenge was to get Synergy up and running so I didn't need a keyboard/mouse attached to the box.  Yeah.. that took about 20 minutes.  The hard part was figuring out the \"launchd\" system which I wasn't used to.  But once I got that sorted out, it was cake!\n\nSo far everything just works.  It reminds me of Ubuntu in that way..  I really have to wonder how Windows is still around..  And you're reading the blog of a LONG TIME windows user.. I mean I went from Amiga to Windows 3.1..  I continued to use Windows NT long after it was popular to do so, and then used Win2k pro well beyond when XP was the standard..\n\nI can honestly say that at this point, I'll never go Vista.  Why would I?!  XP does everything I need for games, and for anything else I'll use linux or now Mac.  So far I'm very happy with the MacMini.\n\nI do have one complaint about the hardware: it comes with Wifi and frankly, it's not very good.  The mac mini wifi seems to drop it's connection or at least work intermittently at best, even when the receiver is less than 3 feet away.  I was pretty underwhelmed by that one aspect of the device.. Other than that its great!\n\nAnd I do have one complaint about the software:  the home and end key don't work the way I think they should and no amount of remapping or fixing seems to make them work like they do on the PC.  It's annoying.\n\nI would highly recommend it.\n","previous":{"next":{"path":"_posts/2008-04-16-im-a-software-guy.md","url":"/im-a-software-guy/","relative_path":"_posts/2008-04-16-im-a-software-guy.md","id":"/im-a-software-guy","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"I'm a software guy...","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-04-16 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"im-a-software-guy","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2008-02-25-video-games-make-me-do-bad-things.md","output":null,"content":"So yet another campus shooting is in the headlines.

I have yet to kill anyone in real life because of some voices in my head spawned by the games that I play..

Someone did something awful and we must immediately blame something or someone!   Of course, we can't blame the parents for their sloppy job, nor can we blame the individual that actually committed the crime -- no no, that would hit too close to home and imply that people are responsible for their actions..   We can't have that..  I mean thats just crazy talk.. No something else must be the cause, that way we can all go on and not take responsibility for any of our actions.\n\nClearly some influence in his life made him go out and kill people!   *gasp* He played a game once while listening to rap music while wearing his D&amp;D hat!\n\nIdiots.\n\nI'd love to see the comparison of the number of people killed by video games, rap music and D&amp;D combined, versus the number of people killed by religion.  That would be amusing, and yet wouldn't do a damn thing towards making these hypocrites shut the fuck up.\n\nThey always want to blame video games, music, D&amp;D, or some other activity rather than looking at the simple facts;\n\nThe individual was disturbed and had suicidal intentions -- period.  Often when someone is wanting to commit suicide they will go to extreme lengths to make sure that they go through with it.  In this case, it was to take a gun to school and shoot a bunch of classmates.  It sucks, it's awful, it happens.
