It's wet. It's cold out (35ish) and there is visible ice on the sides of the road from the previous nights freeze.  The main part of the road was clearish, but I was still going too fast for conditions.\n\nSome redneck jackass gets in behind me and is flashing his lights while tailgating..  Clearly I'm not going fast enough for him.\n\nNow, I'm eventually turning left on this road so I don't want to change lanes, and we are coming up on a car in the right lane that is driving pretty slowly..  I just didn't feel it was safe to change lanes.  Not the case with this guy behind me.. He whips around me on the icy road, flipping me off and honking all the while, and when he gets in front of me he jams on his brakes..\n\nAt this point, It should be legal for me to open fire.   This guy is driving recklessly and trying to cause a wreck with me - there is a very clear case for road rage in that instance, but I have only my word against his.  Though I may be in luck there, a person of this nature probably hasn't yet mastered the power of speech..\n\nMy question is; Why do people insist on driving like jerks?!\n\nI wasn't doing anything wrong.  I was doing the speedlimit in the left lane, on icy/wet roads at night.    Even if it was perfectly dry roads, in the middle of the afternoon.  If I'm doing the speedlimit, I'm golden. There aint shit you can say.\n\nThis is the point that everyone chimes in and says, \"Slow traffic is supposed to keep right.\"  No.  Wrong.  Define for me \"slow traffic.\"   If I'm doing the speed limit, it aint me. More over, tell me when you're allowed legally to exceed the speedlimit.  Hint: Never. Not even passing.\n\nYet some how I'm the asshole for following the law. The sad thing is, even though there is a major car accident something like every 8 seconds in America alone, it will take a person living through one before they learn anything.\n\nI don't plan to be in one -- You wanna go faster than me, faster than the speed limit?  Go the fuck around.\n","collection":"posts","url":"/goddamn-i-hate-people/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2007-01-19-ie7s-jsfoo-sucks-so-badly-its-painful.md","collection":"posts","url":"/ie7s-jsfoo-sucks-so-badly-its-painful/","path":"_posts/2007-01-19-ie7s-jsfoo-sucks-so-badly-its-painful.md","id":"/ie7s-jsfoo-sucks-so-badly-its-painful","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"IE7's JSFoo sucks so badly it's painful!","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2007-01-19 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"ie7s-jsfoo-sucks-so-badly-its-painful","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2007-01-18-goddamn-i-hate-people.md","excerpt":"Some redneck jackass gets in behind me and is flashing his lights while tailgating..

IE7's javascript engine is complete shit.  They need to scrap it completely and start over.  Firstly, It's sloooowww..  IE7's JS is slower than IE6.. which I find to be impressive as IE6 was slow as hell..\n\nIn one of my current projects we have a bunch of objects being cloned in real time to make a popup menu.  It pops up over all other divs and what not from a nested element to a child element of the body.  It's a very simple procedure;\n\nMouse over the icon - pop goes the menu.\n\nWe are attaching the event to fire the pop dynamically.. (Don't even get me started on the \"attachEvent\" command.. Can we please use addEventListener like everyone else.. )  When the even fires it is sent to a function which does the work.\n\nAll other browsers know that \"this\" in that function is the sender.. Not IE.  IE expressly requires you to define the sender through the function handle and then call \"sender.fromElement\" to get the sender.  That's retarded.  Oh but the good times don't stop there.. No no..\n\nSee it takes time to figure out who the sender is, and it will report the sender as whatever is below the mouse when it finally gets around to it.    So the fromElement could be fricken anything! Its the most unreliable crap on the planet.\n\nThank you very much Microsoft for this wonderful piece of crap browser.

Yes, before napster.    Well after I sold it to change music, they did nothing with it.   And I do mean absolutely nothing.  Depressing really.\n\nEventually the domain fell into ruin and actually became a porn site for a while.. heh  After which it was picked up by BuyDomains.com a domain squatter - the bane of the internet (Sorry guys, I think very little of your business model).  They were offering to sell the domain at a \"reasonable rate\".   So seven years later, on a whim and completely for nostalgic reasons since the market is dead, I sent off an email asking how much they wanted for the domain.\n\nI got nothing in response, except to find myself suddenly on their spam list.  (Thankfully I used a disposable email address because I'm sure they sell that crap.)  Eventually I get a message which is from <a href=\"mailto:plamson@buydomains.com\" target=\"_blank\">Peter Lamson</a>, their \"Senior Vice President and General Manager\"  .. the head squatter!  I sent him an email saying that I hadn't actually got a quote yet.. just spam.\n\nHe seemed nice enough and forwarded me to the right people..\n\nAt this point I'd like to take a time out and say, what the hell?!  Their market is selling domains (at ludicrous prices) and in order to buy a domain you must send them an email... to which they don't respond?\n\nI mean if that was your primary contact method shouldn't you .. oh I dunno.. respond?!  You know if your sales are low maybe you should look into that a tad, don't ya think?\n\nAnyway, so after Peter, I got an email from David Helgeson which said the following;\n\n\n    Thank you for touching base with us.\n\n    This domain is currently priced at $64,000.00.\n\n    Let me know that this quote made it out to you and how that price works for you.\n\n    Thanks\n\n    David Helgeson\n    Sales Executive, BuyDomains.com\n\n\nWell there David.. I got the email.. uh.. is that price in pesos? I mean really.. Are you serious?\n\nIf I were asking to buy the domain \"Google.com\" shortly after Google went belly up (riiight), then maybe.. after all that's an extremely valuable company.  But Palavista.com?!  I know EXACTLY what that domain is worth.. I created it.  I am the one that made a small business out of it, and ultimately sold it.\n\nThe price you're asking is just retarded.. It's completely unrealistic, and a foolish business choice on your part.  You've just priced that domain out of reach.  And I mean out of everyones reach.  No one will buy that domain, Ever..  Why would they?   You can pick another one, that you haven't squatted and for the low low price of $70 a year ( or whatever the current going rate is.. )\n\nI hate the whole domain squatter thing.. I think it's retarded.. especially since there is case law that says it can be taken away from you.  Changemusic / Raremediagroup owns the IP for palavista.   They could very likely sue you and get the domain for free.  It's been done -  heh probably to you guys..\n\nI guess your business model is based on hope and stupidity..  You offer a price that is half my annual income and just hope that I'm stupid enough to go for it..   Or you praying that some company will come along and buy it - again why would they.. see the above.\n\nRetarded.  If you guys just offer a more reasonable price you might actually sell some of these things.  Here was my response;\n\n    David,\n\n    As the former owner of that domain, and the creator of palavista.com in the first place.  I can tell you without any doubt what so ever, you will never get that price for that domain. You could drop several of the zero's off the end and still not get that price - It's simply not that useful of a domain.\n\n    At most I would purchase it for nostalgia purposes.. I'll leave you with my initial response upon seeing the price;\n\n    Bhahahhahaha .. Good luck with that..=)\n\n    -Jason\n\nI seriously hope that if they ever do sell it, they send me a big fat F*ck you email saying how much they got for it.   That would amuse me if I was completely wrong and someone bought it for $64 grand.    It wont happen.

VERY long.. but awesome..  Humans are in fact, made of meat.\n\nHowever, the pinnacle of the visit turned out to be the show we saw on the night before we came home.  We got to see the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cirquedusoleil.com/cirquedusoleil/ka/\">Cirque Du Soleil show, Kà</a> at the MGM Grand.  It was more than impressive.  A very good show and I recommend it.  However, I would say that the $69.95 nose bleed seats aren't the way to go.. But since the trip as a whole was meant to be done on the cheap, It was okay.\n\nEasily the worst part of the trip was the flight to and from Vegas.. Both were so turbulent that I nearly lost my lunch.. I hate planes..  On the way home they had to pull the plane back to the gate after we had pushed back to replace something that had broken.. Nothing instills confidence more than knowing you have fresh parts, on your broken plane..\n\nAll in all I had fun.. it was a fun trip but Vegas isn't what I remember it being..\n","collection":"posts","url":"/vegas-baby/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2007-03-12-elevator-etiquette.md","collection":"posts","url":"/elevator-etiquette/","path":"_posts/2007-03-12-elevator-etiquette.md","id":"/elevator-etiquette","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Elevator Etiquette","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2007-03-12 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"elevator-etiquette","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2007-03-02-vegas-baby.md","excerpt":"Well we just got back from a three day in Vegas..
