This new monitor is something like six inches bigger all the way around and I have found nirvana...\n\nAll for $279.  *gleee*   For the record that's less than what I had paid for my 20\" wide screen a couple years ago.. This new monitor is way bigger and has better stats all around, for less!\n\nI have my new monitor replacing the old on the wall mount behind my desk..  I love technology..\n\nThe first thing I noticed about this monitor was how bright it was.. As soon as I turned it on it was blinding compared to my old screen..  I'm sure I'll get used to it, but dang..\n\nThe other thing that was fun was that I logged into my current first person shooter and had to actually turn my head, to see the whole screen!!! hehe   Gona give a couple of my simulation games a try here soon.. I bet it will be awesome..\n\n<table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<h3 id=\"detailspecs\">Specifications</h3>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<table

alt=\"District 9\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" class='pull-right' />\n\nMy initial reaction to District 9, upon the movie ending was to say -- and I quote; \"What the fuck was that?!\"  I sort of felt like my soul had just been raped, and I was just beginning to feel the crush of information as I processed the movie I had just watched..\n\nLet me start by saying that District 9 is an extremely interesting movie and most likely not what you will expect..  In fact I described it to my best friend as being \"completely fucked up and horribly dark with a message that is delivered in an extremely heavy handed manner --  but at the same time.. kinda cool..\"   And I stand by that description now that I have had time to process..\n\nIt wasn't bad.  It really wasn't.. even though my review is harsh, I kind of liked it and will watch it again 'cause I'm sure there was a lot I missed..\n\nHowever, this movie makes no attempt to hide that it has a message, and by god you're going to get the message like it or not..  For the first 3/4 of the movie the happy go-lucky recently promoted dork goes about committing what amounts to horribly brutal and inhumane acts.. (of a character similar to crimes against humanity).. of enforcing racial segregation...   against an already segregated people..  in South Africa..  Hrmmm If only there were a cogent paradigm..\n\n\"Down with the aliens!!  Keep those Kaffer's .. er I mean 'Prawns' out of our towns!\"  Okay got it.. Apartheid is bad.. No shit.. uh..  Wasn't it outlawed back in the early 90's for exactly that reason?  Oh they aren't from Earth so it's okay..  Feh..\n\nAll during this process the movie is just dragging ass..  Shot from a \"news footage\" point of view you have to watch people beat, humiliate, torture and even kill the prawns (the offensive and ONLY name given to the alien race) just 'cause they are aliens, for a good .. long .. while .. from shaky cam news footage style..  (many times in places that it made no sense to shoot it that way as there wouldn't be a camera there..)   Simply put,  this part of the movie was horribly dark and depressing, and just too long..\n\nIt was so long that one guy got up and left the theatre..   We were at <a href=\"http://www.drafthouse.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Alamo Drafthouse</a>, where they serve beer and food while you watch the movie, and this guy bailed.. it was that hard to watch..  They really didn't develop the aliens characters overly much either..\n\nAll of the prawns are portrayed as these loathsome scavengers, locked in this multi-block enclosure where they had been for 20 years whom behave in disgusting alien ways..  As such it really evokes zero sympathy for them..  We really learned nothing about them as a race of people, why they were here, how they interact with each other, their children, us etc.. and you were given the impression we weren't supposed to care..   Thus the focus seems to be on the dork and abusing the prawns..\n\nIn all likelihood it actually didn't go on that long, but it sure as hell seemed like it..\n\nEventually the happy go-lucky dork gets infected by the magical mystical goo that the aliens had been struggling for 20 years to acquire/create and slowly starts transforming into a prawn.   The dork got the goo from the friend of the main protagonist prawn who in the next scene has his brains blown out.. (assuming he keeps his brains in his head.. )\n\nWe know nothing about this goo other than it's bad for humans, it's impossibly hard to create, and apparently a couple drops will power a space ship the size of a city across a galaxy..   Huge holes around the goo, but fine.. cheap plot device -- the aliens struggled for 20 years to create it -- its very important to them in that it powers their ship and is the reason they are stuck here -- it turns humans into prawns -- and is now in the hands of the humans.\n\nSuddenly due to the infection the dork has his entire life stripped away from him; his hot wife, his new job, his dorky identity.. he's portrayed to the media as this highly contagious alien fornicator (prawn fucker) and is on the run from the law.. There is only one place he can go!  Guess where.. Go ahead and guess..\n\nYou even have other painful cliche characters like;\n\n* The overzealous military guy who just loves pulling the wings off flies..\n* The innocent and way too hot wife of the dork who loves her man.. is mad at her man.. wants nothing to do with her man.. no no wait.. she forgives him.. loves her man again..\n* The gun running, drug doing, voodoo gang over lord who you just know will cause all manner of trouble.. for no good reason other than \"you had your chance, its my turn to have the power now..\"\n* The token black guy being trained for the dorks job and was the only guy on the team that was specifically not given a kevlar vest to wearing. \"Don't worry about it.. wear this red shirt instead..\"\n* And of course.. the evil father-in-law that secretly had been running covert body snatcher like biological experiments on the prawns all along and now was going to have the newly infected son-in-law killed because his organization needs his DNA in order to be able to use the alien weapons..   wait.. what?!\n\nI mean seriously it's painfully obvious where it's going to go.. It just took a long time to get there..  He slowly learns the errors of his ways and decides to help the main protagonist prawn get his prawny son, two characters we really knew very little about but who in the end are more humane than we are, to the mother ship before ultimately turning into a prawn himself.\n\nSo.. The dork, who at this point is half turning into an alien gathers up alien and human weapons by force from the gun running voodoo guy and storms the organizations compound in order to get the goo back, all the while the gun running voodoo guy is threatening revenge..\n\nAnd so begins the running fire fight which would be the new mode of the movie from here on out..\n\nSuddenly the part of Peter Jackson is played by Micheal Bay.. And we are rewarded for our sticking out the \"message\" portion of the movie with lots of bullets and explosions -- and of course some of the best CG \"mech\" porn I have seen in a long time... in fact.. ever..\n\nReally I can simply describe everything from this point on as a constant running firefight with the main dork redeeming himself by killing everyone from the inside of an extremely well done CG mech.\n\nThe movie itself looks sort of like black hawk down with aliens..  The attention to detail everywhere was actually pretty darn good..  The aliens looked great!  And the special effects for the alien weaponry, especially the mech was very well done.  I was less impressed by the ships.. but what can ya do..\n\nThe dork, now hero, escorts the main prawn protagonist as far as he can,  even going as far as to say \"go on without me, don't make my sacrifice for nothing..\"\n\nThe prawn says, with a black tear in his eye, \"I'll be back in three years.. I promise..\"  Then turns and runs to the ship while the dork/hero continues to fight on.  He eventually gets to the ship, takes off.. and flies away.\n\nThe dork/hero's mech finally is destroyed -- opens up and coughs the hero out as it colapses into a heap and of course the cliche military guy comes up and gives a nice monolog about how he will enjoy killing the dork/hero..  Which never happens because all the rest of the prawns run up and rip him to shreds..\n\nThe end.\n\nOr is it?  The last thing we see is confirmation that the dork/hero has turned fully into a prawn and we know that all the prawns left on Earth have been moved from district 9 to district 10..   I'm pretty damned sure there was some foreshadowing being hammered into us here too..  The \"3 years\" number was thrown around quite a lot.. and moving them from District 9 to District 10 seemed obvious... etc..\n\nThe movie had gaping plot holes.. Completely underdeveloped or not even remotely developed main characters..  It had a horrible and down right offensive message that was delivered in quite possibly the worst way.. And really had very few redeeming qualities..  I seriously hope they don't make a sequel.. However, if they do it would almost have to be better than the first one..\n\nSo having said that;  I kind of liked it..  The visuals were good candy, and I do like my candy but the rest of it kind of hurt..\n","collection":"posts","url":"/movie-review-district-9/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2009-08-15-movie-review-district-9.md","collection":"posts","url":"/movie-review-district-9/","path":"_posts/2009-08-15-movie-review-district-9.md","id":"/movie-review-district-9","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Movie Review: District 9","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2009/08/district9-poster-200x300.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-08-15 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"movie-review-district-9","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2009-08-20-god-i-hate-planes.md","content":"Dear god but I hate flying on major airlines.

But compared to average (likely) weight of the folks walking around that convention center.. I'm doing just fine.\n\nIt really did seem like there were very few average build people walking around.   Everybody was either rail thin and pasty or extremely heavy.   Sad really.\n\nThe one thing I was plesantly surprised about was the lack of smell.  I went expecting the unwashed nerds problem you typically see at comic-cons etc..  But clearly the blizzcon attracts a higher class of dork, as we all know how to use soap.  Yay us!    (Yes, I fully include myself as one of the dorks.. High class dork thank you..)\n\nFor me the major disappointment in the whole trip was that no mention was made of the new MMO that blizzard is working on.  It's been in the rumor mill for a while now that they are working on some brand new MMO with completely new IP.  Some folks say it will be a Starcraft MMO but most say that's not the case..  Beyond that.. nothing.\n\nI really had hoped they'd give us a clue as to what it would be, but I guess that will be next years blizzcon.. heh  I have lots more to say about this whole event and I'll get to it eventually but right now I'm tired.\n\nI will say that it was a good time, and I wouldn't mind going again.   I hated the flights of course, primarily because I don't like flying but that's hardly blizzards fault..  I also wished there weren't thirty thousand people there as it was silly to have to wait in line, in order to get in line to try something.. yeah not kidding.. it was like being jammed in an elevator..  (An elevator that has over 813000 square feet of space.. Yes its that big.. and yes it was that full..)\n\nBut those things aside.. it was good.\n","collection":"posts","url":"/back-from-blizzcon-2009/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2009-08-24-back-from-blizzcon-2009.md","collection":"posts","url":"/back-from-blizzcon-2009/","path":"_posts/2009-08-24-back-from-blizzcon-2009.md","id":"/back-from-blizzcon-2009","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Back from Blizzcon 2009","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2009/08/blizzcon-logo.png","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-08-24 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"back-from-blizzcon-2009","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2009-09-25-1055-miles-on-two-wheels.md","content":"<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2009/09/Motorcycle-Pic-2.JPG\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Motorcycle Closeup\" src=\"/images/2009/09/Motorcycle-Pic-2-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Smile!

Yer about to get wet!</span></a>\n\nSo my father turned 68 this year.  I thought it would be a nice gift to give him my tractor lawn mower and a few other items that I knew he could use that I simply no longer needed.   The main issue was getting the tractor to him.. I mean this thing aint small and I no longer have a truck..  I decided the best bet would be to rent a truck and haul it to him..  It's a thousand mile trip from my home in Texas to his in Tennissee and I didn't really look forward to that drive in that truck..  I certainly didn't want to make it twice!    So I also loaded up my Motorcycle with the plan of riding it back.\n\nFirst to the truck;  I rented a Penske 16' truck and told the lady on the phone what I wanted to do.  She didn't seem to care, even though once I got the truck they label on the wall said no gasoline powered vehicles..  *shrug* I told her what I was planning to do, so as far as I was concerned I was okayed to do it..  The mower was out of gas anyway and the motorcycle had very little in it.. I think their intent was to keep you from causing a fire and that was my intent too, so all was well..\n\nLoading everything into the truck was a bit tough since the wheels on the mower were wider than the ramp hehe.. but once in the truck everything was fine..  I had LOTS of room to spare, but it was the smallest truck I could get.. ( and the cheapest)\n\nThe reason I rented Penske was because they were down right cheap compared to everyone else, and the truck was a  nice one for the most part.. Extremely minimalistic and it seriously needed cruise control.. but other than that it was a good truck.  I was able to rent it for $230..  U-Haul wanted almost $900!!!  The other places I called were either just as expensive or wouldn't let me take the truck out of state..   Yay Penske!  You just earned my business..\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2009/09/Motorcycle-Pic-1.JPG\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"Motorcycle Ride\" src=\"/images/2009/09/Motorcycle-Pic-1-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Getting ready to go.. woops didn't smile\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Getting ready to go.. woops didn&#39;t smile</span></a>\n\nOnce I got everything loaded up I headed out..  The trip to TN from TX was fairly uneventful.. I ended up not leaving until around 6pm just due to circumstances beyond my control so I knew I would be driving kind of late.. Around 2am I decided I was tired and needed to stop.. I only got about 450 miles..  The second day I got up at 9am and made it the rest of the way, getting to their house around 9pm their time.   I wish that truck didn't have a speed governor in it..  It flat out wouldn't go faster than 75 miles an hour, unless you were going down hill.   And at 80 miles an hour it would kick in an engine break and you'd slow down no matter what!\n\nOver the course of the next several days I got to hang out with my father, step mother and step brother..  It was a nice time..  We didn't really do an awful lot, just visit  mostly..  We went out to eat a couple times and went walking through the sprawling metropolis of their small town (it took about 15 minutes..hehe)..\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2009/09/CatandDog.JPG\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Bella and Maggie\" src=\"/images/2009/09/CatandDog-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Bella and Maggie\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Bella and Maggie</span></a>\n\nAnd of course I got to play with Maggie (the dog) and Bella (the cat) when they would tollerate me.   Maggie was just about never there but rather out trolling the neighborhood, Bella was a constant bundle of energy and was quite amusing to watch.. Kittens always are..\n\nI kept telling Dianne I was gonna take bella home with me =)  I might have too had I known it would have been a sure fire way of being kicked out of the family.. hehe  Bella seemed pretty attached to Dianne..  So much so she followed her around like a shadow..\n\nThe only down side about the whole trip to be honest was how tired I was..  I have no idea how Ed drives all day long like he does.. Driving long distance wears me out.. I think partly because it bores me, but traveling in general just makes me tired..   The truck drive up there in the rain, in a vehicle I wasn't really comfortable in, going someplace I had never driven to before..etc.. only served to tire me.\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2009/09/Tired.JPG\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"Me (tired), Dad (amused)\" src=\"/images/2009/09/Tired-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Me (tired), Dad (amused)\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Me (tired), Dad (amused)</span></a>\n\nAdd to this now the fact that I would be sleeping the next 3 days on a pull out sofa bed that had a bar strategically placed to keep guests from overstaying their welcome, and that generally speaking my folks get up about 2 hours before I do and you begin to see the issue..   I just didn't get much sleep..  I was tired to begin with, sleeping on an uncomfortable and foreign bed, in a house that isn't mine, with folks who get up before I normally do ..etc..   I was doomed to be tired.. hehe\n\nMy wife actually commented to me on one of the few occasions I had cell service while up there that I looked completely zonked.. She was amazed at the bags under my eyes..  I didn't really realize it until I saw the photos.. Man I was tired.. I look aweful.. (More than normal..)\n\nI did finally get to ride the cherahala skyway on my motorcycle which is something that my folks have been after me to do for a while.  It's a very very pretty ride with tons of other bikers up there for the view and the fun of it..  Bikes of every kind going every which way up and down a very twisty road..\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2009/09/BaldRiverRoadSign.jpg\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Bald River Falls Road\" src=\"/images/2009/09/BaldRiverRoadSign-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Bald River Falls Road\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Bald River Falls Road</span></a>\n\nIt's just gorgeous..  My favorite area is the Bald River Falls area, which technically isn't on the skyway but rather a turn off of it.. its a nice long ride (18 miles or so) where you pretty much have a cliff face on one side with forest and what not, and a drop off on the other side with a river running down it..  No guard rails for most of it and the road gets down right narrow on a few parts of it..  People drive way too fast down that road, down all roads in TN to be honest..  I almost got ran off the road once when a pack of about 10 Honda S2000's zipped by me doing some sort of group run..\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2009/09/BaldRiverFalls.jpg\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"Bald River Falls (Large)\" src=\"/images/2009/09/BaldRiverFalls.jpg\" alt=\"Bald River Falls (Large)\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Bald River Falls (Large)</span></a>\n\nI stopped at Bald River Falls and took a bunch of photos, most of which came out nicely but you see one picture of forest you've seen them all..  The falls itself is very pretty.. The image I have included is a large picture for those that want to use it for something..\n\nI would have stayed out on the road longer and taken my time but it was raining.. You can't see it in the falls picture or the road picture, but it was down right wet..   The weather was the pits the whole time I was there..  It was always sprinkling at the very least or a full blown gully washer at one point..\n\nI spent time with dad talking about wood working and he showed me how to make a bowl (that was cool), but we got trapped out in his shop by the rain.  It was raining so hard while we were out there that we could pretty much just look at one another, the metal roof kept us from talking (or rather from being heard..)   but I got to see him rough out a bowl on his big lathe, that was pretty neat.  Ed took pictures of it and I hope to get them from him so I can post some.. it was an interesting process.. Makes me kind of want to try it..   I just don't have the lathe, or the money to get one..\n\nEventually I realized that I needed to ponder heading home..  My original plan was to wait until it stopped raining and drive home then.. Yeah its a week later, and its still raining up there..  One look at the forecast and I knew that the whole \"wait for the rain to stop\" plan wasn't going to work..\n\nSo I went the other route;  Take extra days getting home and go slow.  Motorcycles in the rain aren't nearly as bad as most people think..  Put on enough rain gear and you stay quite dry.. infact, I never got wet at all even though I drove through about 600 miles of wet weather..\n\nThe issue really is the water on the road and the big trucks..  You know how when you're driving down the road in your and there is a big puddle that you can't avoid, you throw up a bunch of water and kinda hydroplane for a few feet..   yeah that's bad on a bike.. Also the big trucks that throw a lot of spray, also bad but for different reasons.\n\nSo I intentionally left a day early with intent to take my time getting home..  And while the road was wet and it was raining nearly the whole first day, it wasn't bad at all..  I never felt in danger..\n\nThe first day I ended up driving 650 miles before I just had to stop..  I had to stop not because I was wet, or tired.. but because I was SORE!\n\nMy lower back was complaining loudly as were my knees..  Other than that I was fine.. I was in good spirits, I had my audio books and music to listen to and the bike was eating up the road like no tomorrow, but my back and knees were barkin' and I had to raise the white flag..\n\nI stayed at a motel on the side of the road (A days inn I believe it was) for the night and then started over again in the morning..  The next day it didn't rain a single drop and it was beautiful the whole time.. I got home faster than it took me to get there!\n\nOn the one hand I felt bad because I had left a day earlier than I had originally planned, but on the other I was glad to be home..  I missed Melissa and it was nice to come home and give her a hug.. (*shrug* She smells good..)\n\nI'm 100% thankful for the \"Throttle meister\" my motorcycle has.. The fellow who had the bike before me spent the extra $200 to put what amounts to a cruise control on the bike.. Thank god..  Holding the throttle open for over a thousand miles would have killed my hand.. Primarily because the throttle has a fairly stiff spring and is resisting being turned.. as it should..  The throttle meister basically holds the throttle open for you..\n\nThe second thing I'm thankful for is my bikes gas milage.  It cost me $58 to drive 1055 miles on my bike, and that's buying the expensive gas.. It cost almost that much for one tank full of the cheap stuff on the truck drive up there..\n\nAll in all it was a fantastic trip.. I very much enjoyed the time I spent with the folks while up there, and had a hell of a good time on the ride home..   My initial reaction upon getting home was to think; \"Dear god I'm not doing that again any time soon\".. primarily because I was sore..  But upon reflection, I was only sore for a day.. I would do that trip again..\n","collection":"posts","url":"/1055-miles-on-two-wheels/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2009-09-28-carl-sagan-a-glorious-dawn.md","collection":"posts","url":"/carl-sagan-a-glorious-dawn/","path":"_posts/2009-09-28-carl-sagan-a-glorious-dawn.md","id":"/carl-sagan-a-glorious-dawn","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Carl Sagan - A Glorious Dawn","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2009/09/carl.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-09-28 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"carl-sagan-a-glorious-dawn","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2009-09-25-1055-miles-on-two-wheels.md","excerpt":"So my father turned 68 this year.  I thought it would be a nice gift to give him my tractor lawn mower and a few other items that I knew he could use that I simply no longer needed.   The main issue was getting the tractor to him..","id":"/1055-miles-on-two-wheels","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"1055 Miles, on two wheels","layout":"post","tags":["Roadtrip","Motorcycle"],"image":"/images/2009/09/Motorcycle-Pic-2.JPG","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-09-25 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"1055-miles-on-two-wheels","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2009-08-24-back-from-blizzcon-2009.md","excerpt":"Well the wife and I are back from Blizzcon..  I have to admit she had a pretty good idea of going and now that we have gone and come back I'm glad we did it..","id":"/back-from-blizzcon-2009","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Back from Blizzcon 2009","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2009/08/blizzcon-logo.png","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-08-24 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"back-from-blizzcon-2009","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2009-08-20-god-i-hate-planes.md","excerpt":"Dear god but I hate flying on major airlines.
