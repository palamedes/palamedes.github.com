Holy crap.  It's awesome.  Not perfect by any stretch of the meaning, but as developer kits go it's impressive as hell.  Once the final consumer version comes out, you should get one.\n\nThe developers kit is very nice and extremely professionally produced.  The Rift unit itself seems pretty solid and works well once you get used to it (more on that in a minute).\n\nWhat amazes me about it is how good the accelerometers are.  The head tracking system is perfect.  I expected it to be kinda crappy to be honest, or lag a little when you turned your head but it really isn't.  Accelerometer technology has come a long way and the precision there is excellent.\n\nThe unit itself isn't heavy and in fact I stopped noticing it after the first 5 minutes.\n\nThe cost of the unit itself is $300 for the developer kit and they are guessing the final version will be between $300 and $400.  I think this is completely reasonable as it's essentially just another monitor.  How much did you pay for your nicest monitor?\n\nAs for the bad -- this is all I can really think of;\n\n_*Developer Kit Resolution:*_ The developer kit is very very good, but its really low resolution.  The system works by putting a small flat screen (think cellphone) about 3 inches from your eyes and putting two images on that single screen that you look at through lenses.   The picture as you have probably seen is just a fisheye view of whatever the game or software is displaying split in two and slightly offset to give you the left/right eye.  Clever.   But the dev kit has a 1280x800 resolution.  That means its effectively 640x800 per eye.  That's pretty poor.   The image itself while amazingly responsive and the over all performance of the unit is good, the image looks kind of like an image made with lego blocks a couple feet away.\n\nThe good news is they are working on the Resolution and the final version will be a lot higher.  So for a developer cheap version, this is awesome.\n\n_*Positional Tracking:*_ As I said in the review above the orientation tracking is amazing.  The unit itself has a gyroscope/accelerometer system that makes unit orientation spot on.  I was very happy with this, they did a fantastic job here.  But it has no positional tracking what so ever and likely wont ever have that without another piece of hardware.\n\nFor those familiar with the Track IR piece of hardware it gets around positional tracking by forcing you to put something on your head in order to get position in space, without that I'm not sure how good positional tracking could be.\n\nBut I hesitated to put this here as I dont know that it needs positional tracking.  I imagine there will be some pieces of software that could benefit from it, but for the most part I don't know that it's needed.\n\n_*Motion Sickness:*_ I NEVER get motion sick.  Never.  Not at all. .... or at least not until I used the Oculus Rift for 20 minutes.  This says a lot to me.  I know my wife and my best friend get motion sick if you show them a first person shooter for a minute or two.  I don't.   In fact one of my favorite games of all time was <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descent_(video_game)\" target=\"_blank\">Descent</a> a true 360 degree first person shooting game.  This is a game that was known for (and eternally banned for) making my buddy nearly projectile vomit. heh  Loved it.\n\nAnyway, the rift made me feel very queasy.  Stunned me actually.  But after 3 sessions of 20 minutes or so, I was able to play for an hour before it started to hit me.  So it's clear to me that this is something you just have to get used to.. But be warned.  I know some people that once they get motion sick are down for hours.\n\nMy only other suggestion or wish (aside from the higher resolution thing which is already coming) would be to have a slightly wider field a view.  I want it to wrap around more.\n\nBut seriously those are really minor complaints all things considered =)  If you're any kind of gamer at all, once the consumer version comes out.. get it.. You'll be glad you did.","previous":{"path":"_posts/2013-12-10-state-of-industry.md","url":"/state-of-industry/","relative_path":"_posts/2013-12-10-state-of-industry.md","id":"/state-of-industry","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Software Development"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"State of the Industry Concerns","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2013/12/cliff.jpg","gallery":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"tile_class":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2013-12-10 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"state-of-industry","ext":".md"},"url":"/oculus-rift/","relative_path":"_posts/2013-12-30-oculus-rift.md","id":"/oculus-rift","collection":"posts","excerpt":"After my first 48 hours with the Oculus Rift;  Holy crap.

I take umbrage with what frameworks like wordpress and jquery have done to us.  On the one hand they are great tools that serve a purpose and fill a need, but on the other you have a whole generation of people who have only ever learned how to use them and don't understand the underlying technology.. At all. \n\nAt GROK, we are interviewing \"developers\" and trying to find that right hire.  But the number of folks that have come forward claiming to be PHP experts have apparently really only ever worked with wordpress and as such have virtually zero understanding of PHP as a language.  How can you call yourself a PHP expert and not understand the object model? Or even what an object is in a couple cases.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the folks who say they know jquery and are an expert with it, but also say they don't know javascript... What?! That doesn't even make sense.. \n\nThat's like someone saying they are an accountant who is an expert at quickbooks, but that they don't understand basic accounting..  \n\nThe real tragedy is that these folks are able to get 85k to 120k jobs with their paltry skills and think its completely reasonable to expect to get more when they move on.   I think they are setting themselves up for an incredible fall.\n\nI have done a number of interviews now with different folks and while some of them were knowledgeable and good, some were embarrassingly bad.  \n\nMy interview style is rough but friendly.  It's no where near as bad as some of the pressure cooker/shark tanks I have been to in my day, but I expect you to know what you say you know at the level you say you know it.  \n\nIf I ask you what your PHP skill is 0 to 10 and you tell me 10, I'm gonna ask you questions that I would expect only Rasmus Lerdorf to know.   It stuns me how many people claim to be a 9 or 10, when they aren't even a 3..  This is what wordpress has done to us..  Same thing happens with javascript and jquery or any of the myriad of other frameworks out there. \n\nI realize we all have to start somewhere, but quite a lot of these people think they are senior developers when they wouldn't even qualify as a junior one.\n\nDo yourself a favor, learn the underlying technology.  Ask yourself; 'Why does this work?' \n\nA Javascript expert should be able to create their own jquery from scratch.  I'm not saying they should, just that they understand how it works and why it works and could if they needed to.  There's no mystery to it to them, it's just a tool.\n\nA PHP expert should be able to write wordpress from scratch.  etc..  (Come to think of it, a true PHP expert would look at the wordpress source and shudder.. )\n\nWhen your software goes from 'magic' to just another tool in your toolbox that you fully understand, then you can call yourself an expert.  Until then, you have some learning to do.\n","previous":{"next":{"path":"_posts/2013-12-10-state-of-industry.md","url":"/state-of-industry/","relative_path":"_posts/2013-12-10-state-of-industry.md","id":"/state-of-industry","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Software Development"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"State of the Industry Concerns","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2013/12/cliff.jpg","gallery":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"tile_class":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2013-12-10 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"state-of-industry","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2013-12-06-price-of-software.md","output":null,"content":"I don't work at a fast food restaurant, a pizza delivery joint, or behind the counter at a gas station.

But if I define it, it will be an MVP/POC first and iterate into a full blown product.  This is a topic for a different post though.)\n\nBut the common thread is that no matter the scope of the work, they always think we are too expensive and quite often expect to pay less than half or even a quarter of what is reasonable. \n\nFor example; The $10k job above would have required at least two full time developers to get it done within the 3 month deadline, if it's even possible to make the deadline without working a lot of overtime.

It requires a lot of time, effort and energy on my part to stay current and competitive in my industry so I have very little patience with people who think I get paid too much money for what I do. \n\nSorry, but anyone who says software engineers and architects get paid too much, don't understand what it takes to do what we do.\n\nI think the issue is most people just see the initial number and think its a lot.   On the surface, $10k is a lot of money.  And if I were given $10k for doing nothing then I'd be happy as a clam.\n\nMost people have no concept the amount of work, time, and effort that goes into writing software and as such they can't really fathom it.  Because they can't wrap their mind around it and because there is nothing physical to put value to, it's very easy to think that they are paying us that $10k for nothing and that we should be just happy as a clam for being offered it.\n\nIt pains me to have to be the one to explain to them that this isn't the case.  The problem comes when you have those people that are actually offended by the amount I say it would actually require in order to pull their dream off.   I'm usually looked at as a greedy bastard and thought of as a criminal.\n\nMost firms would charge closer to $100k for that 3 month job.  See what I mean?  You scoffed a little didn't you.\n\nAnd I'm just talking about the initial development cost.  Not maintenance fees, server hardware, data storage fees, design costs, testing costs etc..  \n\nThe problem with going with the $10k firm versus the $100k firm is that you get what you pay for.  The perceived value is in dollars only, without any thought or consideration to the quality of the work being done or the support you're going to get before start, during development and after completion.  (We give 6 months of bugfixes for free.)\n\nThey have already approached $10k firm for the product and they don't like the support / communication they were getting (read: the firm has just disappeared because 10k for this project is too low), so why are they looking for another $10k firm that will likely give them the exact same results?  \n\nYou get what you pay for and people some how refuse to learn that lesson with software.  \n\n\n\n\n\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2013-09-15-brasstown-bald.md","url":"/brasstown-bald/","relative_path":"_posts/2013-09-15-brasstown-bald.md","id":"/brasstown-bald","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Photography"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Brasstown Bald, the highest natural point in Georgia.","layout":"post","tags":["Scenic"],"image":"/images/2013/09/brasstownbald035.jpg","gallery":["/images/2013/09/brasstownbald000.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald001.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald002.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald003.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald004.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald005.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald006.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald007.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald008.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald009.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald010.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald011.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald012.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald013.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald014.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald015.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald016.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald017.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald018.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald019.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald020.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald021.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald022.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald023.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald024.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald025.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald026.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald027.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald028.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald029.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald030.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald031.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald032.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald033.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald034.jpg"],"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"2x2","tile_color":null,"tile_class":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2013-09-15 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"brasstown-bald","ext":".md"},"url":"/price-of-software/","relative_path":"_posts/2013-12-06-price-of-software.md","id":"/price-of-software","collection":"posts","excerpt":"You get what you pay for and people some how refuse to learn that lesson with software.","draft":false,"categories":["Software Development"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Software Development Costs","layout":"post","tags":["Costs"],"image":"/images/2013/12/software-development-costs.jpg","gallery":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"tile_class":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2013-12-06 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"price-of-software","ext":".md"},"url":"/state-of-industry/","relative_path":"_posts/2013-12-10-state-of-industry.md","id":"/state-of-industry","collection":"posts","excerpt":"When your software goes from 'magic' to just another tool in your toolbox that you fully understand, then you can call yourself an expert.

Not maintenance fees, server hardware, data storage fees, design costs, testing costs etc..  \n\nThe problem with going with the $10k firm versus the $100k firm is that you get what you pay for.  The perceived value is in dollars only, without any thought or consideration to the quality of the work being done or the support you're going to get before start, during development and after completion.  (We give 6 months of bugfixes for free.)\n\nThey have already approached $10k firm for the product and they don't like the support / communication they were getting (read: the firm has just disappeared because 10k for this project is too low), so why are they looking for another $10k firm that will likely give them the exact same results?  \n\nYou get what you pay for and people some how refuse to learn that lesson with software.  \n\n\n\n\n\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2013-09-15-brasstown-bald.md","url":"/brasstown-bald/","relative_path":"_posts/2013-09-15-brasstown-bald.md","id":"/brasstown-bald","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Photography"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Brasstown Bald, the highest natural point in Georgia.","layout":"post","tags":["Scenic"],"image":"/images/2013/09/brasstownbald035.jpg","gallery":["/images/2013/09/brasstownbald000.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald001.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald002.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald003.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald004.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald005.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald006.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald007.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald008.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald009.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald010.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald011.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald012.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald013.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald014.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald015.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald016.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald017.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald018.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald019.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald020.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald021.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald022.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald023.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald024.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald025.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald026.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald027.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald028.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald029.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald030.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald031.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald032.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald033.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald034.jpg"],"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"2x2","tile_color":null,"tile_class":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2013-09-15 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"brasstown-bald","ext":".md"},"url":"/price-of-software/","relative_path":"_posts/2013-12-06-price-of-software.md","id":"/price-of-software","collection":"posts","excerpt":"You get what you pay for and people some how refuse to learn that lesson with software.","draft":false,"categories":["Software Development"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Software Development Costs","layout":"post","tags":["Costs"],"image":"/images/2013/12/software-development-costs.jpg","gallery":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"tile_class":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2013-12-06 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"price-of-software","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2013-09-15-brasstown-bald.md","output":null,"content":"The wife and I hiked up to the top of Brasstown bald last weekend, and I snapped some photos.. It was a beautiful day and a nice trip.. I'd do it again..\n\nBrasstown bald is the highest natural point in the state of Georgia with a summit elevation of 4,784 feet above mean sea level.\n\nThe mountain is known to the native Cherokee people as Enotah.  It is named for the former Cherokee village of Brasstown, Georgia, located along the upper Brasstown Creek.\n\nAccording to the two Georgia historical markers, the area surrounding Brasstown Bald was settled by the Cherokee people. White settlers derived the word Brasstown from a translation error of a Cherokee word. Sounding very similar to another Cherokee word, settlers confused the word \"Itse'yĭ\" (New Green Place or Place of Fresh Green) with \"Ûňtsaiyĭ\" (Brass). Itse'yĭ, New Green Place, is a Cherokee locative name given to several distinct areas in the Cherokee world, including an area to the North of Brasstown Bald in North Georgia.\n\nCherokee legend tells of a great flood that swept over the land. Everyone that inhabited the land died except a few Cherokee families that sought refuge in a giant canoe. The canoe ran aground at the summit of the mountain. Having no wild game to hunt and no place to plant vegetation, the Great Spirit killed all of the trees on the top of the mountain so the surviving people could plant their crops. They continued planting until the water subsided.\n\nWhile the Cherokee legend tells of a treeless mountain top, the term \"bald\" is common mountain terminology describing mountaintops that have 360-degree unobstructed views. The official name that includes the word Bald in this case was not intended to suggest a once-treeless mountaintop, the way the term is used for most other Appalachian balds.\n\nOther names given to Brasstown Bald by the Cherokee: Echia, Echoee, Etchowee & Enotah.","previous":{"next":{"path":"_posts/2013-09-15-brasstown-bald.md","url":"/brasstown-bald/","relative_path":"_posts/2013-09-15-brasstown-bald.md","id":"/brasstown-bald","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Photography"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Brasstown Bald, the highest natural point in Georgia.","layout":"post","tags":["Scenic"],"image":"/images/2013/09/brasstownbald035.jpg","gallery":["/images/2013/09/brasstownbald000.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald001.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald002.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald003.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald004.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald005.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald006.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald007.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald008.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald009.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald010.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald011.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald012.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald013.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald014.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald015.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald016.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald017.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald018.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald019.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald020.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald021.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald022.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald023.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald024.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald025.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald026.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald027.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald028.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald029.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald030.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald031.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald032.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald033.jpg","/images/2013/09/brasstownbald034.jpg"],"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"2x2","tile_color":null,"tile_class":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2013-09-15 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"brasstown-bald","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2013-09-14-semantic-ui.md","output":null,"content":"I have been a long time fan and user of [twitterbootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap).
