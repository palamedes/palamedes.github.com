Palamedes outwitted Odysseus, making him join the expedition against Troy. For that reason Odysseus was hostile to Palamedes; and during the war Odysseus, having taken a Trojan prisoner, compelled him to write a letter of treasonable purport ostensibly sent by Priam to Palamedes; and having buried gold in the quarters of Palamedes, dropped the letter in the camp. Agamemnon read the letter, found the gold, and delivered up Palamedes to the allies to be stoned as a traitor.\n\n*__In Detail:__* Palamedes, inventor of the dice and of several letters of the alphabet, outwitted Odysseus, making him join the expedition against Troy. But Odysseus became hostile to him and Palamedes' cleverness proved fatal to himself. Palamedes and knowledge Contributions to knowledge. The contributions of Palamedes to knowledge were of such a nature that they have been named together with those made by the Egyptians and the Phoenicians. For the Egyptians, they say, were the first to represent thought by symbols and pictures of animals. These symbols are among the most ancient and, having being impressed upon stone, they are still visible today. And some have believed that the Phoenicians took the idea of the alphabet from the Egyptians and then imported it into Greece, being as they were predominant at sea. For it was Cadmus, they say, who taught the art of writing to the uncivilised Greeks, after having arrived with a Phoenician fleet. Many letters invented by Palamedes. King Cecrops of Athens has been also counted among those who promoted civilization. But during the time of the Trojan War, Palamedes of Argos was one of the most brilliant, having invented eleven letters of the alphabet or, as others say, sixteen.\n\n*What this knowledge lacks;* Now, it has been remarked, that this kind of knowledge, which is good in the sense that it provides various skills, is not enough in order to learn what may be of real advantage for each person and for the community. For lawful, just, and harmonious life in social and political relations has never been learned, and instead wronging and plotting against one another has often prevailed with terrible results even for men of knowledge. Knowledge did not save Palamedes. And in the same way as power and wealth did not save Agamemnon from being murdered or Oedipus from falling into utter ruin, knowledge and the invention of the letters could not save Palamedes from being stoned by the same men who he had instructed. For the Achaeans, they say, did not even know how to count the host, and when they had learned this from Palamedes and had themselves become clever and proficient, then they slew him.\n\n*Story of Palamedes The Oath of Tyndareus;* Because of the Oath of Tyndareus it was the duty of many rulers in Greece to join the coalition that was being formed for the purpose of sailing to Troy and obtain, either by words or by force, the restoration of Helen and the Spartan property that had been stolen by the seducer Paris.\n\n*Odysseus' reasons to avoid the war;* When the envoys Palamedes, Menelaus and Nestor, arrived to Ithaca in order to remind Odysseus of the oath he had sworn and consequently join the expedition, they met difficulties, for Odysseus had been warned by an oracle that if he went to Troy he would return home alone and in need, with his comrades lost, after twenty years. Palamedes is not tricked by Odysseus. And that is why Odysseus, not wishing to go to war, feigned madness. But Palamedes, seeing through the deception, snatched little Telemachus, Odysseus' son, from Penelope's bosom and drew his sword pretending that he would kill him. So Odysseus, fearing for his son's life, confessed that his madness was fictitious and accepted to go to war. But others say that when Odysseus learned that spokesmen would come to him, he put on a cap and, pretending madness, yoked a horse and an ox to the plow. Palamedes, they say, noticing that Odysseus was performing a farce, took his son Telemachus from the cradle and put him in front of the plow exhorting Odysseus to give up his pretence. Then Odysseus promised to join the allies, but from that time he was hostile to Palamedes, though The Oath of Tyndareus that bound him had been his Odysseus' invention as well.\n\n*Odysseus plots against Palamedes;* So having come to the front at Troy, Odysseus, never forgetting that he had been outwitted by Palamedes, kept plotting night and day against him. Some say that Odysseus compelled a Trojan prisoner to write a letter of treasonable purport, which seemed to be sent by King Priam of Troy to Palamedes, and that he dropped the letter in the camp to be found and at the same time buried gold in the quarters of Palamedes. Others have said that Odysseus, referring to a warning in a dream, convinced Agamemnon to move the Achaean camp for one day, and hid by night a great quantity of gold in the place where Palamedes' tent had been. Odysseus also gave to a Trojan prisoner a letter to be carried to King Priam, and sent a soldier of his ahead to kill him not far away from the camp. So when the army returned the next day to the camp a soldier found the letter on the body of the dead Trojan prisoner. And on it it was written: \"Sent to Palamedes from Priam\" promising him as much gold as Odysseus had hidden if he would betray the camp according to agreement.\n\n*Palamedes found guilty of treason;* This is how Palamedes lost his life through an unjust judgement. For the next day, when Palamedes was brought before Agamemnon, he denied having betrayed the army, but he was not able to convince either the king or anyone else of his innocence, after soldiers went to his tent and dug up the gold that sly Odysseus had hidden.\n\n*Palamedes' death;* And so Palamedes was stoned to death by the entire army. But others say that there was not such a plot and that Palamedes was drowned by Odysseus and Diomedes, when he put out to catch fish.\n\n*Ajax recalls the incident in Ithaca;* After Achilles' death, when Ajax and Odysseus competed for his arms, the former recalled the circumstances that forced Odysseus to come to Troy to show the judges that he was a better man and deserved the arms of Achilles: \"Shall Odysseus appear the better man who came last to arms and by feigned madness shirked the war, till one more shrewd than he...the son of Nauplius, uncovered this timid fellow's trick and dragged him forth to the arms that he shunned? Shall he take the best because he wanted to take none ? And shall I go unhonoured...just because I was the first to front the danger ?\" [Ajax. Ovid, Metamorphoses 13.34]\n\n*Palamedes' father claims satisfaction;* When Palamedes' father, Nauplius, learned that calumny and a miscarriage of justice had killed his son, he sailed to the Troad and, meeting the leaders of the Achaean army, claimed satisfaction. But all of them favoured Agamemnon, who protected Odysseus, and so Nauplius returned unsuccessful.\n\n*Contribution of Palamedes' brother;* Agamemnon did not perish at cape Caphareus, for the wind bore him to his own shores. But Oeax, in order to avenge the wrong done to his brother Palamedes, let Agamemnon's wife Clytaemnestra know that Cassandra, daughter of King Priam of Troy, was being brought as a concubine to her house. And on his arrival Agamemnon was murdered by his wife and her lover Aegisthus.\n","collection":"posts","url":"/palamedes-historical-reference/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2000-01-01-palamedes-historical-reference.md","collection":"posts","url":"/palamedes-historical-reference/","path":"_posts/2000-01-01-palamedes-historical-reference.md","id":"/palamedes-historical-reference","draft":false,"categories":[],"layout":"page","title":"Historical Reference","tags":[],"status":"publish","type":"page","private":false,"published":true,"date":"2000-01-01 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"palamedes-historical-reference","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2000-01-01-tags.md","content":"A *tag* is a (relevant) keyword or term associated with or assigned to a piece of information (a picture, a geographic map, a blog entry, a video clip etc..), thus describing the item and enabling keyword-based classification and search information.\n\nTags are usually chosen informally and personally by item author/creator or by its consumer/viewers/community.

I'd love to hear from each of the old school core posters telling everyone what the forum meant to you..  I know I personally got more out of it than I put in or I wouldn't have continued to do it..  ( and no I don't mean money -- I never made a cent.. )\n\nEither way, it was a good ride..  I want to give a personal thank you to all the users who made the forum what it was,  to the few that donated their time to upkeep as well as to the even fewer who donated money..  I also want to thank the core 50 and the hard core 20 who really provided the center around which we all revolved, you know who you are..\n\nI shall miss you all, and I wish you all the best.\n\nJason \"Palamedes\" Ellis\n<img style=\"border: 0px;\" title=\"Email Address\" src=\"/images/2008/06/email.gif\" alt=\"My Email Address\" width=\"146\" height=\"14\" />\n\n\n---\n\n###Legacy Comments\n\novjamaica - Oct 20, 2009 @ 12:40:32\n\n      To all of those I met and became friends with through the FFF, I must say a heartfelt thanks. I learned more about film production through this forum than through any other source. It’s sad to see the forum come down, but it seemed past its glory days for sure. I shall always remember the kind individuals that read my scripts, offered feedback on my effects tests, gave me advice about all kinds of topics, and listened to my own ramblings as I tried to coach others on their way to success. To all of my friends on the “other side of the pond” I want to thank you for your friendship. You darn Yanks were good friends too, and this isn’t the end of such friendships, just a change of venue. I expect to hear from all of you when you make it big.  Good luck to everyone in all that you do. If you ever need to get in touch with me, just google my name. It’s unique enough for you to find me.  Take care all.\n\n      Mike aka ovjamaica\n\nTeetee - Oct 21, 2009 @ 11:03:28\n\n      Sad and sorry we all got too busy!\n\nSpectre - Oct 21, 2009 @ 14:18:25\n\n      I’m guilty of drifting away in recent years but I always thought of the FFF as a great community of people. I’m still active in no-budget filmmaking and many of the skills and techniques that I use were learned from my friends on the board.\n\n      Jason, thanks for taking on the time and money burdens to host the board all these years. If anyone wants to keep in touch with me or collaborate on a project, please feel free to email me at kwkspectre@yahoo.com.\n\nRhino - Oct 21, 2009 @ 14:20:13\n\n      It’s a real shame but I understand the need to pull the plug. Thank you for the time, effort and of course money you invested in keeping it running, even when it began to seem not worth it. The FFF meant a lot to me, even though film making was never first on my agenda I still have an ambition to someday make a feature-length film. I learnt a lot of handy techniques and met some great friends who taught me much for when I finally realize this ambition. I went to the liberty of creating a group for all of our members on Facebook, just search for ‘Amateur Films Forum’. Hopefully we can find a way for it to carry on, in whatever form or capacity. Good luck to everyone in all your endeavours, especially film related! Take care.\n\n      Qasim aka Rhino\n\nBen (CN) - Oct 21, 2009 @ 17:52:14\n\n      Though I was only a member for about five years, they were a crucial five years, and in them I became an adult. With you people’s companionship, I grew from a fanatic blathering idiot to a nihilistic, muttering idiot, and for that I am thankful. From Utah to London, and probably some others outside my limited geographical knowledge, I made many true friends that I would not otherwise have met. They have enriched me, and, I like to think, I have enriched them even more, as I think we can all agree I was the coolest of all of us, and also the sexiest.\n\n      Except, perhaps, for Wondernerd.\n\n      With everlasting love,\n      C******** Ninja\n      CN\n      Ben\n\nDMail - Oct 23, 2009 @ 01:31:59\n\n      I was guided here from the FFF Facebook group, I hadn’t realized the forum had been taken down. I haven’t been around much in recent years, however, I grew up on the FFF. Since I was probably 12(?) I started posting on the original ezboard (none of you have any clue besides Jason), but I got to know many folks over the years and most all of them have gone on to other things since. I nearly shed a tear reading this, Jason as it occupied some 10 years of my life. Although fan films, and films in general, aren’t much of my life anymore, the films, knowledge, memories, and most of all the friends from this community will never be forgotten. Thank you all, and most importantly Jason for keeping it alive as long as you did. Feel free to add me on Facebook or whatnot.\n\n      Take care,\n      DMaul\n      Kyle\n\nNomAnor01 - Oct 23, 2009 @ 20:00:12\n\n      Been here as MysticTrunks and NomAnor for.. geez, must be 9-10 years now. Always enjoyed you guys and gals and even the only crappy SW fan stuff i tried back then. An amazing ride and great place for info from the ever famous Wondernerd.\n\n      Take care everyone and as Roland of Gilead would say, “Long days and pleasant nights to ya.”\n\n      Mike\n\nDave Macomber - Oct 23, 2009 @ 23:28:59\n\n      Wow.

I am saddend by the removal of the FFF and Hate to see it go. I remember the old ez board days when Japeth ran the place. I would be more than happy to take over the hosting and administration of the board as i have the bandwith and space to host it.\n\nJareth Dakk - Oct 26, 2009 @ 21:26:30\n\n      Well, as much as I hate to admit it, I guess you’re right, Pal. Would have loved to keep the novelization going!\n\nJbird669 - Oct 29, 2009 @ 12:59:12\n\n      I was very sad to be redirected to this page when I typed fanfilmsforum.com into my browser. I’ve made some friends and received a lot of good advice and the small amount I was able to give back hopefully helped.\n\n      Palamedes, your forum became my go-to site when other forums lost the ideals of what fan films are all about. Thanks for all of the blood, sweat, tears and cash you’ve put into the site. It’s made my writing and filmmaking better.\n\n      To the friends I’ve made, It is my sincere wish to stay in touch and hopefully collaborate on projects. While I don’t get to make as many as I’d like, I got my son involved in filmmaking, and now I’m also the VP of a film festival, thanks to the info I learned from you.\n\n      I’d love to hear from you. Drop me a line at jp@stunodpictures.com\n\nDouz - Oct 30, 2009 @ 16:25:22\n\n      Pal,\n\n      Thanks for all you have done with this board. Not only did it help in the completion of 2 SW Fan Films, but also helped us move on into the non-fan film world. Hell, you even helped point me in the right direction when I needed a board of my own for a class I was teaching. I met a lot of really good people here and wish you all the best of luck.\n\n      Scott\n\nBT - Gr'n Jalera - Oct 30, 2009 @ 17:34:18\n\n      Just found out about this. Haven’t been here in a long time but made a lot of good real life friends in the process. This site helped us to learn a lot about film making. I don’t think we could have even started our first project without this site.\n      Pal – you did an amazing thing for a long time by keeping this going, but as you said, it’s time has come.\n      Green Jello – signing off.\n\nBorjis Fett - Nov 05, 2009 @ 16:12:54\n\n      end of an era indeed!\n\n      The forum was a must visit for me daily when I began learning premiere and 3dsmax and wanted desperately to create a great fan film and hopefully lead to a job in post production….and it did. I’ve been working in the industry for 8 years now 9th coming up and its been a great career for me.\n\n      anyhoo it was a great place with great people and I’m sad that its over.\n\n      Good luck to all of you!\n      my best,\n      Chris Borges-Silva\n      Borjis Fett\n\nNetvudu - Nov 11, 2009 @ 06:41:06\n\n       (….ok.

After i got done with school I stopped doing fan film stuff for lack of time but I will never forget this place. The refuge from TFN.\n\n      Thanks Pal!\n\nAlanSmitheIII - Dec 03, 2009 @ 14:30:58\n\n      Sad to see it go…but it had become a shadow of it’s former self.\n\n      I started off with FanFilms here and on TFN….the Fan Films Golden Era. Met some people that stuck as (true) friends.\n\n      Peace out, everyone.\n\nShadow Wolf - Dec 04, 2009 @ 19:42:29\n\n      Although I hate to see it go, I must admit that my life has taken me away from the first forum I ever joined. I’ll miss you guys, and the forum.\n\n      *raises glass of cocoa*\n\n      Cheers!\n\n      Brandon (Shadow Wolf)\n\nChris - Jan 19, 2010 @ 03:26:55\n\n      Oh my gosh! I hadn’t checked the forum in a long time. I first met up with all of you when I was just a young lad. I think I was 13 or 14. I learned a lot there, and everybody really helped me enjoy video, the internet, and my youth. Such a strong community back then.\n\n      I eventually drifted away as school took more of my time and I started running around with some kids in town. Right now, though, I am in my last semester of film school at Columbia College Chicago and I think I owe all of you at least a little bit of thanks for fanning the flame when I was just starting to light the fire. You all rock!\n\n      And Jason (Pal), I still remember when you took over as the forum’s chief custodian. What an undertaking.\n\n      Y’know, when I look around today at sites like Vimeo and Youtube – sites I use often – I think back on what we were all doing and I think, really, we were a step ahead. We needed the community back then because we didn’t have the tools. Now the distribution and collaborative tools are available and communities are forming around them! It is a truly exciting time for creativity.\n\n      I invite any of you who remember me, or even those who don’t but want to get to know me, to join me on Vimeo. My profile is linked above.\n\n      I wish you all the best! I have such fond memories of our time together apart.\n\n      -Chris\n\n      (cbales)\n\nbluesh4rk - Feb 10, 2010 @ 22:56:24\n\n      Aw sad to see that FFF is no more. I myself remember the old days, they were lots of fun but life got in the way. I really had a hard time giving up Force Flicks and I can totally understand why you can’t take care of the FFF anymore. Hopefully everyone is doing well!\n\n      Jules (Joli, sh4rk, bluesh4rk)\n\nZayn - Feb 15, 2010 @ 22:09:31\n\n      I too drifted away. I got busy with life.\n\n      But I miss many of the people on here. A big chunk of you were around when I was still high school – and that was a long time ago.\n\n      Hit me up on my facebook or send me an email and I’ll let you know what I’ve been up to!\n\n      -Jen\n      Zayn_angel@hotmail.com <—this is my spam email so it might take a bit for me to reply, I'll send you my real one then\n\nSauja - Feb 16, 2010 @ 12:00:46\n\n      End of an era for sure Dave.\n\n      The enthusiasm of youth must give way to the realities of life.\n\n      It was a long ride. It was a good ride. So many laughs. So much creativity. So many dreams, some fulfilled, others not. But it was great to share those dreams with all of you. It made them seem more real.\n\n      It brings a smile to my face when I think of all the kids who have now grown up. I think of Sh4rk and Zayn, and DMaul who were mature beyond their years.\n\n      I remember the old guard. Names like Movie Maximus, Douz and G’rn, Clay, Hermes, AlanSmithee, NetVudu, Wondernerd, Melvil, SovereignKnight, Jason R.J.M., Jedi2016. (I’m forgetting so many, but google cache won’t show anything from fanfilmsforum.com and my work is blocking wayback machine).\n\n      Hats off to Japheth for creating our common home and to Palamedes for safeguarding it until now. I completely understand your decision, as sad as it makes me. (is it available in read-only mode somewhere, there was a wealth of information in those posts).\n\n      Cheers to you all. Hope you are well and happy.\n\nSauja - Feb 16, 2010 @ 19:51:48\n\n      At home I was able to have a look with web.archive.org and found a bunch of old names I’d forgotten:\n\n      Jedi_Rory, Saint Storyteller, Kreve Streak, Jedi Roara, goddess, Darth Brass, Tater, Han_Duet, Jareth Dakk and Tcheb.\n\n      Remember ScottMiddlebrook? and Dorkmanscott, and who can forget DMAN. KepowOb, and EdgeofNowhere. There was Anrev, and Bryan, and Crunchy, and sledgeweb.\n\n      I remeber Pszabo99, Xecuter666, Andrew Breecher, Jarn Tal and Khyron.\n\n      So many names. So many memories.\n\nChimi - Mar 03, 2010 @ 17:46:13\n\n      Not sure how many people here actually remember me. I kind of go way back. Back to even the ezboard days and then over to this forum. But for some reason I just figured I’d drop by and see what everyone was up to and I can honestly say I’m sad to see the board no longer in existence. I was going through my closet the other day, opening boxes of stuff from when I moved many years ago and came across my garb (X-Wing helmet and coveralls) I had purchased for the long planned, but never created Tales from the Holocron project. But anyway, hope everyone is doing well. Hello to those who remember me. Take care.\n\nJeffrey A. Haines - Mar 06, 2010 @ 14:36:37\n\n      The FFF was the first message board I ever joined! I started reading back in the ezboard days when I was just beginning to explore the world of video. I was just a kid, and it was great to interact with a community of people who all had the same budding interest.\n\n      I ended up going to college for Digital Media, and had some great experiences working with video, animation, and compositing for class projects, and on an internship where I helped to start the video program at Philly.com/The Philadelphia Inquirer. I get to create a lot of multimedia at my current job (and do some corporate video, and even some animation).\n\n      I owe a lot of who I am as a content designer today to my infancy at the FFF. I don’t think I was ever huge poster, and didn’t really get too far with the projects I was working on at the time, but I certainly learned a lot of basic film making skills, terminology, and a lot about the film making process–and a lot of other knowledge I still use almost daily.\n\n      Jason, and everyone else from the old days: Thanks for helping to facilitate such an important part of my upbringing, and for building the foundation of my career!\n\n      Jeff Haines\n      (aka Galax –I was such a huge nerd!)\n\nShmo Productions - Mar 19, 2010 @ 17:22:21\n\n      I feel like a dagger was placed into my heart and twisted. Reading these comments is WAY sad as I recall my own experience. I must have joined the forums when I was 14 just a young lad, and I learned so much stuff as I developed into a more professional videographer. It’s crazy how time has passed so fast. I’m 21 now! NUTS! Well thanks FFF.\n      and I’d like to cordially blame facebook and blogger for the death of this once great empire… Adeuix (however you spell it)\n\n      well if anyone wants to contact me. Shoot me an email hardbed34@gmail.com especially my Utah home boys! peice out!\n\nMelvil - May 01, 2010 @ 15:50:05\n\n    Wow, this was truly a difficult thing to find. I definitely understand taking the boards down, like so many others I too drifted away as my life changed, and it was always somewhat painful to see the activity decline in recent years. But like many others, this community played a huge part in my life. I couldn’t have been more than 13 or 14 when I joined, and I feel like I’ve grown up knowing a lot of you.\n\n    Many thanks to all the awesome people that made the FFF such a special place. I wish you all the very best.\n\nSledgeweb - Jun 01, 2010 @ 15:15:36\n\n    Wow, I do miss the old days. Pal, is the archive available online anywhere? I had some stuff on there I wouldn’t mind looking over again. Good times, great forum, great people! Hope you and everyone are doing well!\n\n    -Sledge\n\nJohn \"Movie Maximus\" Stratton - Jun 09, 2010 @ 14:08:18\n\n      Wow, I just got on and went to see what was up at the old forum since the last time I was here (I don’t even remember when the last time was). I’m sad to see it gone, but I can understand why.\n\n      Myself, and many others, have moved on to other things in life. I still remember the old days and the old friends, and always will.\n\n      I have a MySpace account, but rarely use it (about as often as I had been on the forum the last several years). I suppose I need to get a Facebook account one of these days, but somehow, I don’t see myself using it very much either. So many people I know are on it though, so maybe one day, just before it becomes obsolete, lol!\n\n      I just want to thank everyone who has ever been a part of the FFF over the years, you all are great friends and advisors! It was a great little corner of the internet we had for ourselves.\n\nepic movie - Aug 20, 2010 @ 10:52:17\n\n    But, this could be true, might its possible,\n\n    Well, as much as I hate to admit it, I guess you’re right, Pal.

People just don't get it. As a programmer that makes his living off the software that he writes; Its a tough thing to be stolen from in that manner. And it sucks. Most of these small time guys aren't pirating software to be mean or to be destructive, rather they are pirating it because they really like the software but can't afford to purchase it. Which in a way I guess is a compliment, but at the same time it doesn't help.. I think they are being very small minded about the whole issue and not looking at the bigger picture..\n\nOne guy says: \"There is no physical value on the bits copied to your hard disk. There is no lost revenu if I wouldn't have purchased the software anyway.\"\n\nThe problem with that statement is that he is forgetting about the thousands of man hours it takes to write that code. You forget about the employees that have to be paid by the software company long before that software is out. The phonebills, the computers bills, the office bills, maintenance, etc... Then there is the people. Programmers aint cheap man. And then there are the managers, the meetings, the HR personel, testers, lawyers, and the myriad of other things that have to be supported by this \"just code\".\n\nThere is so much physical value behind software these days that they MUST jack up the prices to pay for this stuff.. You are CLEARLY not looking at the bigger picture here..\n\nAnother fellow says: \"It doesn't take much more effort to write a program like Ultimatte than it is taking our friend [NAME OMITTED] to write the code to ALAMdv for $60 or less a copy.\"\n\nThis guy is obviously not a programmer and speaking from a stance of complete ignorance. Programming takes thousands of hours. It is repeditive, frustrating, hard, thankless and quite boring at times.\n\nWhile [NAME OMITTED] is making his software, where do you think the money comes from to pay for his living expenses? Out of his pocket.. and if he has no other software providing for that then he is steadily going broke. His software package would have to make up for that once it was finished and out on the shelves. Now yes many coders put their stuff out for free. That is a rare and wonderful thing. Many coders put their stuff out shareware HOPING to make a couple of bucks off of it. But neither case is the rule.\n\nSoftware piracy is illegal no matter how you color it. Not because companies are trying to be greedy .. but because they are trying to stay afloat. And, in the end.. any of you that are willing to pirate software from Newtek or Microsoft are just as willing to pirate from \"our friend\"..
