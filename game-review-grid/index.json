The copilot of the previous leg ( and pilot of the next leg ) of our trip let me sit in the pilots seat of the four year old 737 700.\n\nI sat there for thirty minutes talking to him about everything under the sun. Nice guy. He's an old computer nerd like me and my friends and we had a good chat. He showed me a lot of the controls for the plane and introduced me to the various screens as shown in the picture. My side is an exact mirror of what you see there. (with the exception of having a fairly competent pilot on that side. )\n\nDid you know that the 737 has pull down HUD? It was very cool. Wish I had thought to snap a couple more pics but I didn't think to take that one until just before I got up. It's odd but I felt so much better about the flight once I talked to him and found out he could have been one of us.\n\nMy friends are all now terrified of flying.. haha\n\n__Original Post__: I used to think I hated traveling in general, but the more I ponder it the more I realize that I like to travel. ... I just don't like to fly commercial.\n\nA hundred and fifty people jammed six abreast in a tiny metal tube thirty thousand feet in the air -- Not my idea of fun.\n\nSo of course, I find myself in exactly that situation.  IBM had an emergency offsite that they needed a UI developer to attend to and I was the likely (only?) choice.\n\nAnyone who knows me knows I don't like people as it is.  But put me in this situation where personal space and comfort are completely null and void and it begins to wear on my cherub like demeanor.\n\nPeople don't mean to be rude nor do they indend to bump and poke into me but some times I wonder if the stop trying on the plane.  It's almost as if folks say to themselves, \"fuck it, the isles are to small anyway so I'm gonna whack everyone as I walk past. \"\n\nSpeaking of that -- you gotta have a narrow ass to sit in these seats.  And I swear the lavatories have shrunk.  The ol'joke about the mile high club is a lie!!!  If a guy got a hard-on in there it'd push him into the isle!\n\nBut anyway.. Off I go to Boston to get yelled at by customers.  Lucky me.\n","collection":"posts","url":"/i-hate-airplanes/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2008-08-12-knowledge-when-to-use-semicolon.md","collection":"posts","url":"/knowledge-when-to-use-semicolon/","path":"_posts/2008-08-12-knowledge-when-to-use-semicolon.md","id":"/knowledge-when-to-use-semicolon","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Knowledge: When to use semicolon.","layout":"post","tags":["Educational"],"image":"/images/2009/08/124211417018024.jpg","ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x2","private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-08-12 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"knowledge-when-to-use-semicolon","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2008-08-12-i-hate-airplanes.md","excerpt":"I used to think I hated traveling in general, but the more I ponder it the more I realize that I like to travel. ...

Sometimes, the second clause doesn't really look like a complete sentence, so you must watch closely.\n\n*Example:  Twelve workers started the project; only five remain.*\n\nThere is, however, one exception that can cause you a problem. You don't use a semicolon to connect two complete sentences if there's a conjunction between the clauses (and, but, etc.). In that case, use a comma.\n\n*Example:  This could be a complete sentence, and this could be another one.*\n\nAdding that single word, the conjunction \"and,\" means that you must change that semicolon into a comma.\n\n__To Serve as a Super-comma__\n\nWhen you have a series of three or more items that normally would be separated by commas except that each individual item already has a comma in it, you use the semicolon between items.\n\n*Example:  We visited Pago Pago, Western Samoa; Curitiba, Brazil; and St. George, Utah.*\n\n*Example:  The trio's birthdays are November 10, 1946; December 7, 1947; and October 31, 1950.*\n\n*Example:  Her favorite players are Steve Young, a quarterback; Jason Buck, a defensive end; and Ty Detmer, another quarterback.*\n\nAs in the examples above, citing places, dates, and people's names with descriptions, are three very common situations where you'll see the super-comma usage.\n\n__Minor Uses__\n\nA few relatively infrequent situations also call for a semicolon. When you list three or more items tacked onto the end of a complete sentence preceded by a connector word such as \"that is,\" \"for example,\" or \"for instance,\" you may use either a comma or a semicolon. Either of the following two example sentences is correct.\n\n*Example:  Be sure to watch out for grammar errors; for instance, comma splices, run-on sentences, and dangling modifiers.*\n\n*Example:  Be sure to watch out for grammar errors, for instance, comma splices, run-on sentences, and dangling modifiers.*\n\nYou may also use a semicolon to connect two otherwise complete sentences even if they are connected by a conjunction, if the first sentence already has one or more commas in it. It's optional, but may on occasion make the sentence more understandable.\n\n*Example:  When I eat alone, I leave a mess; but that's not the worst of it.*\n\nBoth the minor uses noted above are optional, so if you can remember only the first two situations above, you'll never go wrong by putting a semicolon where it doesn't belong.\n","collection":"posts","url":"/knowledge-when-to-use-semicolon/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2008-08-12-knowledge-when-to-use-semicolon.md","collection":"posts","url":"/knowledge-when-to-use-semicolon/","path":"_posts/2008-08-12-knowledge-when-to-use-semicolon.md","id":"/knowledge-when-to-use-semicolon","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Knowledge: When to use semicolon.","layout":"post","tags":["Educational"],"image":"/images/2009/08/124211417018024.jpg","ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x2","private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-08-12 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"knowledge-when-to-use-semicolon","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2008-09-02-game-review-grid.md","content":"<img class=\"pull-right\" title=\"gridbox\" src=\"/images/2008/09/gridbox.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"130\" height=\"159\" />\n\nSo, I have always liked racing games. Grand Turismo was always my favorite franchise on the PS2 because the game was absolutely beautiful and fun to play.  However, I hated always being tied to the PS2.  I am not a big fan of console games, but it seems that our stock of racing games for PC have been fairly lack-luster.\n\nNot any more!  <a href=\"http://www.codemasters.com/grid/\" target=\"_blank\">Codemaster's, GRID</a> is a fantastic game.. Codemasters yet again earns the faith I put in them for a high quality product.. (Operation Flashpoint 2 better rule!)\nw\nOnce you get past the fact that you buy and sell cars through \"eBay Motors\" the game is quite enjoyable.. (I can't blame them for product placement.. I assume by letting Ebay, Champion, Valvoline... etc... add product placement and branding they can make the game for a lot less... Sponsors baby.. sponsors! It's not overly out of place and for the most part you don't even notice it.. )\n\nThe cars seem to drive pretty realistically and the realistic crash damage is awesome and adds a dynamic element to  the game..\n\nThe cars all move exactly as you would expect them to.  They seem to have real \"weight\" when they move which I like.  So many other car simulations just don't get it.. Codemasters really captured the feel of how a vehicle show move..\n\nOne thing I really think is a nice touch is that you can setup the game to know your real name, and as such say it when they talk to you. They recorded probably a 100 common names, both male and female as well as a bunch of nick names.. You can choose one as your \"audio name\" and when the pit crew guy talks to you via the radio he says your name.. I know that's really minor, and easy to do.. but its a nice touch and goes a long way towards immersion..\n\nSomething else I like is that it has a braking idiot light... The designers realized that they are simulating a very realistic sport, in an unrealistic medium and as such we as drivers have a hell of a lot of sensory information left completely out.. So knowing the proper time to brake for a sharp turn is often very hard to judge.. As such there is a little light in the lower left that will go green, yellow, red.. flash.. brake now you moron!!... etc.. I like that, but it needs to be right in the center of the screen.. Usually when amid 11 other cars all trying to get position and avoid crashing, its hard to notice..\n\nThe game does have an EXCELLENT multiplayer game..  Nothing more fun that doing race after race with other folks over the web.  The only real issue is that most people like running derby after derby and that gets told to me.. Also online game play being what it is, you do get quite a lot of douche bags who don't know how to do anything other than type \"fuck\" or \"nigger\" over and over again.. *sigh*  But so long as you can tune them out, its pretty fun.\n\nAt this point my only real complaint is that you MUST have a wheel.. trying to play this game with the keys (no mouse driving at all) is impossible or at least very hard with any accuracy.. (which makes sense.. I mean there is a good reason we drive with big analog wheels and not digital keys..)  So, having said that it's a completely invalid complaint but one that I figured I would voice.  I mean its a driving game after all, a wheel isn't out of the ordinary in the extremely rare situation of being in control of a car..\n\nWhen trying to drive with the keyboard the wheels, brakes and accelerator are either FULL ON, FULL OFF, FULL LEFT, or FULL RIGHT which makes for sporadic driving at best.\n\nI have 2 good wheels for my Playstation 2 but they don't use USB plugs so now I have to go buy a new wheel.. A little annoyed by that, but so be it.. I like racing games that much so I went out and got the R660 GT Motorsport racing wheel which I'll try to write a review about..  Some folks on the community grid forums can't get it to work with the game at all, but I'm having no troubles..\n\nWish list wise; I wish the game would actually make you pay for the damage you do to your car.. right now you can buy a 10 million dollar vehicle, total it.. and fixing it is free.. It shouldn't be.. but what can ya do.. this is really minor all things considered..\n\nThe reason this is important is because otherwise you can play the game as one bug crash derby and get away with it..\n\nI also wish you had more control over things like tire selection, engine tunings..etc.. That stuff is completely left out of the game.\n","collection":"posts","url":"/game-review-grid/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2008-09-15-windows-xp-sp3-access-denied.md","collection":"posts","url":"/windows-xp-sp3-access-denied/","path":"_posts/2008-09-15-windows-xp-sp3-access-denied.md","id":"/windows-xp-sp3-access-denied","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Windows XP Sp.3 ... \"Access Denied!\"","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2008/09/software.png","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-09-15 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"windows-xp-sp3-access-denied","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2008-09-02-game-review-grid.md","excerpt":"So, I have always liked racing games.

(I'm paraphrasing.)\n\nThey give instructions on how to fix it, then below the instructions they say that they aren't responsible if these instructions don't work.  Awesome..  Gotta love good customer support on top of a huge snafu.\n\nTo save you the trouble, here are the steps to fix it;\n\n* <a href=\"http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756/\" target=\"_blank\">Backup your registry.</a>\n* <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=e8ba3e56-d8fe-4a91-93cf-ed6985e3927b&amp;displaylang=en\" target=\"_blank\">Download Microsofts Subinacl.</a>\n* <a href=\"/images/2008/09/reset.cmd\" target=\"_blank\">Download this file and double click it.</a>\n* <a href=\"http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322389/\" target=\"_blank\">Install Service Pack 3 from the FULL install.</a>\n\nIt works.  Step 1 is vital just in case, 2 is a microsoft tool that enables the script that is step three.  Step three is just what passes for a shell script, feel free to read it via notepad.  Also, step three takes about 10 minutes to run so go have a coke and a smile.\n\n I had actually been considering installing Vista just to test out DX10 on a different partition, now screw that.  Install Vista? Accept/Deny... Denied.\n\nGame developers please.. start releasing your games for Linux..  Let's make Microsoft shape up or get the hell out of the market..\n","collection":"posts","url":"/windows-xp-sp3-access-denied/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2008-09-15-windows-xp-sp3-access-denied.md","collection":"posts","url":"/windows-xp-sp3-access-denied/","path":"_posts/2008-09-15-windows-xp-sp3-access-denied.md","id":"/windows-xp-sp3-access-denied","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Windows XP Sp.3 ... \"Access Denied!\"","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2008/09/software.png","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-09-15 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"windows-xp-sp3-access-denied","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2008-10-28-game-review-farcry-2.md","content":"<img title=\"farcry2pc\" src=\"/images/2008/10/farcry2pc-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" class='pull-right' />\n\nOpen world game play is all the rage.  The industry has decided that linear is out and that open ended randomness is in!  The issue being of course that it detracts from the over all story and game play something awful.. of course gameplay also appears to be out right now, so no big loss ... but I get ahead of myself..\n\nOver the weekend I picked up Farcry 2.  I wasn't on the original Farcry boat.. For whatever reason that game came and went long before I ever saw it.  When I finally did get my grubby hands on it, I had just played HL2 and was jonesing for some extra action.. needless to say it didn't do much for me..   But I could see the potential!  And certainly why it was thought of as awesome.. It was still pretty good for an older game..\n\nNow that Farcry 2 is out I was one of the first ones on the band wagon.  I downloaded the game from direct2drive and had it installed and playing in fairly short order.\n\nOnce I got the game installed I promptly... logged into World of Warcraft... my wife wanted me to play with her.  But once that was done I played some Farcry 2!\n\nThe initial opening sequences were pretty neat and the game looked like it had some promise in the vein of direction and fun.  Wow was I ever wrong.\n\nAfter several hours of game play I have a long list of complaints.  More over it's very obvious to me that they were more interested in making the game engine look pretty than making a game that is fun to play.\n\nIt really seems like the they were entirely too determined to make their game engine as pretty as the crysis engine, game play be damned.  And I believe they have done so, the graphics engine is wonderful guys, but so many of the other portions of the game lack.\n\nThe folks at UBI were all keen on making sure you knew this game was going for ultra realism!  And yet again, a long line of games have fallen far short of that goal.  I really wish they would stop trying.  Simulating realism in a game is impossible especially when the controls are a mouse and keyboard.\n\nOR a game pad controller which is exactly all they were aiming for.\n\nI really hate what console gaming is doing to the PC gaming market.  Trying to make 1 game that works 100% with PCs and Consoles is fine, but why do you make the PC gamers suffer with the limited controls?\n\n__Securom DRM__ -- Firstly a word about securom;  Farcry 2 uses the same shitty DRM model that spore uses, and just like spore and all other games that use it, only serves to piss off and thus on the legit users who actually bought the game.   I maintain that any user who was going to hack the game would hack it anyway and companies aren't making any money by adding all this anti-piracy code that intentionally rootkits legit users computers.   To the entire industry I say, fuck you.  Stop it!  You are only spending extra money on something that is only serving to kill your industry..  The bloody system was hacked weeks before you even brought it out..  So far the only people that your DRM is preventing from playing the game, are the ones that legitimately bought the game!   I don't know why I bother, this is yet another example of the game executives being fucking morons and refusing to listen to their customers.  Shocker.  The state of the PC gaming industry can be traced directly back to your poor decisions.\n\n__No Prone / No Lean__ -- I mean seriously.  Why can't I go prone or lean left / right around corners?  This is basic first person shooter 101 stuff and in the vein of realism seems kinda important..  the answer of course is because console gamers have no button for that.. so PC gamers must suffer too.. Serously lame.\n\n__Destructable Environments__ -- In the video and various other sources they talked about how the entire world would be destructable.. and nothing is.  You can shoot the hood off a car, or burn a building..etc..  Stuff will come flying at you etc.. but in the end the building is exactly as it was.   You can shoot the leaves off a bush, but not chop them off.. etc..   In the end nothing is really destructable.. Lame.\n\n__Somali's are uber!__ -- Why the hell does every 90lb Somali guy take 10 or 12 bullets to the chest before falling down?  ... only to get up and crawl away as if nothing happened.  I mean seriously these guys are fricken uber as hell..  It's rediculous how much damage they take before dying..  This is lame.\n\n__There he is! Get him!__ -- Every NPC in the game upon getting a glimps of you (oh and they WILL see you) just starts shooting.  No questions asked.  Why do they open fire on you no matter what?!  Do I have a big blinking sign \"bad guy here\" over my head?  This is lame as hell..\n\n__Windy as hell__ -- The realtree system that the engine employ's looks fantastic, but at one point the wind was blowing so damn hard it would have been a hurricane.. Huge thick trunked trees were whipping back and forth in such an unrealistic manner that it really detracted from the game..  Cap the winds guys..\n\n__Instant Respawn and drive times__ -- The game is massively open, and as such you have to drive from one point to another during missions.  It takes ages to get there and the vehicles drive like shit.  They very much feel like a cardboard box, not a real vehicle.  But fine, that can be forgiven.  More over, I'm okay with the openess of the game, but to keep things interesting they have placed ambush points in the form of guardposts on every fricken road between any two points.   In order to get to your mission you'll likely have to drive through 5 or 6 of them and it's a full on fight every time.   Which again, fine.    But they respawn to full strength pretty much instantly.    Why?!   Combine that with the fact that they are uber, nothing is destructable, they see you and open fire instantly..etc..  you get the point.\n\nFrankly it's just rediculous that they respawn so quickly, it's tedious and irritiating and servies no purpose but to piss me off.  The placed it there to keep the game from getting boring.. well this only exacerbated the problem not fix it.\n\nAll in all, the game kinda sucks.  It's not fun.  It's flat, lifeless and plainly dull because you end up having to do the same bullshit over and over again with out any real story or ties to some kind of story line.  It has none of the immersion that UBI claims is there.\n\nIn the end, I'm sadly disappointed.  I'll likely keep playing it a bit just to make sure, then ditch it for good.\n","collection":"posts","url":"/game-review-farcry-2/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2008-10-30-jack-tompson-has-been-disbarred.md","collection":"posts","url":"/jack-tompson-has-been-disbarred/","path":"_posts/2008-10-30-jack-tompson-has-been-disbarred.md","id":"/jack-tompson-has-been-disbarred","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Jack Tompson has been disbarred","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-10-30 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"jack-tompson-has-been-disbarred","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2008-10-28-game-review-farcry-2.md","excerpt":"Open world game play is all the rage.
