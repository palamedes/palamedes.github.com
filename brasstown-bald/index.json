I take umbrage with what frameworks like wordpress and jquery have done to us.  On the one hand they are great tools that serve a purpose and fill a need, but on the other you have a whole generation of people who have only ever learned how to use them and don't understand the underlying technology.. At all. \n\nAt GROK, we are interviewing \"developers\" and trying to find that right hire.  But the number of folks that have come forward claiming to be PHP experts have apparently really only ever worked with wordpress and as such have virtually zero understanding of PHP as a language.  How can you call yourself a PHP expert and not understand the object model? Or even what an object is in a couple cases.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the folks who say they know jquery and are an expert with it, but also say they don't know javascript... What?! That doesn't even make sense.. \n\nThat's like someone saying they are an accountant who is an expert at quickbooks, but that they don't understand basic accounting..  \n\nThe real tragedy is that these folks are able to get 85k to 120k jobs with their paltry skills and think its completely reasonable to expect to get more when they move on.   I think they are setting themselves up for an incredible fall.\n\nI have done a number of interviews now with different folks and while some of them were knowledgeable and good, some were embarrassingly bad.  \n\nMy interview style is rough but friendly.  It's no where near as bad as some of the pressure cooker/shark tanks I have been to in my day, but I expect you to know what you say you know at the level you say you know it.  \n\nIf I ask you what your PHP skill is 0 to 10 and you tell me 10, I'm gonna ask you questions that I would expect only Rasmus Lerdorf to know.   It stuns me how many people claim to be a 9 or 10, when they aren't even a 3..  This is what wordpress has done to us..  Same thing happens with javascript and jquery or any of the myriad of other frameworks out there. \n\nI realize we all have to start somewhere, but quite a lot of these people think they are senior developers when they wouldn't even qualify as a junior one.\n\nDo yourself a favor, learn the underlying technology.  Ask yourself; 'Why does this work?' \n\nA Javascript expert should be able to create their own jquery from scratch.  I'm not saying they should, just that they understand how it works and why it works and could if they needed to.  There's no mystery to it to them, it's just a tool.\n\nA PHP expert should be able to write wordpress from scratch.  etc..  (Come to think of it, a true PHP expert would look at the wordpress source and shudder.. )\n\nWhen your software goes from 'magic' to just another tool in your toolbox that you fully understand, then you can call yourself an expert.  Until then, you have some learning to do.\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2013-12-06-price-of-software.md","url":"/price-of-software/","relative_path":"_posts/2013-12-06-price-of-software.md","id":"/price-of-software","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Software Development"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Software Development Costs","layout":"post","tags":["Costs"],"image":"/images/2013/12/software-development-costs.jpg","gallery":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"tile_class":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2013-12-06 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"price-of-software","ext":".md"},"url":"/state-of-industry/","relative_path":"_posts/2013-12-10-state-of-industry.md","id":"/state-of-industry","collection":"posts","excerpt":"When your software goes from 'magic' to just another tool in your toolbox that you fully understand, then you can call yourself an expert.

In fact, I don't work at any job that is minimum wage or there abouts because in my opinion, it's not a livable wage.  And, to be completely honest, I don't understand how people manage to live on so little income.\n\nInstead, I chose a career path that requires a lot of technical knowledge and skill in order to stay competitive in the industry and that pays well enough that I can continue to live the lifestyle I enjoy.\n\nPart of my job is to entertain offers for work from prospective clients. This typically includes hours (often days) of communication, information gathering, research, and other unbillable time that I have to put in for them before I get paid a dime.\n\nThe ultimate goal of which is to divide up the work with the intent of putting hourly and iterative work totals to their software desire which gives them a cost estimate for the work they want done.   \n\nThis is the only part of my job I hate.  I hate it because all clients want the sky, the moon, and stars -- for free or very little money and scoff and demand to know why we are 'so expensive'.  \n\nWe aren't - In fact I know a lot of firms that charge a lot more than we do.  We are realistic.\n\nAn example prospective client hit us up today with a 20 page document (small type!) full of all the requirements that had to be met in order for us to be complete, had less than 3 months to do the work, and wanted the whole shebang for $10,000.   All the while bemoaning the previous developers that offered to do the work for that amount but who were unresponsive. \n\n(I will admit that having such thorough document to talk to is great!  Many clients show up with nothing but a dream only to have their hopes dashed when we start asking hard questions that they don't have answers to.  Define your product, or we can help you define it.  But if I define it, it will be an MVP/POC first and iterate into a full blown product.  This is a topic for a different post though.)\n\nBut the common thread is that no matter the scope of the work, they always think we are too expensive and quite often expect to pay less than half or even a quarter of what is reasonable. \n\nFor example; The $10k job above would have required at least two full time developers to get it done within the 3 month deadline, if it's even possible to make the deadline without working a lot of overtime.  But assuming its possible to get it done in the time allotted; $10k divided by roughly 60 days, at 8 hours a day, for 2 developers ends up being just above $10 an hour over the life of the project and that's before taxes.  \n\nNot a livable wage.  A plumber makes more.\n\nI didn't spend the last 20+ years getting experience in my industry and spending an unconscionable amount of extra time becoming an expert to work for so little. It requires a lot of time, effort and energy on my part to stay current and competitive in my industry so I have very little patience with people who think I get paid too much money for what I do. \n\nSorry, but anyone who says software engineers and architects get paid too much, don't understand what it takes to do what we do.\n\nI think the issue is most people just see the initial number and think its a lot.   On the surface, $10k is a lot of money.  And if I were given $10k for doing nothing then I'd be happy as a clam.\n\nMost people have no concept the amount of work, time, and effort that goes into writing software and as such they can't really fathom it.  Because they can't wrap their mind around it and because there is nothing physical to put value to, it's very easy to think that they are paying us that $10k for nothing and that we should be just happy as a clam for being offered it.\n\nIt pains me to have to be the one to explain to them that this isn't the case.  The problem comes when you have those people that are actually offended by the amount I say it would actually require in order to pull their dream off.   I'm usually looked at as a greedy bastard and thought of as a criminal.\n\nMost firms would charge closer to $100k for that 3 month job.  See what I mean?  You scoffed a little didn't you.\n\nAnd I'm just talking about the initial development cost.  Not maintenance fees, server hardware, data storage fees, design costs, testing costs etc..  \n\nThe problem with going with the $10k firm versus the $100k firm is that you get what you pay for.  The perceived value is in dollars only, without any thought or consideration to the quality of the work being done or the support you're going to get before start, during development and after completion.  (We give 6 months of bugfixes for free.)\n\nThey have already approached $10k firm for the product and they don't like the support / communication they were getting (read: the firm has just disappeared because 10k for this project is too low), so why are they looking for another $10k firm that will likely give them the exact same results?  \n\nYou get what you pay for and people some how refuse to learn that lesson with software.  \n\n\n\n\n\n","previous":{"next":{"path":"_posts/2013-12-06-price-of-software.md","url":"/price-of-software/","relative_path":"_posts/2013-12-06-price-of-software.md","id":"/price-of-software","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Software Development"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Software Development Costs","layout":"post","tags":["Costs"],"image":"/images/2013/12/software-development-costs.jpg","gallery":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"tile_class":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2013-12-06 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"price-of-software","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2013-09-15-brasstown-bald.md","output":null,"content":"The wife and I hiked up to the top of Brasstown bald last weekend, and I snapped some photos..

I have the [MLT13 Clock](/scroll-saw-and-mlt-13-wooden-clock) up on the wall in my garage and it \"mostly\" works.  Seriously it's so close!  It just wont stay ticking, and then the move caused some of the joints to swell a little so it needs work.  (Humidity + Wood == Movement)\n\nThe issue with the MLT13 is that it was likely a bit more challenging than I realized and wasn't a good first clock project primarily because the escapement is fairly small.  I have recut the both the escape wheel and the pallets a number of times and still not gotten it 100% correct.  Either the tolerances are extremely tight or I just don't have a clue how to tune it.\n\nIt will \"tick\" for 5 or 6 seconds then stop with a bind in the escapement, or the escapement will spin free a couple times causing the pallets and excapement to get out of beat which throws everything off.. Either way, it's just off and I need to perfect an escapement if I am to have any hope of creating a working clock.\n\nSo to that end, my goal is to make just an escapement. A working demo that is just the \"heartbeat\" of a clock, with out all the extra stuff to tell time.  Baby steps.  This will be my minimum viable product and proof of concept, so-to-speak.\n\nI have researched all manner of different escapements and man there are a lot of them, but I knew I wanted an escapement that didn't necessarily require a hanging pendulum.  This narrowed down my list of options quite a bit and really left me with only one that I think will do the trick;  [The grasshopper escapement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grasshopper_escapement)\n\nIt looks very complex but it actually isn't that bad.  You can see how it moves in the gif.\n\nI started creating the escape gear below with the intent of making a 30 tooth escape wheel just like the gif had.. Took lots of measurements, made some plans, created a jig to help make my main escape gear and sure enough!  29 teeth... Damn it!  haha  Math is hard!\n\nAn unfortunate mistake but not an unrecoverable one.  Again this isn't supposed to be a working clock, just a working escapement.\n\nSo there ya go, the first two images are the jig and the finished glue-up without the covering wheel.\n\nTomorrow, I cut the various gear teeth down to size and shape them to look more like the gif.","previous":{"path":"_posts/2013-08-25-banjo-clock-its-alive.md","url":"/banjo-clock-its-alive/","relative_path":"_posts/2013-08-25-banjo-clock-its-alive.md","id":"/banjo-clock-its-alive","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Hobbies"],"published":"trie","type":"post","title":"Banjo Clock: It's Alive!","layout":"post","tags":["Wood Working"],"image":"/images/2013/08/banjoclock01.jpg","gallery":["/images/2013/08/banjoclock01.jpg"],"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"tile_class":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2013-08-25 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"banjo-clock-its-alive","ext":".md"},"url":"/grasshopper-escapement/","relative_path":"_posts/2013-08-31-grasshopper-escapement.md","id":"/grasshopper-escapement","collection":"posts","excerpt":"I started creating my main escape gear measured it to have 30 teeth and made a jig to help.
