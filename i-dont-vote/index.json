Martin has done a masterful job of creating an extremely suspenseful story full of political intrigue, action and hard core drama.\n\nOriginally released back in 1997 I some how missed this story until now..  At this point, it includes 4 books and I'm part way through the second one.. So far it appears to be a fantastic continuation of the first book beginning exactly where the first book left off as if it were one long book.. Yay!   It's good.. It's damn good..  The authors voice and the depth of the characters make it so..\n\nI highly recommend it.  <a href=\"http://search.barnesandnoble.com/A-Game-of-Thrones/George-R-R-Martin/e/9780553573404/?itm=2&amp;USRI=game+of+thrones#TABS\" target=\"_blank\">Clickie to Barnes and Nobles</a>\n\nAt this point I have only one complaint, and that's the eReader version appears to have a lot of typos.. Some are quite jarring.. But you can easily ignore them.. Or if you get the paper/hard back you wont have this problem..\n\n5/5 from me.. Good work George..\n\nApparently they are making the series into an HBO special in 2011..  It better be good!\n","collection":"posts","url":"/book-review-a-game-of-thrones/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2010-10-11-portal-2-looks-so-awesome.md","collection":"posts","url":"/portal-2-looks-so-awesome/","path":"_posts/2010-10-11-portal-2-looks-so-awesome.md","id":"/portal-2-looks-so-awesome","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Portal 2 looks so awesome... *gleeeee*","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2010/10/Wallpaper01_iPhoneLockScreen-e1286852221988-150x150.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2010-10-11 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"portal-2-looks-so-awesome","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2010-09-26-book-review-a-game-of-thrones.md","excerpt":"I don't normally do book reviews but this book was so good I had to make an exception..   This book is easily some of the best candy I have had in a long time...","id":"/book-review-a-game-of-thrones","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Book Review: A Game of Thrones","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2010/09/30652075.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2010-09-26 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"book-review-a-game-of-thrones","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2010-10-11-portal-2-looks-so-awesome.md","content":"<img title=\"Portal 2\" class='pull-right' src=\"/images/2010/10/Wallpaper01_iPhoneLockScreen-e1286852221988-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Portal 2\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" />\n\nSo I am a HUGE fan of Portal.. It was quite possibly one of the best 3 hour games I have ever played.. I mean, it was absolutely genius..  It a first person physics puzzle that walked this amazingly fine line of comedic darkness that kept you thinking, and laughing..\n\nThe only negative feedback anyone ever was able to come up with was how short it was.. When I say its a 3 hour game.. I mean it, it's a 3 hour game..  Even going slow you should be able to solve it in that amount of time..  You can eek out a couple extra hours of fun by doing the bonus levels or trying to get all the achievements but that's really it..\n\nThat was a tad disappointing, but Valve knew they were on to something and started working on the next installment almost immediately..\n\nAnd I have to say, holy crap.. it looks amazing..  Check out all the videos over at <a href=\"http://thinkwithportals.com/\" target=\"_blank\">http://thinkwithportals.com/</a>\n\nI couldn't help but sit here giggling with the pure liquid awesomeness that is the coming game.. It looks so good!   I got so excited I played through the first game again..\n\nAnd btw, if you haven't played Portal yet.. You should.. It costs $19 on Steam and is worth every penny!  yes it's only a 3 hour game, but still it's so fun you'll likely play it several times.. I know I have...\n","collection":"posts","url":"/portal-2-looks-so-awesome/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2010-10-11-portal-2-looks-so-awesome.md","collection":"posts","url":"/portal-2-looks-so-awesome/","path":"_posts/2010-10-11-portal-2-looks-so-awesome.md","id":"/portal-2-looks-so-awesome","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Portal

general rule, I don't vote.  I don't vote, and it's my right to do so.  Leave me alone.  Stop harassing me with mindless slogans and social pressure.  I don't want to be bothered by it, I don't have to be bothered by it, I won't be bothered by it.\n\nThe common sense rhetoric that often follows my making that statement is that if I don't vote, then I shouldn't complain or that \"bad officials are sent to govern where good people don't vote\".. etc..\n\nI disagree.  I maintain that voting in ignorance of the issues or the people and their policies is worse that voting at all..\n\nI don't vote because I know myself to not be educated as to the various parties, stances, issues..etc.  And that you by voting, have in fact gone out of your way to educate yourself, as opposed to voting from a stance of ignorance..  So if you vote badly, then I can complain about your poor choice.. =)  I say this facetiously but there's a hint of truth to it..\n\nEither way I am very tired of the often attempted guilt inducing slogans and verbiage that voters feel is their right to spout at those who choose to abstain..  The very notion that those who refrain from voting are often the ones to blame, or that some how by not acting as an agent for one party or another makes you an agent for the other side is pure shenanigans..\n\nSome might wonder why I don't go out of my way to educate myself as to the issues and the people so that I can offset the ignorant..etc..  I don't vote for a number of reasons but the primary one is because I'm completely disillusioned with the system and because I am tired of trying to sift through the reams and volumes of lies and bullshit to get to the nugget of truth that an individual should use to cast their ballot..\n\nI really believe the system is broken.  It's not because I'm lazy or that I simply don't care.  If I didn't care, I wouldn't be writing this.  I just don't like how things are working right now and am voicing my right to not \"pick the lesser of two evils\" and I don't feel in the least bit guilty about this..  I have made a choice to not make a choice, and that's okay.\n\nSee the whole voting process is based on the notion that we are all equal and that we all get to turn in one ballot, and those votes should all be treated equally with no exception because we are all educated on the issues and policies.  Sounds great!  But its completely unrealistic.  Gone are the days were it was even possible to know all the candidates, or the issues.  It's simply not possible.\n\nThis very system means that someone who is so stupid as to not know the Earth revolves around the Sun, or that evolution actually happened has the power to negate your carefully considered opinion just because some bumper sticker or social pressure guilted him into going out and voting.\n\nSo with one swift stroke, or a flip of a switch this uneducated person (who has no idea what or who they are voting for) has the power to enact through their vote legislation that will now affect you.\n\nI agree that individuals should have the right to vote, and that they should do so with an educated view of the outcome, but the masses are so far from being \"in the know\" that it breaks the system down, and that's exactly where the government wants you.   The government wants you to believe that by choosing one or the other bad candidate you're in charge and making a difference!  Crock of shit.\n\nPolitics any more is about who can out lie the other, who can put on the best face and look good on TV.  How many TV ads start with one political jack monkey bashing another one in order to prove he's the best.  That's broken.  If the only way one candidate can differentiate himself from another is to bash and badmouth, then he has nothing worth having and he's already lost.  What happens though when they all do it?  Who do you vote for when they all suck?\n\nMore over,  I really believe one vote doesn't matter, doesn't make a difference..  If Candidate A had 23.012345% of the vote before I voted, and 23.012346% of the vote after I voted it makes no difference.  No news outlet reports that many decimal points.. The simply truth is that one vote has no value and I can prove it to you;\n\nIf my vote is such a big deal I'll tell ya what, I'll sell you my vote.   I'm pretty sure I can get a mail ballot and send it to you so that you can vote as me..  You can vote for anything you want..  That's pretty cool right?  Suddenly you could double your voting potential!\n\nHow much is my vote worth to you?  How much money are you willing to send to me in order to get this \"precious commodity\"?   yeah I thought so..\n\nUltimately though, it's my right.  I served in the US Army and after words as a Police Officer to ensure your freedoms and mine.  I choose, to not choose.\n","collection":"posts","url":"/i-dont-vote/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2010-11-05-game-review-star-wars-the-force-unleashed-2.md","collection":"posts","url":"/game-review-star-wars-the-force-unleashed-2/","path":"_posts/2010-11-05-game-review-star-wars-the-force-unleashed-2.md","id":"/game-review-star-wars-the-force-unleashed-2","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Game Review: Star Wars The Force Unleashed 2","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2010/11/tfu2_dated.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2010-11-05 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"game-review-star-wars-the-force-unleashed-2","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2010-11-02-i-dont-vote.md","excerpt":"So as a general rule, I don't vote.  I don't vote, and it's my right to do so.  Leave me alone.  Stop harassing me with mindless slogans and social pressure.

Not great.. Certainly not as good as a native PC game, but not terribad.\n\nNow lets talk about the cons;\n\nThe camera system.  The gameplay.. The gameplay and uh.. the gameplay!!\n\nFirst lets talk about the camera system..   Whoever the asshat was that thought it was a good idea to decouple the camera system from the players perspective and force you to control the character from whatever fucked up camera angle they wanted to throw at you for any given instance, needs to be kicked in the balls while being garroted by a hairy sweaty man using a live eel..  And then shot.\n\nThe camera system makes this game nearly unplayable as you don't look in the direction you're going!!  No no you look in whatever direction either your mouse was looking at previously OR (and this is by far worse) whatever fixed camera position they want you in for that particular scene..\n\nIt makes controlling your character impossible.  This is something that does NOT translate well from a console game to a PC game.  It only serves to piss people off,  so stop it!\n\nBut that's not the worst part.  No no.\n\nThe worst part is the game play in which they decide every few minutes to throw a quicktime event at you..  For those of you that are unfamiliar with quick time events they go something like this.. PUSH E NOW!   Oh too late... You died.. Start over.\n\nThe next time it will be some other random control you have to do at exactly the right or you fail it!   Plus, the correct control request is displayed at various spots around the screen instead of in the same place..  So you never know whats coming, when.. or for how long..etc..\n\nThis shit made for crappy game play 20 years ago in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon%27s_Lair\" target=\"_blank\">Dragon's Lair</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Ace\" target=\"_blank\">Space Ace</a>, and it makes for crappy game play today..  It's cheap and easy for the programmers so that's why they do it.. Not because it's fun.. I can't understand how console gamers like this crap but clearly they do or they wouldn't do it..\n\nNow.. Combine those two issues and you begin to understand why I had to stop playing every few minutes to wipe the projectile scream-spittle off my monitor..\n\nYou can't see where you're going or what you're doing because you're stuck in their camera angle and you have to perform some bullshit quick time event that borders on the impossible..\n\nI got to the Gorgon scene (or whatever the big god of war style beasty is in the arena is called) tried it about 20 times and uninstalled the game.    It pissed me off bad enough trying to lock his arms in to the shackles but really pissed me off the next part where they throw an awkward camera angle at you followed by a fucked up quick time event and don't explain at all what you're supposed to do..Done.\n\nThis game is shit.  Lucas Arts should hang their head as it does nothing to foster good memories about the franchise, it's a painful game that isn't fun what so ever..\n\nI'll give it 1 star for being pretty and half a star for actually not doing a bad job converting the controls to PC.. but the gameplay and camera system sink it completely.\n","collection":"posts","url":"/game-review-star-wars-the-force-unleashed-2/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2010-11-05-game-review-star-wars-the-force-unleashed-2.md","collection":"posts","url":"/game-review-star-wars-the-force-unleashed-2/","path":"_posts/2010-11-05-game-review-star-wars-the-force-unleashed-2.md","id":"/game-review-star-wars-the-force-unleashed-2","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Game Review: Star Wars The Force Unleashed 2","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2010/11/tfu2_dated.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2010-11-05 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"game-review-star-wars-the-force-unleashed-2","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2010-11-13-game-review-call-of-duty-black-ops.md","content":"<img title=\"Black-Ops\" class='pull-right' src=\"/images/2010/11/Black-Ops-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Black-Ops\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" />\n\nI really do enjoy the Call of Duty franchise..  It started out as a PC shooter back in 2003 and was pretty much heralded as the game to be or beat..  They continued with expansion after expansion and broadened their horizons to other machines.   At this point the franchise spans something like 15 to 20 titles on 5 or 6 different platforms earning more than $3 billion dollars world wide, and even includes it's own line of action figures..    However their latest offering is down right bad and they should hang their head a little..\n\nMore over, for a game that started on the PC one would think they would give it more love than they do.. At this point the PC version of the latest game is completely unplayable by a large portion of the market, myself included and some how that seems okay to them.\n\nIt really seems the zero day patch system that just about all software manufacturers use is starting to get out of hand..  Whats that you ask?   Well it goes something like this;  Marketing and business have the game release date firmly set because that's what they have promised share holders.    This is a firm date and it can't move.   Period.\n\nProduct architects and management continue to shoe-horn in last minute features that they think would be cool or because users want them or because they fit some \"vision\", and expect that date they set above to not slip at all..    So it's up to the developers to squeeze out the product in a completely unreasonable amount of time..\n\nPrior to that magical date, there is another magical date when the product goes gold.. At gold (or dcut or whatever they call it) they cut a copy of the program and send it to test.  If it passes the most basic of verification tests they go on and send it to print where it gets put to disks and / or packaged up to be shipped to the user.\n\nTest continues to file defects and report problems to the developers and the developers are still working to fix those bugs..  But everyone knows that the software is full of bugs when it first goes gold and gets shipped to the customer..  Management and Marketing accepts this as \"how it is\", and usually fails to tell the shareholders it works this way..  So they are fully aware of how broken the product is, in order to meet that magical ship date..\n\nThey are just hoping like hell that once the game is installed it will automatically download the latest patch (the zero day patch) which will fix all the bugs that the game shipped with..\n\nBut that begs the question;  What happens when you willingly and knowingly ship a broken product hoping for that zero day patch, but that zero day patch isn't ready in time?  Or the zero day patch doesn't do anything to address the issues people are seeing?\n\nThis is whats going on with black ops..  There was a zero day patch (shocker) and it didn't do anything that I can tell, or at the very best brought it from a completely broken state to now just an unreasonably broken state for a game we paid $60 in order to play..\n\nThe real pisser is that companies know that we have zero recourse..  We have no way to get that money back..  I paid for a game, and it doesn't work.. and I have no recourse..   Imagine if you purchased a toaster from walmart and it just didn't do anything.. you could take it back, and have a reasonable expectation of getting your money back.   Not here;  And they know it..  They bank on it..\n\nBottom line is the game is broken for a large number of folks and they don't care.. One of the devs via his twitter account stated as much..  Instead talking about the 85k people playing right at that moment..\n\nAs of Nov 2009 the call of duty franchise sold more than 55 million units, and they think just because a paltry 85k can play the game it's okay?   Plus they have no idea how well those 85k are able to play.. I can play the game for a few minutes here and there, but it crashes or lags to a stop..etc.. Sure I was playing it but it wasn't playable.. Am I one of those 85k they are so proud of?\n\nSingle player gets laggy and stuttery while playing it but usually it's still somewhat playable, frustrating as hell, but playable.. where as multiplayer is so bad it's completely not worth trying to play..\n\nI was able to get the game to play once I turned all graphics to the minimum settings, lowered the screen resolution to something ridiculously low, and played it in a window..  THEN it's \"playable\" (I use the term loosely)..  My CPU is still hammered though..  My GPU is bored when I do this.. It almost acts like they aren't using GPU acceleration maybe?   I really don't know..\n\nThe game is unreasonably broken..  It's 100% CPU bound in that they  did virtually zero optimization on the code or left the debug code going  or aren't using GPU acceleration or something..  My quad core pegs all 4 cores to 100% while playing and  my machine while older is no slouch..\n\nIt often loses save games just out of the blue.. I got half way through the game, went to get something to eat.. came back to continue after having continued before only to have a \"New Campaign\" option.. My resume game options were all gone..  So great.. I got half way through to have to go half way through again?!  Fuck that..  This is the point when I started to fight with multiplayer..\n\nThe servers list is completely broken in multiplayer in that it often doesn't update.. or refuses to stop updating once it starts.. or you can't connect to a server at all.. or it doesn't even try to connect..\n\nOnce connected it stutters to a stop constantly.. Not network lag either this is an internal lockup of some sort.. My ping usually doesn't go above 50..  DirectX crashes, random crashes to desktop, jerky stuttery video.. etc..  It's just unplayable and not fun..\n\nIt's also pretty clear to  me that even though they list a minimum spec computer that can run the  game, they never actually tried that themselves as a lot of folks on the  forums who don't have the latest Intel i7 QuadCore Super Rig simply  can't play it..\n\nUltimately, I'm severely disappointed..  I really expected a hell of a lot more out of them..\n\nI can play COD:World at War on max graphics using my one graphics card to span 3 monitors and it works fine.. Yet this game wont work at all on the same PC?   It's not my machine..\n\nAnd by their responses, I guess COD is no longer the franchise for me..  I can't recommend this game at all.. It gets zero stars and isn't worth your money, your time, or your frustration..\n\n*EDIT:  Okay so on a whim I completely reinstalled windows from the ground up the same day that they released a new patch for the game..  Now the game is playable..  I can't actually say if it was due to the windows reinstall, the patch or both.. *\n\n*I have been playing a lot of multiplayer and I can say its not bad but still has a lot of issues which makes me think the original issue was the game not my machine..  I still get a lot of stuttering with the game as well as the crashes..  The server list is still completely borked, and server hangups/crashes seem constant too which tells me the game still needs more patching before it's good to go.. *\n\n*I'd still recommend waiting.. *\n","collection":"posts","url":"/game-review-call-of-duty-black-ops/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2010-11-14-40k-grot-tanks.md","collection":"posts","url":"/40k-grot-tanks/","path":"_posts/2010-11-14-40k-grot-tanks.md","id":"/40k-grot-tanks","draft":false,"categories":["Hobbies"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"40k Grot Tanks","layout":"post","tags":["3D Graphics"],"image":"/images/2010/11/GrotTankDemo06.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2010-11-14 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"40k-grot-tanks","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2010-11-13-game-review-call-of-duty-black-ops.md","excerpt":"I really do enjoy the Call of Duty franchise..  It started out as a PC shooter back in 2003 and was pretty much heralded as the game to be or beat..  They continued with expansion after expansion and broadened their horizons to other machines.","id":"/game-review-call-of-duty-black-ops","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Game Review: Call of Duty Black Ops","layout":"post","tags":["Call of Duty","Review"],"image":"/images/2010/11/Black-Ops.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2010-11-13 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"game-review-call-of-duty-black-ops","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2010-11-05-game-review-star-wars-the-force-unleashed-2.md","excerpt":"I never played the first Force Unleashed game and I sorta regretted it as I knew several folks who said it was a pretty good game..  So I was really excited when they announced a Force Unleashed 2 for the PC...
