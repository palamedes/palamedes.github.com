It was a pretty tall undertaking to begin with and I was doing it in a language that I had just learned..  A bit of a lofty goal to be honest..  Doable, but the motivation wasn't really there..\n\nI didn't really feel any pressing issue as wordpress was working just fine -- but then I really thought about it and I realized that WP wasn't working just fine for me.. infact, I had pretty much stopped using it entirely due to its various issues and my particular feelings about it.  I was no longer updating my blog at all and that was starting to go against the grain..\n\nTo be frank, I was tired of the design and the lack of flexibility, it's bloat, it's poor performance and it's constant security issues..  I think WP is a fine solution if you have no technical chops and I think its place on the web has been thoroughly earned, but for me I just didn't want to have to fight with it any more.\n\nI wanted to write some stuff for it and I've been working exclusively in Ruby for the past year and a half, so I was not really interested in working on something written in PHP, a language that now officially considers me an apostate.\n\nI also noticed that every damn time I logged in there were new hacks or exploits injected into it that hadn't been there previously..  My server is hardened yet people still manage to find ways to exploit WP to put their crap in my blog..  So I was tired of it constantly getting exploited and having to fight that fight was very draining only disincentivized me even more.\n\nI examined what I was trying to do with my blog and started to shop around for ruby solutions;  Enter Jekyll.\n\nJekyll is \"a simple, blog aware, static site generator\" that's written entirely in Ruby that allows me to write my blog entries in simple markdown and export the whole thing using Git to deploy.\n\nI was putting a lot of time, effort and code into a blogging solution that was basically a replacement for wordpress, but it solved all the same problems in exactly the same way -- just in a different language..  That doesn't make sense and it was a bad idea from the start..\n\nAlso one of the directions I was going was to have it so that my dynamic blogging solution would output git pages statically..  Well, why do I need the dynamic blog at all then?!\n\nThe best part is, I can just host it on Github itself, or Amazone S3 for pennies.  And all the files are static, so there is no blog to hack.  There is no back end code to exploit.  Oh and if you do manage to break it or wipe it out, I just redeploy.  Done.\n\nReally it is the best solution out there for this and I'm very excited about using it.\n\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2012-11-07-electoral-college-versus-popular-vote.md","url":"/electoral-college-versus-popular-vote/","relative_path":"_posts/2012-11-07-electoral-college-versus-popular-vote.md","id":"/electoral-college-versus-popular-vote","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"layout":"post","title":"Electoral college versus popular vote","tags":["Voting"],"published":true,"type":"post","ribbon":null,"image":"/images/2013/01/electoralvote.jpg","gallery":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2012-11-07 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"electoral-college-versus-popular-vote","ext":".md"},"url":"/blogging-like-its-1999/","relative_path":"_posts/2013-02-01-blogging-like-its-1999.md","id":"/blogging-like-its-1999","collection":"posts","excerpt":"I have officially adopted Jekyll as my blogging solution, holy crap..

Way back then it took several days if not longer to travel all those distances and so quite often votes weren't being made at all. The electoral college system changed all that and allowed people to have a voice even when they weren't able to directly cast a ballot. It's very much a winner take all system, so in one sense the general election popular vote does not matter when you consider the country as a whole.\n\nWhere it does matter is at a state level; As a rule of thumb, the electoral college will award the winner of your states popular vote all of the state's electoral votes. And, the winner of the most electoral votes wins the general election.\n\nThe use of the electoral college system is a debatable issue at this point in history it gives and takes. On the one hand, it makes dissenting votes in a non-swing state meaningless. For example, if your state is heavily Democratic, your vote for Republican party member (while it still technically counts) really has no impact on the election as a whole.\n\nOn the other hand, it prevents grossly overpopulated states from having total control of the election. Without the electoral college vote system in place and if the popular vote was all that counted, states like California, New York, Illinois and Georgia would have a huge influence on the election while entire states like Iowa or Alaska (which are very lightly populated by comparison) would not have any significance in the election at all.\n\nWhat I find interesting is, I believe the electoral college system actually encourages people to not vote. Under the electoral college system, if you know your state is primarily Democratic or primarily Republican and you tend to vote the same way then you don't actually have to vote because really your vote won't count towards the popular vote of any other state and if your state votes your way already why bother taking the trip in the first place.\n\nOn the other hand, if your state primarily votes one way and you vote the other, then the electoral college system can be seen as a form of oppression or even tyranny of the masses because no amount of voting will actually make any difference -- so again why bother?\n\nI think at one time the electoral college system was really a good thing, but I'm not sure it is any more. Maybe it's something of a bygone age that needs to be reconsidered in this modern time of fast cars, internet and ultra connectivity. I think the original intention was good but is it still relevant?\n\nLet's take a vote...\n","previous":{"next":{"path":"_posts/2012-11-07-electoral-college-versus-popular-vote.md","url":"/electoral-college-versus-popular-vote/","relative_path":"_posts/2012-11-07-electoral-college-versus-popular-vote.md","id":"/electoral-college-versus-popular-vote","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"layout":"post","title":"Electoral college versus popular vote","tags":["Voting"],"published":true,"type":"post","ribbon":null,"image":"/images/2013/01/electoralvote.jpg","gallery":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2012-11-07 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"electoral-college-versus-popular-vote","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2012-11-05-wow-its-really-been-a-while.md","output":null,"content":"Hey guys, I'm went dark for quite some time apparently and I didn't really mean to let this much time passed since my last post.\n\nLife is been incredibly busy for me; I feel like I'm working three or four different jobs, playing three or four different games, waiting for a bunch of things that happen and ultimately I want to move the hell out of Texas.\n\nI'm still working on my own blogging solution, it's coming along nicely it's just not quite ready for prime time yet.

Turns out that bug had nothing to do with WordPress but was rather an issue with my host.. It's been resolved, but that niggling desire to [create my own blogging software](/my-own-custom-blogging-software/ \"My own custom blogging software\") stuck..\n\nThis is something I wanted to create from the ground up that would be a 100% \"my own\" solution to include even the look&amp;feel theme of the thing and I decided that it would also be 100% open source from the start.\n\nI wanted to use this project as a possible way to expand my horizons but I also wanted something functional that I could use and expand on quickly;  the more I thought (and still think) about this the sooner I wanted off WordPress, not because WordPress is a bad thing (it's not) but because I wanted something that was fully mine that I could modify to my heart's content.\n\nSo with that, I moved forward with my project and started looking at which language I wanted to write it in.   After some consideration I decided to limit myself to writing the code in Python, Ruby, Node, or PHP.\n\nI knew from the get-go that I didn't really want to write this thing in PHP.   PHP is a great language but it's getting a little long in the tooth and frankly some of the frameworks out there leave a lot to be desired.   Plus I have been writing PHP since '96 or so.. I'm ready to move on..\n\n<a href=\"/images/2012/03/rubypress02.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"RubyPress Admin\" src=\"/images/2012/03/rubypress02-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"RubyPress Admin\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>RubyPress Admin</span></a>\n\nSo with my original intent in mind I decided to branch out and try NodeJS as I really like JavaScript and I think node is fairly clever.  I played with node for a couple of weeks even making an initial start on the blogging software and while I do believe Node is pretty cool, I just don't think it's \"quite there\" yet.  I think node has a little bit of growing to do before it's fully matured, which isn't to take away from it at all but rather just my opinion on its current state.  For whatever reason, node didn't excite me.\n\nThis left me in a bit of a pickle;  Suddenly my language options went to Python, Ruby or back to PHP.   At the time I knew nothing about Python or Ruby compared to my PHP knowledge.\n\nI had to do some serious considering here and what I ultimately came back to was one simple fact;  PHP and the myriad of MVC frameworks I've worked with (Zend, Kohana, Cake, Symfony etc...) as well as Python and it's MVC frameworks (Django's really the only one I have any experience with) all do their damnedest to do what Rails is doing.\n\nRails does all the big stuff right out of the box and then you have the whole Gem library thing... dear god.. RoR seems awesome.. okay lets give that a try!  I've never so much as cracked a book on Ruby before so this will be a 100% new thing for me.. *shrug* why not?!  Off to the races I went.\n\nSide note:  I found that [Lynda.com](http://www.lynda.com/) has some nice beginner intro courses on Ruby and Rails and of course Ryan Bates at [Railscasts.com](http://railscasts.com/) has lots of good video information for the watching.. both are totally worth checking out..\n\nNow set the \"not so\" way-forward machine to 10 days later:    I've been working on it for 10 days or so, on and off, and in that amount of time I have created a system that allows me to import content directly from WordPress and display it on the site as seen in the screenshot above using my new theme.    I can create users, posts, pages, messages, have a functional (if sparse yet) admin area that forces authentication etc..  and they all work!\n\nSo, in 10 days using a language and framework I don't know and have never used before,  using plugins and modules I don't know and have never used before, even a brand new IDE..  etc..  I have managed to implement the core functionality of WordPress..    Holy crap, Ruby and Rails are easy as hell..   Seriously this stuff writes itself..  (I'm using [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) and [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) which I think are both brilliant and likely will be using CanCan and a few other gems as I need them. )\n\nI'm jokingly calling this project \"RubyPress\", more as a codename than a real product name since it's now become a Ruby blogging software to replace WordPress..\n\nI have no idea if it will grow beyond my getting the basic blogging functionality working.. I still have a lot of stuff that are requirements like categories, tags, theme support..etc..  Lots and lots to do.. but I'm really enjoying it, and learning Rails at the same time.. so win win..   There is still a lot of \"magic\" to Ruby for me, stuff that I'm not sure how or why it works the way it does..etc.. but slowly I'm getting it..  I'm sure this thing will require a dozen rewrites before it's not embarrassing.. heh  What can I say.. I'm a Ruby and Rails noob.. bear with me..\n\nThough I have to admin, it's coming together so quickly that I do entertain the notion of having something that might one day actually compete with WordPress.. WordPress itself has been around since 2003 and has a lot of very cool functionality that I doubt I'll ever match in my little toy project, but wouldn't it be fun?  =D\n\nIt is 100% open source; [https://github.com/palamedes/Press](https://github.com/palamedes/Press)\n\nI will keep working on it and eventually have something worth using I hope..  For now I'm still on WordPress..\n","previous":{"next":{"path":"_posts/2012-03-26-rubypress-wordpress-replacement.md","url":"/rubypress-wordpress-replacement/","relative_path":"_posts/2012-03-26-rubypress-wordpress-replacement.md","id":"/rubypress-wordpress-replacement","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Software Development"],"layout":"post","title":"RubyPress Wordpress Replacement","tags":["Ruby","Ruby on Rails","WordPress"],"published":true,"type":"post","image":"/images/2012/03/rubypress01-150x150.jpg","gallery":null,"ribbon":"ruby","allow_comments":true,"private":false,"date":"2012-03-26 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"rubypress-wordpress-replacement","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2012-03-02-tellico-turnings-sign.md","output":null,"content":"<a href=\"/images/2012/03/signone.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Tellico Turnings Sign\" src=\"/images/2012/03/signone-e1330746540276-150x102.jpg\" alt=\"Tellico Turnings Sign\" width=\"150\" height=\"102\" /><br /><span>Tellico Turnings Sign</span></a>\n\nSo while in [Tennessee with my father](/dads-new-store/ \"My latest trip to TN and Dads new store\"), I told him I'd make him some signs for his shop.   This was the first time I had ever attempted to do something like this and it took me the better part of 4 days working a couple hours a night to get one done.\n\n<a href=\"/images/2012/03/signtemplate.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"Sign Template\" src=\"/images/2012/03/signtemplate-e1330746875648-150x89.jpg\" alt=\"Sign Template\" width=\"150\" height=\"89\" /><br /><span>Sign Template</span></a>\n\nI created a template in photoshop that I thought would look nice based on discussions I had with dad while up there with intent of creating a sign wider than it was tall that would hang over the door of the shop.\n\nThe sign would be made up of three 1/4\" thick plywood panels.  Each outer panel would have the lettering cut out via the scroll saw and the inner panel would be stained dark and then sandwiched between the outers in order to give the final appearance.\n\nI made one side \"clean\" and professional looking (or rather as professional as I could with my meager skills), and one side more of an \"art\" look to it where I intentionally over sanded some of it just to get a unique look.  The edges are routed and rounded over and the sign as a whole is sanded smooth.\n\nI don't know if I like the \"art\" side.. I mean it doesn't look horrible and it does have that unique scrubbed and hard used look I was going for, but I used too much glue when putting the sign together and it shows..  lesson learned..\n\nThe sign is 20\" wide by 12\" tall by 3/4\" thick and all in all not too bad if I do say so myself.\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2012-02-29-dads-new-store.md","url":"/dads-new-store/","relative_path":"_posts/2012-02-29-dads-new-store.md","id":"/dads-new-store","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Hobbies"],"layout":"post","title":"My latest trip to TN and Dads new store","tags":["Wood Working"],"type":"post","published":true,"image":"/images/2012/02/shop00.jpg","allow_comments":true,"date":"2012-02-29 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"dads-new-store","ext":".md"},"url":"/tellico-turnings-sign/","relative_path":"_posts/2012-03-02-tellico-turnings-sign.md","id":"/tellico-turnings-sign","collection":"posts","excerpt":"So while in Tennessee with my father, I told him I'd make him some signs for his shop...","draft":false,"categories":["Hobbies"],"layout":"post","title":"Tellico Turnings Sign","tags":["Wood Working","Scroll Saw"],"status":"publish","type":"post","published":true,"image":"/images/2012/03/signone.jpg","gallery":null,"tile_size":"1x3","allow_comments":true,"date":"2012-03-02 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"tellico-turnings-sign","ext":".md"},"url":"/rubypress-wordpress-replacement/","relative_path":"_posts/2012-03-26-rubypress-wordpress-replacement.md","id":"/rubypress-wordpress-replacement","collection":"posts","excerpt":"So a while back I had thought my WordPress install was getting exploited through some bug and decided I wanted to write my own replacement...","draft":false,"categories":["Software Development"],"layout":"post","title":"RubyPress Wordpress Replacement","tags":["Ruby","Ruby on Rails","WordPress"],"published":true,"type":"post","image":"/images/2012/03/rubypress01-150x150.jpg","gallery":null,"ribbon":"ruby","allow_comments":true,"private":false,"date":"2012-03-26 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"rubypress-wordpress-replacement","ext":".md"},"url":"/wow-its-really-been-a-while/","relative_path":"_posts/2012-11-05-wow-its-really-been-a-while.md","id":"/wow-its-really-been-a-while","collection":"posts","excerpt":"Hey guys, I'm went dark for quite some time apparently and I didn't really mean to let this much time passed since my last post..","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"layout":"post","title":"wow it's really been a while","tags":[],"published":true,"type":"post","image":"/images/2013/01/beenawhile.jpg","gallery":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2012-11-05 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"wow-its-really-been-a-while","ext":".md"}
