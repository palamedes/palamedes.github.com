            <p>Hey guys, I’m went dark for quite some time apparently and I didn’t really mean to let this much time passed since my last post.</p>

<p>Life is been incredibly busy for me; I feel like I’m working three or four different jobs, playing three or four different games, waiting for a bunch of things that happen and ultimately I want to move the hell out of Texas.</p>

<p>I’m still working on my own blogging solution, it’s coming along nicely it’s just not quite ready for prime time yet. More than anything I’m learning about Ruby and programming in the Ruby on rails environment. I’m sure once all is said and done all have a decent product to share with the world, but it still just too early to release. (Even though you can actually get it online right now it might github account – I would avoid doing so for the time being.)</p>

<p>I’ve actually made a couple posts on my new blogging system, and those will become available once my blogging system goes live but I haven’t bothered import them into WordPress yet and probably won’t.</p>

<p>Melissa and I are still very much wanting to move out of Texas and go to someplace like Tennessee or Georgia. We’ve been doing a lot of research and have some areas in mind; right now were looking at Blue Ridge Georgia. It’s a very beautiful area with a lot of resort like cabins and whatnot and I honestly can’t wait to live there. However, we have to wait for David weekly to get off their ass and actually correct what’s wrong with our house –  We are still fighting that seven-year long fight with them regarding our foundation issues. It’s an endless battle and to be honest I’m really tired of it – I just want it all to go away.</p>

<p>But towards that end, we started cleaning up the house and started moving things out that we don’t want here when we do show the house.  Here soon I will contact a couple different realtors and have them come out and tell us what we need to do in order to proceed. here today or tomorrow, I’m going to get a storage unit so that the decrapification of the house may continue.</p>

<p>I’m trying to think of what else is going on.</p>

<p>I’m starting to get that really weird foot pain again. I have those orthotics that the doctor gave me but to be honest those damn things hurt me more then not wearing them. I think ultimately I just need some new shoes, my tennis shoes are really rather old at this point.</p>

<p>Some friends and I are looking at creating our own little video/audio blogging podcast around the programming we do in projects that we want to participate in. More than anything it’s going to be four guys talking to one another just, fucking around but it’s going be a lot of fun. I doubt anyone will seriously watch it, more than anything is just a fun way for us to keep in touch and goof off. But to that end I went ahead and purchased a really nice podcasting microphone. I have it hooked up on a boom mic stand and everything so that it sticks right in front of my mouth and can easily be pushed out of the way when I don’t need it.</p>

<p>So for grins I went ahead and got a copy of Dragon natural speaking so that I can do some dictation. I figure that if I’m going to get this really nice microphone and get it set up to do this podcasting thing I might as well kill two birds with one stone and get the dictation software that I’ve always wanted to try so that I can give it a whack.</p>

<p>I have to admit I’m really rather impressed; Dragon NaturallySpeaking is really fucking cool. Everything you see in this post was actually dictated directly from word-of-mouth to the WordPress text box with very little editing done post process. (it just wouldn’t recognize “decrapification” since it’s not a real word and I’m still trying to figure out how to train that word in.. heh)</p>

<p>I knew that there was a lot of really good dictation software out there but I had no concept that it was this good.</p>

<p>The other nice thing about this dictation solution is that it will likely encourage me to create more posts and updates.</p>

<p>Anyway that’s all for now I’ll try to be better about updating sorry took so long – not that anyone actually reads this.. I have to admit this stuff is more for me than anyone else.</p>
