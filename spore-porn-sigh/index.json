I'm cool with that.. But the ranger should be able to put out some damage, and since they can't tank, they should be able to put out damage at range.  If they can't for any reason do ranged damage, what's the point of a ranger?   \n\nIn AoC the ranger can melee, use a bow, or use a crossbow.   Melee with an AoC ranger is a joke -- don't waste your time.  Crossbow has some nice damage, but its slow damage -- and the majority of the skills are for bow not crossbow.  You're really best using a bow.\n\nOkay fine. I'll use a bow -- which is what I wanted in the first place.  The issue is with the various attack abilities with a bow, most of them are broken.\n\n__Salvo__\nThe number one issue, and the number one skill used by a bow ranger is \"Salvo\".  Salvo pisses me off to no end.\n\nSalvo is a 3 key combo  -- Meaning you poke the \"Salvo\" hot key, then you have to do two directional attacks in order to get the full combo (and thus the full damage) to fire off.  The problem is that salvo, as the name implies, fires more shots than you press keys for.\n\nThe first salvo hot key fires one shot usually straight initiating the combo.  The second key fires one shot either left or lower left, to try to get them to refocus their shields. And the third key fires 3 shots straight -- but it does 3 individual attacks, its not like you knock up 3 arrows and fire them all at once.\n\nIt's this third key that is the problem in that if anything interrupts your third key and those 3 attacks, the mob gets all the health back that he lost due to the combo.   This could be over a thousand points of health he just suddenly gets back.. *pop*  Insta-heal.\n\nFurther more, if you kill him on the first shot of the salvo, he still does damage to you until the entire combo finishes.  It takes about 8 seconds for the entire combo to resolve itself and I have died many times during that 8 seconds to a mob that was DEAD but still swinging.. \n\nAnd of course if they kill you this way, they are suddenly full health and back standing there!!\n\nIf the mob dodges or you \"miss\" with the first shot of the salvo, ALL shots of the salvo miss. Time well spent.\n\nSalvo needs to be fixed.. But so far they wont even acknowledge that it's a bug.\n\n__Some shots don't register at all__\nSometimes you will go through the combo keys and nothing happens on the final key.  No \"Miss\" text, no \"Mob is too far away\" text, nothing.. just.. nothing.  You're left standing there wondering why the hell the mob didn't just take damage.  Time well spent.  \n\n__No Range__\nThe ranger also has ZERO RANGE!  It kills me how short ranged the bow is.. A bow in AoC has about a 50 foot range.  (Hard to say how many \"feet\" it actually is, but it aint far.)  I'm not saying the bow should have a 300 yard range, but it should have a longer range than it does.  It's down right silly how short it is, and makes a rangers life suck as you basically have to get into melee range to shoot.\n\nGive us some room to shoot folks!\n\n__Different Range First Person to Third Person__\nWhat?!  I want to know who the smacktard was that thought it was a good idea to give the bow and crossbow a different range based on first person or third person shooting.  What bone head thought this was a good idea?\n\nWhy does my bow have a range half again as long when in first person?  Why does my bow's combo's have a very short range, yet I can key up an arrow to fire at any range? etc..  This is just stupid.. \n\n__Shooting from a ledge__\nOne of the missions early on tells you that you need to go stop the mobs from shooting their bows from a ledge high up, because it's killing the good guys.  SO you rush up there, kill them, only to realize that .. hey, this is a good spot to snipe back at the bad guys too!\n\nSo, you target up a mob and let fly.. Only to see them constantly evade..  You have line of sight, you have range.. you are above them though and they \"can't get to you\" so instead of letting you murder them fair and square, they just evade,evade,evade like a broken mob.  \n\nThis is fucked up.. The whole point of the mission was to stop them from doing this, only to find out that YOU can't do this.   WHY?!  If I can get up on this ledge, so can they -- as proven by the fact that THEY WERE UP HERE FIRST!  This is just down right stupid and breaks the game to me.  You say you want players to be clever and try new things, then break the new things we try.  What bullshit.   If mobs are getting shot from someone they can't get to, RUN OUT OF RANGE.  It's short enough... \n\nI can go on, but you get the point by now..  This game is very beautiful.. More over, the 1 to 20 game is awe inspiring, and should be a lesson to other games as to how a game should be made.  \n\nAt 21 though (or when you get off the island) the polish comes crashing down.  It's sad really.  I know for a fact it's driving players away.  Several of my friends have already left due to these annoying bugs.. Above are just the ones that the ranger suffers.. each class has their own set just like this.. \n\nI do like the new combat system, but it isn't enough to support a game.  You need to get the rest of this crap working.. \n\nIn six or eight months this game will likely be awesome.. but for now it's annoying and upsets me.  Time will tell, but I dunno if I will stick it out.\n\n \n\n \n","collection":"posts","url":"/age-of-conan-annoys-me/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2008-06-17-super-heroes-is-st00pid.md","collection":"posts","url":"/super-heroes-is-st00pid/","path":"_posts/2008-06-17-super-heroes-is-st00pid.md","id":"/super-heroes-is-st00pid","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Super Heroes is st00pid","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2008/06/cohgamebox.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-06-17 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"super-heroes-is-st00pid","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2008-06-15-age-of-conan-annoys-me.md","excerpt":"I'm starting to get upset / annoyed with Age of Conan.  Probably it's more fair to say, disappointed -- but you can only scream at your monitor for so long before disappointment spirals down into something else. ","id":"/age-of-conan-annoys-me","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Age of Conan is beginning to annoy me","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2008/06/age_of_conan_cover.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-06-15 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"age-of-conan-annoys-me","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2008-06-17-super-heroes-is-st00pid.md","content":"<img class=\"pull-right\" title=\"City of Heroes\" src=\"/images/2008/06/cohgamebox-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" />\n\nCity of Heroes (and thus City of Villains) is one of those sleeper games that has a lot of hidden depth.  I played CoH for almost a year starting back in Feb. 2005 when it first came out.  I like to refer to it as MMO Lite.\n\nIt's a good game, and a good starter game for those who aren't really sure about the whole MMO scene.  It's very simple to play and enjoy, and doesn't bog you down with many of the more complex MMO aspects.  For new comers to the market, its perfect.   It's how I got my wife into MMO's and now I can't get her away from the computer.. heh  (\"I just have this one last quest to do..\"  \"Uh huh.. sure honey.. \"  heh)\n\nAfter a while I moved on to other games, but found myself reactivating my account from time to time to give it a try.  For a while I played my City of Villains character almost exclusively until it once again just tired and I moved on.\n\nWell I'm back at it.  They have added a lot of content and depth to the game that really is interesting.  Firstly its not like your more modern / typical MMO in that there aren't characters standing around with question marks over their head letting you know there is something to do.  Lets be honest here, World of Warcraft is a good game but its seriously \"dumbed down\" in that it almost holds your hand while it plays itself.\n\nCity of Heroes hearkens back to the days of EverQuest 1 whereby you didn't know if someone had a quest or something for you unless you talked to them.  Accomplishments were hidden from you, and thereby meant more to you when you actually accomplished it.\n\nDeath in CoH means something too compared to modern day MMO's.  CoH has debt!   Now I played Ultima Online and EverQuest 1 for years, so extremely painful death was the norm for me.  In UO each time some naked PK ran up and killed you, you lost EVERYTHING!  It sucked.  In EQ1 though they changed that a lot in that you just had to make a corpse run and lost exp.  But you didn't lose your stuff..   When CoH came out and they made it so you just got a little bit of debt, I was stunned.  They made death meaningless.\n\nHA!  Look at what modern games do.  In the most recent MMO, Age of Conan, death means absolutely nothing. You just get shot back to a respawn point.\n\nBut I get side tracked -- the CoH is a good game and I'm finding I really enjoy the new Rikti invasion stuff and I hope they will let us \"counter invade\" at some point.  It'd be really cool to go to the Rikit homeworld or whatever and attack them back!! (maybe you can do this already and I just havent gotten to that content.. I dunno)\n\nSomething else they have added to the game is a pretty thorough marketplace and crafting system.  I like that -- thats pretty darn cool.  Well, one of the tricks of old is to watch your prices on that market.  I mean I dont understand why players, in game after game, will put stuff on the market below what they could sell them to the merchant for!!\n\nI spent about 4 hours last night just running goods from the market to the local merchant to sell.  People would put stuff on the market for 10INF, that they could sell to the merchants for 4500+INF.   Seriously.\n\nIn 4 hours I made 2 million INF which just goes to show you, super heroes is st00pid.  Or lazy.  I prefer to think of them as stupid.\n","collection":"posts","url":"/super-heroes-is-st00pid/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2008-06-17-super-heroes-is-st00pid.md","collection":"posts","url":"/super-heroes-is-st00pid/","path":"_posts/2008-06-17-super-heroes-is-st00pid.md","id":"/super-heroes-is-st00pid","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Super Heroes is st00pid","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2008/06/cohgamebox.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-06-17 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"super-heroes-is-st00pid","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2008-06-18-spore-porn-sigh.md","content":"<img class=\"pull-right\" title=\"Spore\" src=\"/images/2008/06/sporebox-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" />\n\nSpore is a multi-genre massively single-player online game designed by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Wright_%28game_designer%29\" target=\"_blank\">Will Wright</a> and has drawn quite a lot of attention due to its massive scope and open ended game play.  Add to that the ability of users to customize completely their .. well everything .. from the ground up and you have a very interesting sandbox game (something Will Wright is known for.)\n\nSpore's major concept, and the reason they call it a \"massively single-player online game\" is because all of the content is created by players using editors that are a cross between the \"play doh fun factory\" and Maya 3d modeling software.  All of the editors are designed to be easy to use and powerful, as well as being as similar as possible to one another so that each lesson you learn in one part of the editor can be applied to another part.\n\nThe down side of course is that give the common man an easy and powerful tool to use, and the lowest common denominator will show up and abuse it -- or at least do something in appropriate. \n\nI just KNEW that as soon as I saw what you could do with spore's creature creator, you'd soon see the someone create \"The land of Penis people!!\"..

I pondered it a bit and it occurred to me that this was a very misleading question, and showed an error in thinking.  Of the three commonly used formats none of them are \"correct\" and all three of them have their place in web design.  This is very much a \"use the correct format, for the correct job.\"\n\nOf the three image types commonly used on the web today (GIF, PNG and JPEG) usually the argument comes in the form of people agreeing that JPEG has one use; and either GIF or PNG has the other use. The religious war begins when folks try to argue the merits of GIF versus PNG.  And usually it comes in the form of arguing PNG's new hotness and it's lack of support by Microsoft against GIF as the old standard that may not have as many features but at least its supported.\n\nLets examine each format;\n\n__Graphics Interchange Format__, or GIF is an 8 bit format that was introduced by CompuServe back in the late 80's. It's one of the first 2 image formats used on the world wide web and continues to be one of the big three formats used through out the web.  GIF images are compressed using the Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) lossless data compression technique and as of 1989 and the GIF89a format can store multiple images in a single stream.  The GIF format uses a palette of up to 256 distinct colors from the 24-bit RGB color space.\n\n__Portable Network Graphics__, or PNG was created in the mid 90's and was created with the intention of improving upon and replacing the GIF format.  The PNG brings to the table the ability to have an alpha channel transparency which gives us a much wider range of transparency options.   The PNG also gives us a much wider range of color depths than GIF (truecolor up to 48-bit compared to 8-bit 245-color), which allows for greater color precision and smoother fades..etc..  In just about every way the PNG is superior to the GIF, save one.  PNG's do not support storing multiple images in a single file.\n\n__Joint Photographic Experts Group__, or JPEG was a group who got together and issued a graphical standard (of the same name) back in the early 90's.  It's commonly used for compressing photographic images and allows for an adjustable degree of compression.  This adjustment gives the user a tradeoff between storage size and image quality.\n\n__In my opinion__,  any more for your small graphics I'd use PNG.  PNG's are far superior to GIF's in that they can achieve greater compression, have a \"cleaner\" compression algorithm, have wider range of color, more transparency options, and are very easy to work with.\n\nThe PNG's major down fall was it's lack of full support from Microsoft -- hell they used to crash IE4..  However, as of IE7 support is native (with full alpha transparency) and once IE6 hits its end of life (which I personally think needed to happen back in August of 2001) there really is only one reason to use a GIF and that's for animations.  (Though in all likelihood you'll see an influx of browsers supporting MNGs natively in the near future which is the PNG extension that supports animations.)\n\nFor any large color intense image (photographs) use a JPEG.\n\nIt really is that simple..\n\nIf you're aiming for IE6 and absolutely need to use a transparent PNG you can use various IE PNG fixs JS hacks to make them work -- though what a pain.  If you don't need the transparency just use a GIF.\n","collection":"posts","url":"/which-format-to-use-gif-jpeg-png/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2008-06-25-javascript-obfuscation.md","collection":"posts","url":"/javascript-obfuscation/","path":"_posts/2008-06-25-javascript-obfuscation.md","id":"/javascript-obfuscation","draft":false,"categories":["Software Development"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Javascript Obfuscation","layout":"post","tags":["Javascript"],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-06-25 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"javascript-obfuscation","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2008-06-23-which-format-to-use-gif-jpeg-png.md","excerpt":"I was asked today what my professional opinion was with regards to which graphical format to use in web design.
