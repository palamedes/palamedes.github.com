That was the soft limit I had applied to myself  --  Any more than that and I was spending too much.\n\nPlus I had a pretty specific style of car I wanted.. The ones that were in the running where the Mitsubishi Eclipse, the Pontiac Solstice, the Saturn Sky, the Nissan 350z or anything else comparable..\n\nI had decided I didn't want the Nissan because I didn't like the 350's interior.. it just seemed cheap to me, the dash just sucked.   The body was good but if I don't like the interior (the part I would be looking at) I know I wouldn't be happy. (Addendum, the 370's look much much nicer..)\n\nI didn't like the Solstice or the Sky for two different reasons, even though it's essentially the same car.  Again the body looked great!  But the interior of the Solstice looked kinda cheap again, and the Sky is a Saturn and everyone I know that has ever owned a Saturn said they weren't very good cars.  Fair enough, other buyers reviews go a long way for me.  The Sky was out by popular demand  and the Solstice with it's cheap interior was a Pontiac which I'm kinda \"Feh\" about anyway.  Scratch those two.\n\nThat left the Eclipse.  I sorta liked the old Eclipse, but when they introduced the new body style I thought it looked great!  I wanted to check it out more thoroughly..  I had done some pricing, read some reviews, built the car I wanted online and it really did fit the bill.. It was time to check one out in person..\n\nSo today we decided on a whim to go to the local Mitsubishi dealership and scope one of those out..  Just a fun way to spend a lazy Saturday, with no intention of buying anything.. Just window shopping..\n\nFirstly it took us hours to find a Mitsubishi dealership.. There are quite a few of them listed as being in Austin, but we could only find one.   Apparently they had a massive restructuring or something and are hurting..  That didn't bode well..   But we did find one and took a test drive..  Not a bad car but I wasn't super impressed..\n\nI did like it, but it wasn't anything that I felt I needed, and it really didn't feel like a huge upgrade from my Toyota Tundra..  Not a bad car and while yes it fit the bill being as I wanted to go from a truck to a sports car, it sort of felt more like a lateral move.. I wasn't sure I wanted to spend that kind of money on a car I was kind of \"eh\" about, especially since it would have been for 10 years.  (I assume all vehicle purchases are for 10 years.. )\n\nMelissa suggested we check out some of the other dealerships in the area to see what they had on their used lot..  Just to sort of round out the day..    Plus one of her coworkers said she had seen some really good deals on the Mercedes lot.  (I thought this was a clever plan by Melissa to go look at the cars she likes and wants..heh.. Turns out I was sort of right.. she was browsing I noted.. Pretty sure she's gonna demand a new car soon.. But that's another story.. )\n\nI was okay with that notion, but I'm not a huge fan of used cars.. I always feel like you're buying someone elses problem.. But Melissa's SLK was used when we got it and it's a great car with no problems..   I guess I'm used to thinking of people buying the cheap 15K car and then selling it used completely trashed..  So her experience with the SLK really kind of opened my eyes to the fact that people with nicer cars, most likely have taken care of them..\n\nSo with that in mind, we hit up an Infiniti dealer, a Lexus dealership and finally a Mercedes-Benz dealership all just browsing around.. No intention to buy.   Most of them had nothing in the used car areas that was remotely interesting to me or completely outside the realm of affordable ( which was what I expected to begin with. )\n\nWhile looking around at the Mercedes-Benz dealership though, we sat in a bunch of the cars which brought a sales man over..  Nice guy who was willing to just shoot the breeze with us while we tooled around pretending to be able to afford sixty and seventy thousand dollar cars..\n\nThen we started looking at the thirty and forty thousand dollar cars and I realized that this used thirty thousand dollar car is FAR nicer than the brand new Eclipse could EVER be..  I told the guy what I really wanted and he said something to the effect of \"Oh yeah I have a car just like that over here.. \"..  No wait.. Really?   A nice fully featured convertible v6 at around thirty thousand?\n\n<img class=\"pull-right\" title=\"mb2\" src=\"/images/2009/03/mb2.jpg\" alt=\"mb2\" width=\"350\" height=\"235\" />And sure as hell..  He put me in a used 2007 Mercedes-Benz CLK350 with only 14k miles on it, that had me at hello.  It was inside their show room right next to a brand new CLK350 and you couldn't tell which one was used.\n\nThis car had previously been driven by a Mercedes-Benz executive up in New York and as such it had every possible option.  Normally selling new for $63k, it had been incorrectly priced at $36k.   I say incorrectly because the manager rushed out wanting to know if we were taking the car home because it was supposed to be priced at $40k like the other used ones on the lot.  (Apparently this one was one of 3 similar cars they had)\n\nI know you're thinking this was a dog &amp; pony show by the dealer, but I didn't get that impression.  The manager did it out of earshot of us taking the salesman aside to pass this information on.. heh.. Apparently the car was flagged in their system as being incorrectly priced and to revisit it the next business day.. (He told us this once it was all too late for them to up the price.)\n\nAnd so, with no intention to buy anything.. I drove it home.\n\nMelissa was as excited as I was.. I mean she loves Mercedes-Benz anyway, but this is an awesome vehicle for the price..  I really feel we got a steal..  We ran it through Kelly Blue Book and it says it's worth over $37k..  Most dealerships always ask more than what KBB.com says, so the fact that it was even less than that lends credit to the price mistake..\n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.carfax.com/VehicleHistory/p/Report.cfx?partner=EBZ_0&amp;vin=WDBTK56F17F209480\">Carfax report</a> for the car confirms everything that they salesman was telling us and shows that it's never been wrecked or anything..\n\nIt's so nice.. I mean this is a class of car I have never owned.. it's so far beyond what the Eclipse is, it's not a fair comparison..   I never looked at any of the Mercedes as an option because they were all so expensive.. I had my mind set on a new car not a used one.. it really didn't occur to me to think of a used Mercedes. Plus with it's 4 year bumper to bumper warranty what the hell!\n\nIt really is an awesome car.. it drives so nicely I can't even describe it.. Plus sitting inside you'd never know it was a convertible.. It's so quiet!!  You actually hear less road noise in this convertible than you did in my truck!\n\n<img class=\"pull-right\" title=\"mb3\" src=\"/images/2009/03/mb3.jpg\" alt=\"mb3\" width=\"350\" height=\"235\" />The interior is incredible..  It's got an in-dash DVD navigation system, 6 disc CD changer in the glove box that does normal and MP3 cd's, a harman/kardon logic7 sound system, has Sirius satellite radio installed, heated seats, premium leather upholstery every where, automatic adjusting everything... etc.. I mean it's nutz..\n\nGo to their website and check all the options.. that's this car.  The only thing it doesn't have is the phone.  It has all the hookups for it, but no phone installed.  The salesman told me for $400 I could get a bluetooth dongle that would hook into the car making it work with my iPhone.. FUN!\n\nThey took my truck as a trade in on the spot for more than KBB.com valued it at, which I have to admit was a bit of a shock!  And started the paperwork in a flash..  I had to move a lot of junk from my truck to the trunk of the car because I really wasn't expecting to do this today..  I didn't even have time to say good bye to the chariot that had bore me for so long.. (It really was a good truck.. I would recommend the Tundra to anyone..)\n\nBut seriously this car is awesome.. It's hard for me to describe how nice it is..  I'm supremely happy with this purchase and I can easily see this being yet another car I have for 10 years..  With the Eclipse I walked a way feeling a tad underwhelmed by the experience.. here, I'm completely blown away..  This car is so much finer than anything else I have ever driven and I can tell it's going to be a joy to drive for a long while yet..\n\nFunny how these things work out.. I really did have no plans to purchase today..\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2009-03-20-jquery-and-browser-based-games.md","url":"/jquery-and-browser-based-games/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-03-20-jquery-and-browser-based-games.md","id":"/jquery-and-browser-based-games","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Software Development"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"jQuery and Browser based games","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2009/03/t-and-c-surf-designs.png","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-03-20 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"jquery-and-browser-based-games","ext":".md"},"url":"/mercedes-benz-clk350/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-03-22-mercedes-benz-clk350.md","id":"/mercedes-benz-clk350","collection":"posts","excerpt":"So I have been in a the market for a new car for a while now.  I haven't really pushed for it with my wife because neither one of us really wanted a car payment and my truck, while almost 10 years old, worked just fine.","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Mercedes-Benz CLK350","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2009/03/mb1-150x150.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-03-22 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"mercedes-benz-clk350","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2009-03-20-jquery-and-browser-based-games.md","output":null,"content":"<img class=\"pull-right\" title=\"t-and-c-surf-designs\" src=\"/images/2009/03/t-and-c-surf-designs.png\" alt=\"t-and-c-surf-designs\" width=\"156\" height=\"208\" />\n\nI have been playing with the jQuery animate functionality a bit today and it occurred to me that jQuery would likely be the perfect library to build a browser based game on top of..\n\nI did a little browsing about the web, and sure enough.. <a href=\"http://jonraasch.com/blog/jquery-video-game-remake-tc-surf-designs\">someone thought of it before me</a>.\n\nThe games I would want to create would be less animated than this one.. but I could totally see a Masters of Orion remake as a browser based game using the jQuery library..   Or any number of other turn based games..  You could even make them multiplayer fairly easily..\n\nAs computers get faster, and as browser trend towards threaded javascript engines.. Why the hell not?!  At this point I think it would be just as easy/difficult to create a game via a webbrowser as it would via any other medium..\n\nMore over you wouldn't have to sell any kind of client.. everyone with a modern computer has a web browser..  You trade having to create a game that works with hundreds of different graphics drivers and computer configurations for having to deal with 5 major browsers that all do things slightly differently, but big deal..  jQuery does most of that nicely, so really you're only stuck fixing CSS issues..\n\nAs always the trick is in coming up with a game that is compelling enough that others want to play it.  I mentioned Masters of Orion above because I think that's likely one of the best games of all time and as such a perfect candidate for remake in this format.\n\nGranted you're not going to make the next 3D masterpiece as a browser based game.. but I say good..  Games these days are moving towards looking good with zero game play..  Give me a game that is fun to play any day over the latest wiz-bang graphics.. I think the browser game market is a good place to try this..\n","previous":{"next":{"path":"_posts/2009-03-20-jquery-and-browser-based-games.md","url":"/jquery-and-browser-based-games/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-03-20-jquery-and-browser-based-games.md","id":"/jquery-and-browser-based-games","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Software Development"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"jQuery and Browser based games","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2009/03/t-and-c-surf-designs.png","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-03-20 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"jquery-and-browser-based-games","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2009-03-11-jquery-lightbox.md","output":null,"content":"<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2009/03/rocky-mountains-poster.jpg\" class='pull-right'><img title=\"rocky-mountains-poster\" src=\"/images/2009/03/rocky-mountains-poster-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Lightbox Test\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Lightbox Test Image</span></a>\n\nI have been playing with the javascript library jQuery for a couple days now..

I dunno how crazy I'll get though.  Comments would be nice on an image by image basis, but not sure how to go about that.  Either I can try to embed the comments in the page in some hidden way and then have jQuery pull them or I could try loading them from a similarily named file that resides next to the image?  I dunno.\n\nI also like the idea of creating other forms of pop-ups / lightbox styles through the use of the rel attribute.  If you use \"lightbox\" it does what it does now, but if you use \"lightbox_zoom\" (or something) it does something else..   I already have other ideas but I dunno how crazy I want to get.\n\nRight now this system has no way to do groups either.. this is purely a singleton solution right now.  I'd like to add more features but for now it's where its at.  I'm a little stunned at how easy it was to create to be honest.  This bodes very well for jQuery.\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2009-03-09-game-review-empire-total-war.md","url":"/game-review-empire-total-war/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-03-09-game-review-empire-total-war.md","id":"/game-review-empire-total-war","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Game Review: Empire: Total War","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2009/03/empire_christmas2007_1024x768-150x150.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-03-09 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"game-review-empire-total-war","ext":".md"},"url":"/jquery-lightbox/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-03-11-jquery-lightbox.md","id":"/jquery-lightbox","collection":"posts","excerpt":"I have been playing with the javascript library jQuery for a couple days now..

Either that or the reviewers didn't play the same game they published..\n\nI'm going to complain a bit now, but let me say that the game is good and I do like it.   It's major failing at this point is the vast number of bugs..\n\nSo, as good as it is now, it will be even better once they fix all the annoying bugs, and man are there ever a lot of them..  But the potential is so huge I can't wait.. I'm still playing the hell out of it and I do for the most part enjoy it, but the bugs detract from the game something awful.\n\nThere are quite a few memory leak style bugs where the game eventually will crash just due to repeated play or long term play.. Feh.. No big deal.   I completely understand this sort of thing and can forgive it.\n\nThe big issue is the horrible AI employed by the enemy.   The whole point of this game is to have combat in the form of 18th century gun lines where out maneuvering your opponent is as important as the shots fired..\n\nThe computer doesn't do any of that..  It just masses troops towards you in huge blocks of chaos..  Things like buildings and walls completely confuse the AI and a lot of the time they will just stand there stupidly while you blow them away.\n\nOr you will go out of your way to develop a clever tactic only to have the game ignore you completely and march all their troops in a straight line for no apparent reason..\n\nIt's almost impossible to lose a combat at this point just because the AI is retarded.. It's unfortunate, but true..\n\nFrankly, the AI is just appaulingly bad..  I know this stuff is hard, but it really shouldn't have been shipped in the state it is in.  I don't blame the developer for this, this is yet another in a long line of games being pushed out the door before they were ready.  It really sucks that publishers are STILL doing this.\n\nLook, I understand that a game (any game) is lost revinue until the game is out the door, but releasing it before it's ready only hurts your bottom line.  It hurts your bottom line for years to come!  Releasing a game before its ready to be released pisses off the fan base making them not want to buy your next game.   It's extremely short sited to publish a game thinking that you'll fix it in a patch.  You guys need to stop doing it!\n\nSo.. all in all, the game is good.. I give it a strong 4 out of 5..  What keeps it from being a 5 out of 5 is the horrible AI.  That's the only thing..  There are other issues that folks complain about, like the lack of unique uniforms or some little nitpicky details about the animations.. feh.. I can look past that entirely..  The AI is hard to get past..\n\nLets hope they stay true to their model and support the game for a while.. If they patch the AI a bit, the game will be worth every bit of that 94..\n","previous":{"next":{"path":"_posts/2009-03-09-game-review-empire-total-war.md","url":"/game-review-empire-total-war/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-03-09-game-review-empire-total-war.md","id":"/game-review-empire-total-war","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Game Review: Empire: Total War","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2009/03/empire_christmas2007_1024x768-150x150.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-03-09 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"game-review-empire-total-war","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2009-02-05-windows-7-beta.md","output":null,"content":"<img title=\"Windows 7\" src=\"/images/2009/02/vista_7_1-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Windows 7\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" class='pull-right' />\n\nI'm generally slow to change operating systems..  When it comes to making one of those sweeping changes, traditionally I was the equivalent of an old man on his porch yelling for \"you kids to get off my lawn!\"   I was a curmudgeon and quite often would refuse to budge.\n\nI didn't switch to Windows 95 until sometime in 97.. I didn't switch to 98 until 99.. I didn't go to NT at all, and stayed on W2k Pro until well after XP was out.  The only reason I went XP was because it was on the new computer I had purchased already..\n\nMy reason for not wanting to upgrade to the newest version of windows was usually because it's painful, the upgrade sucks and quite often I have to go back.  (I wont even go into my Windows ME story.. I had one of the Microsoft Windows ME senior developers tell me to go back to 98 because ME sucked...  Yeah.. It happened..)\n\nMore over upgrading isn't the way to go.. you should wipe fresh and start over..  I usually dreaded this..   What cured that?  Funnily enough, Ubuntu..\n\nI have installed and reinstalled ubuntu so many times I'm an old hat at it..  It's really easy.    So I went into Windows 7 thinking it was going to be back to the pain..  And was pleasantly surprised..\n\nFirstly what Windows 7 isn't;  It isn't a new OS.  Lets be clear here.. Windows 7 is what Vista should have been.  It's more than a reskin to be sure, but mostly it's a refactor of Vista and a general rebranding to get away from the down right awful publicity that Vista rightly deserved..\n\nHaving said that, I like W7 quite a bit actually.  I have had some issues getting my sound card drivers working, but now that I do everything's peachy.   Because it's entirely based on the Vista core just download and install Vista drivers for it and as a rule you're good to go.\n\nThe install process was simple and clean, and since I installed it on a new drive it correctly put the windows bootloader on the main drive (though it did overwrite my grub loader so now I can't get into linux.. will have to add the linux install to windows bootloader..)    The install was fairly quick all things considered, and it configured all my hardware correctly.\n\nI had World of Warcraft up and running within about 3 minutes of installing the OS because I had precopied it to the drive heh.   Yay I have DX10 now!\n\nMy biggest complaint at this point is two fold;  1. the alt+tab functionality seems really slow and clunky in W7.. In XP its instant.. but for whatever reason in W7 it takes a couple seconds.. Minor complaint though really.. it is a beta after all..\n\nSecondly, I want to know what will happen in August when the license expires..  Will I just be screwed and have to reinstall all over again?  They have already stated that you wont be able to install the automatic updates beyond that point and that the OS will die then.. I find that... Odd..\n\nOH well.. I can say that I would likely purchase this OS if it continues to perform as nicely as it does now.  Since it's the premier gaming platform for PC's at this point I don't have much choice.. heh\n\nI still very much like my Mac.. I still very much like Ubuntu.. but the games demand Dx10, so <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">Vista</span>.. er,  Windows 7 it is..\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2009-02-01-game-review-dawn-of-war-2.md","url":"/game-review-dawn-of-war-2/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-02-01-game-review-dawn-of-war-2.md","id":"/game-review-dawn-of-war-2","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Game Review: Dawn of War 2","layout":"post","tags":["Warhammer","Review"],"image":"/images/2009/02/dawn-of-war-2-1642-150x150.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-02-01 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"game-review-dawn-of-war-2","ext":".md"},"url":"/windows-7-beta/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-02-05-windows-7-beta.md","id":"/windows-7-beta","collection":"posts","excerpt":"I'm generally slow to change operating systems..  When it comes to making one of those sweeping changes, traditionally I was the equivalent of an old man on his porch yelling for \"you kids to get off my lawn!\"   I was a curmudgeon and quite often would refuse to budge.","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Software Review: Windows 7 Beta","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2009/02/vista_7_1-150x150.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-02-05 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"windows-7-beta","ext":".md"},"url":"/game-review-empire-total-war/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-03-09-game-review-empire-total-war.md","id":"/game-review-empire-total-war","collection":"posts","excerpt":"So I have long been a fan of the Total War franchise created by Creative Assembly..  Their games have always been pretty fun -- but most of them have been fairly buggy..","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Game Review: Empire: Total War","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2009/03/empire_christmas2007_1024x768-150x150.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-03-09 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"game-review-empire-total-war","ext":".md"},"url":"/jquery-lightbox/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-03-11-jquery-lightbox.md","id":"/jquery-lightbox","collection":"posts","excerpt":"I have been playing with the javascript library jQuery for a couple days now..
