I never published it because I was so burnt out even the thought of pushing the damn file to the server was too much.  It's a single command.   It's January of 2018 now, I'm still here and still burnt.  I'll talk more to that below.\n\nSoftware developer burnout is a real thing and it's bad.  I had always heard about it and even witnessed others go through it but I had never really experienced myself.  As such I was overly quick to dismiss it or give it lip service without really considering the true ramifications or impact of the event. \n\nI have been a software developer for over 20 years.  No kidding, a long time to be sure.  And I have some how managed to avoid burnout until last year.   I'm sure every industry has some version of developer burnout but with folks in software it's extremely bad, and it takes months if not years to come back.. if they ever do.  It's taken me months to even consider it...\n\nI may not go back.  Honestly at this point I'm looking forward to law enforcement again, but that's a different story.\n\nAnyone can burn out.  From a high end CEO, to a software developer, to a person that digs ditches every day.  Burnout seems to happen when someone does a thing over and over for long periods of time without getting any real joy out of it.  Or without having a sense of accomplishment.  This is what happened to me.\n\nAnd I didn't even realize it until it was too late!\n\nI worked for years for one company or another developing software large and small.  I liked it.  I really enjoyed being an individual contributor that went to work every day creating something that people would use.  \n\nI'll be the first to admit I stayed way too long at IBM, and that by the 6th year mark I was thoroughly done but that was a management issue.  Not the job.   I still loved the job.   (People quit managers, not jobs..  keep that in mind, to that end I still feel bad about yelling at John the way I did.. Where ever you are John, I'm still very regreful and I hope you can one day forgive me for being an idiot.)\n\nThat all kinda changed about mid way through my life at Grok. \n\nGrok Interactive is a small services company that I started with a friend from a previous company and it went really well.  (The company is still going strong, I'm just not there any more for my own sanity reasons =)\n\nI just got to the point where I really didn't enjoy any aspect of the work and I needed out.  Eventually that out came and I ran for the hills!\n\n---  Continued 8 months later!\n\nwhoa.. I forgot I had started this post.  I was actually going to bring up my blog and type this post when I saw it in my queue of stuff to publish..  yes.. yes and double yes.. all of the above is still true.  I'm still crispy about software and at this point my knowledge has almost completely perished.   I have a lot of code I could go back and look at and I'm sure I could bring myself back up to speed but it would have to be on my own terms.  I think my days of working for other software firms as a paid employee in any capacity is over.\n\nRight now I'm working as a Deputy Sheriff for a small county here in North Georgia and I'm enjoying it for the most part.  I still dream about doing stuff in the software field though.  I think of problems and dream up solutions.  I have a couple back burner thoughts that I might try to field test too.  \n\nI will be updating my blog again going forward and I'm playing with some othe software projects too again.. so maybe there's still hope.","collection":"posts","url":"/developer-burnout/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2018-04-20-site-redesign-and-restlessness.md","collection":"posts","url":"/site-redesign-and-restlessness/","path":"_posts/2018-04-20-site-redesign-and-restlessness.md","id":"/site-redesign-and-restlessness","draft":false,"categories":["Software Development"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Site Redesign and Restlessness","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2018/site-redesign.jpg","gallery":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"tile_class":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"duration":null,"costs":null,"date":"2018-04-20 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"site-redesign-and-restlessness","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2017-05-15-developer-burnout.md","excerpt":"I'm sure every industry has some version of developer burnout but with folks in software it's extremely bad, and it takes months if not years to come back.. if they ever do.","id":"/developer-burnout","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Software Developer Burnout...

Life continues apace and I continue to ignore my blog / diary.  I realize now that this blog is nothing more than a modern diary, and not really anything else.  I treat it as such anyway.\n\nI really want to do so many things here though.  Back in the day I made these really cool and clever animated sites and I loved it but I got away with that and have been boring ever since.  I still want to do those things.. I liked doing all that 3D work and enjoyed making those cool sites but wow the time it took was pretty vast and now that I'm older I have so many other things I could be doing haha. \n\nHaving said that,  I get this creative restlessness that makes me want to do something... ANYTHING! but then I realize I have zero creativity and am not able to come up with anything and it eats at me..  There are days that I'm pretty unpleasant to be around simply because I have this ball of angst in the pit of my stomach because I feel like I need to create.. and can't.    I have to settle for doing something less useful and less creative just to get something done.  Like, writing an entry.. or fixing a link or updating a footer ..etc.. \n\nEven then I screw things up.  Like the pagination on my blog is broken.  If you go to the end there are several \"pages\" that are empty.. bleh.\nI have been meaning to turn this whole thing into a static JSON site but haven't gotten around to it.  Again, no time, no creative juices, too much other shit going on.  I will fix it eventually.\n\nI tried ot update to the latest version of Jekyll and .. wow.. Broke the world!  Reverted that until I can figure out why literally EVERYTHING is broken.\n\nI really like the idea of making the entire site work like a windows desktop that would allow me to plant easter eggs and games.. etc.. I still want to make a game.. SO MUCH WANT TO MAKE A GAME!\n\nHell I even want to recreate Zork or Adventure or other text games in the site just for funzies.  I thought about trying to make a static blog / json M.U.D. just to see if I could.   I thought about it long and hard and I actually think I could pull it off with sockets and clever JSON design.  Maybe one day.  Maybe it's here already and you just haven't figured out how to lauch it yet. \n\nMy plane continues going and I recently ordered the fuselage so that's cool.  I get to build more and more!  yay!  plus it's cool having folks watch me.  I dunno why that keeps me motivated but it does.   \n\nI got a really nice trailer for $600!  Super excited about that.  I needed a way to transport things now that I have a jeep instead of a truck and getting a trailer made sense.  But the trailer I wanted was over a thousand dollars.  In fact, it was listed Lowes website for $1499.   I went to lowes to look at it and it was on sale.. for $599.   It was clearly mismarked, and in a line of other smaller trailers that were obviously the $599 trailers, but this one had the $599 sticker on it.  I asked the guy about it and he said, yeah that was correct.  I asked if he was sure, and he said yes.\n\nThe same trailer was in another row marked to $1299 so I'm just about 100% sure this thing was mismarked.. I'm not complaining.  Sometimes you win!  I tried to do the right thing and it paid off. \n \nNot sure how I'm going to afford the engine for the plane yet... if someone wants to fund my plane let me know =)\n\nOkay back to the grind.  I have been writing some software for my wifes work and it's taking all my time.  I have put a LOT of time into it so far and I have a long way to go.
