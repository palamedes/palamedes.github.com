A group of people that I respect and hold in high regard told me in no uncertain terms that I wasn't good enough to be one of them. And that hurt.\n\nRacism is a terrible thing. I have never practiced it nor will I tolerate it in my presence. The common thread in America is that racism is only something that white people do. Only white people can be racist.. A black man or a Hispanic man can't be racist because they are the victims. The white man keeping the minority down.. What a complete bunch of bullshit. Racism is a two way road and both sides are guilty. Both sides are victims. Experiences like the one I had today only propagate and prolong this evil.\n\nI have wanted to be a police officer for a long time. Something I have always wanted to do and I finally had the courage to step forward and sign up. I went through the entire process.. I did their physical test and their evil questionnaires. I filled out their background history check and took a polygraph.. It took 2 months to get that far.. The only thing I had left to do was to take \"the board\"..\n\n__The Board__\n\nFrankly, I was nervous. I have taken boards before in the military though so I didn't think it was going to be too bad. And had they stuck with standardized questions that test your knowledge I am sure I would have done fine. This board however was different.. The questions were biased and contrived. They asked questions that NO ONE should have to answer in that fashion.. I, as well as someone else who had recently taken the board, am convinced that this board was put in place strictly to weed me out.\n\nThe board started out by the psychologist taking me into a room and explaining to me what was going on. Frankly, he was the nicest guy there. Seemed a straight up sort of joe. He had me sign some paper work and then after a minute or two's wait, summoned me into the board room.\n\nThere were 6 people and myself in the room. Two black male detectives, one Hispanic detective, one Hispanic female sergeant, one white lieutenant, and the psychologist. I only mention their ethnicity because it comes into play. Normally, I wouldn't and couldn't care less what your race/creed/color/gender/sexual orientation/etc.. is. I just don't care.. I was in the Army for a long time and in the Army, everyone is green. Its what we are taught..\n\nThe questions started out rather routine.. Why are you here.. Why do you want to do this.. Do you know what you're getting yourself into.. etc.. Fairly benign questions that just gave them an idea of who I was.\n\nAt some point in the meeting the line of questioning switched from an \"interview\" by a board, to an interrogation by this group of angry cops. Whether this was part of the board or this was intentional, I don't know. Suddenly the line of questioning switched from the standard \"why are you here..\" line, to a much more open an difficult to answer line. Frankly, in my mind.. Questions that don't have a correct answer. Here are some direct quoted questions not in any order...\n\nQuestion Example: \"Explain the difference between a black family, and a Hispanic family..\" ... \" How would you treat them differently.. \"\n\nThey had to clarify this to me several times.. To me, people are people.. I don't care if you are black, white, or orange.. I am going to treat you the same way I treat everyone else.. I'm going to give you the same respect I give my father.. That is how I was raised..\n\nThey didn't believe me.. They asked me what the difference was over and over again.. and in the end.. I didn't have an answer.. Sure, music.. language.. color.. hair style's.. etc.. there are a myriad of differences.. but none of these little things should make one iota's difference when you are dealing with them on a professional level. Clearly I am wrong here in their mind.. This by the way is called \"racial profiling\".. Which is illegal in Texas. Austin police officers, as recently as two months ago, were fired for doing this VERY THING.. Yet I was judged inadequate and given poor marks because I wasn't able to be racist.\n\nOne of them actually said that .. and I quote.. \"I can't believe you see through such rose colored glasses...\" HE ACTUALLY USED THOSE WORDS!!\n\nQuestion Example: \"Do you know of any black holidays\" ... \"Why don't you know black holidays?!\"\n\nOne of the black male detectives by this time was getting belligerent.. He couldn't believe I didn't know any \"BLACK\" holidays.. First off.. I'm WHITE! Secondly, what religion are we talking about here? Christian, Catholic, Moslem, Wicken?! What the fuck is a BLACK holiday?! Do you know of any \"WHITE\" holidays?  (sorry that's racist.. apparently..)\n\nMore over, WHY is this pertinent? Why is it important that I know holidays of YOUR ethnicity? Do you know any Korean holidays? Koreans are a minority in Austin. Shouldn't it be just as important that I know information about them? I guess not.. I was judged and given poor marks on this because I didn't know any black holidays.. I can go on and on about this hypocrisy but I wont.. this pissed me off a lot.. This black detective was in my mind a racist bastard and embodies everything you do NOT want in a police officer.\n\nQuestion Example: \"Two places have been burglarized. A little old lady on fixed income has had her TV stolen and a frat house has had its TV stolen. How would you treat them differently?\"\n\nThey are both victims of a crime yes? They both have had their TV stolen yes? I believe in the eyes of the law they both are deserving of equal and fair processing and help. I want to get both of them their TV's back.. This isn't enough information by a long shot.. And of course I was wrong.. They actually scoffed at me on this.. The psychologist was nice enough to try to explain the real answer.. This by the way is the ONLY \"correct\" answer I was given in the course of this debacle.\n\nThe correct answer is; \"The little old lady on fixed income is more important because she has no social interaction with the outside world other than her TV.. where as the frat house is most likely just trying to get the insurance... Why couldn't you figure that out.. you're a smart guy that has his own business and knows how to sell things, how come you couldn't figure this simple thing out?\" - Note I put this in quotes because this is exactly what he said.\n\nWhat the fuck?! First off.. fuck you.. Secondly you didn't give me that information.. Your question gave ZERO details.. when I asked for more, you didn't give them to me.. The Hispanic sergeant actually said \"sorry that's all the information we are giving you..\" You're asking me to tell you what I would do based solely on this information.. And based solely on that information I answered your question.. Correctly, in the eyes of the law, I might add.. But no, you want me to gleam some fictitious scenario that I have no way of arriving at.. This question was completely and utter crap.. Yet it is another in a long line of questions that ultimately failed me.\n\nQuestion Example: \"You catch a person cheating on an exam in the academy.. What do you do?\"\n\nI told them that I would confront the person about the cheating.. I would bring it up that I thought that what they were doing was wrong and that they shouldn't do it again..\n\nAdditional: \"What?! You wouldn't turn them in? It says in the rule book that anyone caught cheating will be expelled and its your responsibility to turn them in.. why wouldn't you turn them in?\" .... \"What if they did it again?\"\n\nNo I wouldn't turn them in the first time.. They scoffed again.. They couldn't believe I wouldn't turn them in immediately.. I explained to them that, while in the military the people around you are your life line.. They are the ones that will be in the fox hole with you.. You don't fuck your buddy.. In the end he is screwing himself and yes may very well be hurting you too.. but again I need more information.. I'm not willing to just say yes or no..\n\nHe may not have been cheating.. any number of things could have been going on.. And if he IS cheating.. The only way I could have known that is if I looked up and .... was cheating as well.. Rethink your questions guys..\n\nIf he continues then, yes I will turn him in.. but no I'm not willing to rush out and ruin someone's career because they make a mistake or a bad choice one time.. They of course went off on me for saying this.. and started in on me about some outlandish examples of why I was wrong..\n\nI know that while I was in the army the standard operating procedure is, if someone needs help.. you help them.. And like it or not, if you catch them doing something wrong, you don't turn them in for it immediately, but rather you try to sort it out on a local level.. You escalate if they keep screwing up..\n\nFucking racist detective from the above questions, every playing the antagonist, told me that I was lying.. He said, \" Don't give me that bullshit.. I was in the military the same time you were and they don't train you to lie..\" Again he actually said that.. This guy didn't like me much.. and I must admit.. I didn't care for him either.. You're right you schmuck, no where in the UCMJ does it say \"Don't fuck your buddy\".. but its a rule anyway.. and if you were in the military you knew that.. unless of course you were \"blue falcon\".. Which would explain a lot about you..\n\nI can go on for days.. There were a LOT more questions and I don't think I answered any of them to their satisfaction.. All of them were very open ended questions that didn't have a \"right\" answer.. Everything was extremely subjective..\n\nUpon first entering the room they told me \"Be honest.. don't tell us what you think we want to hear..\" Which is exactly what I did.. I was polite all the time and never lost my cool.. But I know now that wasn't what the wanted me to do.. They wanted me to tell them the \"right answers\".. Not the honest ones..\n\nIn closing, most of the questions were race orientated.. The seemed to revolve around my lack of racial experience.. In my mind.. I have none.. I worked with people of EVERY nationality while in the military and since, and frankly their race never entered into it.. We didn't care.. we worked together and were friends.. went to bars.. hung out sometimes.. etc.. If they feel its so important that I have some kind of social sensitivity training then they should give that to me in the academy.. that's what training is for..\n\nIn the end, I refuse to judge a person based on their race.. but in turn was judged..\n\n__Addendum - post law enforcement opinion__\n\nPosted: Oct 13, 2006\n\nI was a police officer from Sept. 2002 to Feb. 22, 2006 at two different departments. I stand by my above answers. The APD guys were wrong in their methods and were clearly only interested in weeding me out of their program. In the end, I don't regret my answers or the experience, but I think a lot less of APD because of it.\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2001-09-11-our-generations-pearl-harbor.md","url":"/our-generations-pearl-harbor/","relative_path":"_posts/2001-09-11-our-generations-pearl-harbor.md","id":"/our-generations-pearl-harbor","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Our generations Pearl Harbor?","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2001-09-11 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"our-generations-pearl-harbor","ext":".md"},"url":"/being-called-a-racist/","relative_path":"_posts/2001-10-25-being-called-a-racist.md","id":"/being-called-a-racist","collection":"posts","excerpt":"I refused to judge a person based on their race.. but in turn was judged and called a racist.","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Being called a racist...","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2001-10-25 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"being-called-a-racist","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2001-09-11-our-generations-pearl-harbor.md","output":null,"content":"I can't help but wonder what the world is coming to as I watch the news today.. Story after story about how several planes were hi-jacked and how two of which were intentionally crashed into the World Trade Center. Time and time again from lowly news reporter up to the President, they call it a cowardly act. And I agree.. It was.. But this isn't middle school.. Our calling them a coward wont goad them into revealing their guilt. So the question is, what do we do now? Personally I think its time we heal and cry for our dead..\n\nI know people that say we should bomb all of whomever the guilty parties are into a self lighting glass parking lot. And while we certainly have the power and resources to do that, would that solve anything? Or would it simply fuel the Anti-American sentiment that is prevalent in so many of the countries of the world?\n\nThe real problem is not the fighting of terrorism. If you kill the terrorist, there will always be 2 or 3 more to step up in his place. The news says we aren't fighting the terrorists as much as we are fighting their ideas. And if it were ideas then that would be fine as ideas can be changed. But this isn't the case either.. We are fighting beliefs.. Those aren't as easily changed.. So again, what do we do now? Do we take on their tactics and simply blow them up to prove our point.. I dunno.. I like the idea of letting those that want to live a certain way, live that way. I have no intention of forcing my beliefs on anyone.. But now we are at an impasse, as they (the terrorists) are forcing our hand..\n\nMaybe I am completely out of touch, but I don't understand the Anti-America sentiment that is floating around the middle east. Why do they hate us so much? Hate us so much that these people are willing to lay down their lives. I appreciate someone believing in something so strongly that they are willing to sacrifice themselves, but I don't know what their grief is. These extremist measures that these people are taking don't solve anything because it doesn't explain to us what their beef is.\n\nTo the terrorists, I ask:\n\nLets look at this realistically.. What has been solved today? Oh yeah.. You sure showed us... (?!?) What was the point? Why did thousands of people have to die? what were you trying to prove? That you could do it? Again I have to believe that there was SOME message or purpose there.. To destroy something just for the sake of destruction is stupid. It makes no sense at all.. And lastly, proves nothing.\n\nThis just isn't the way to get things solved. Now, it gets worse. By doing this it forces America to retaliate. America has always reacted very strongly to terrorist attacks and this will not be an exception to that rule. Thousands of innocent people died into days rash act of senseless violence.. And I promise you.. More will die before this ends.. And both sides are going to be very bloody..\n\nMaybe it's time we end it for good.. We have been told that we act like the police of the world. If the rest of the world didn't act like spoiled little children we probably wouldn't have too.. but that's fine.. You call us the police of the world, well maybe it's time we act like it.. I'm not talking occupation.. I'm not talking police actions.. You want war? Fine. We can simply treat you like any other spoiled child who is misbehaving.. I think it's time we paddle the middle east, once and for all. You have misbehaved for the final time here.. We aren't going to send you to your room without supper either.. It's time for a serious spanking..\n\nThis kind of shit will not be tolerated on American soil.. You made a mistake today.. You made a mistake in thinking that we wouldn't fight back.. You have made a very grave error.. Fear not, I know the American people, being the tough bunch that they are, can live with what you have wrought.. I also know, you will not..\n","previous":{"next":{"path":"_posts/2001-09-11-our-generations-pearl-harbor.md","url":"/our-generations-pearl-harbor/","relative_path":"_posts/2001-09-11-our-generations-pearl-harbor.md","id":"/our-generations-pearl-harbor","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Our generations Pearl Harbor?","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2001-09-11 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"our-generations-pearl-harbor","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2001-01-02-software-piracy.md","output":null,"content":"I got into another Software Piracy debate today..

I'd love to hear from each of the old school core posters telling everyone what the forum meant to you..  I know I personally got more out of it than I put in or I wouldn't have continued to do it..  ( and no I don't mean money -- I never made a cent.. )\n\nEither way, it was a good ride..  I want to give a personal thank you to all the users who made the forum what it was,  to the few that donated their time to upkeep as well as to the even fewer who donated money..  I also want to thank the core 50 and the hard core 20 who really provided the center around which we all revolved, you know who you are..\n\nI shall miss you all, and I wish you all the best.\n\nJason \"Palamedes\" Ellis\n<img style=\"border: 0px;\" title=\"Email Address\" src=\"/images/2008/06/email.gif\" alt=\"My Email Address\" width=\"146\" height=\"14\" />\n\n\n---\n\n###Legacy Comments\n\novjamaica - Oct 20, 2009 @ 12:40:32\n\n      To all of those I met and became friends with through the FFF, I must say a heartfelt thanks. I learned more about film production through this forum than through any other source. It’s sad to see the forum come down, but it seemed past its glory days for sure. I shall always remember the kind individuals that read my scripts, offered feedback on my effects tests, gave me advice about all kinds of topics, and listened to my own ramblings as I tried to coach others on their way to success. To all of my friends on the “other side of the pond” I want to thank you for your friendship. You darn Yanks were good friends too, and this isn’t the end of such friendships, just a change of venue. I expect to hear from all of you when you make it big.  Good luck to everyone in all that you do. If you ever need to get in touch with me, just google my name. It’s unique enough for you to find me.  Take care all.\n\n      Mike aka ovjamaica\n\nTeetee - Oct 21, 2009 @ 11:03:28\n\n      Sad and sorry we all got too busy!\n\nSpectre - Oct 21, 2009 @ 14:18:25\n\n      I’m guilty of drifting away in recent years but I always thought of the FFF as a great community of people. I’m still active in no-budget filmmaking and many of the skills and techniques that I use were learned from my friends on the board.\n\n      Jason, thanks for taking on the time and money burdens to host the board all these years. If anyone wants to keep in touch with me or collaborate on a project, please feel free to email me at kwkspectre@yahoo.com.\n\nRhino - Oct 21, 2009 @ 14:20:13\n\n      It’s a real shame but I understand the need to pull the plug. Thank you for the time, effort and of course money you invested in keeping it running, even when it began to seem not worth it. The FFF meant a lot to me, even though film making was never first on my agenda I still have an ambition to someday make a feature-length film. I learnt a lot of handy techniques and met some great friends who taught me much for when I finally realize this ambition. I went to the liberty of creating a group for all of our members on Facebook, just search for ‘Amateur Films Forum’. Hopefully we can find a way for it to carry on, in whatever form or capacity. Good luck to everyone in all your endeavours, especially film related! Take care.\n\n      Qasim aka Rhino\n\nBen (CN) - Oct 21, 2009 @ 17:52:14\n\n      Though I was only a member for about five years, they were a crucial five years, and in them I became an adult. With you people’s companionship, I grew from a fanatic blathering idiot to a nihilistic, muttering idiot, and for that I am thankful. From Utah to London, and probably some others outside my limited geographical knowledge, I made many true friends that I would not otherwise have met. They have enriched me, and, I like to think, I have enriched them even more, as I think we can all agree I was the coolest of all of us, and also the sexiest.\n\n      Except, perhaps, for Wondernerd.\n\n      With everlasting love,\n      C******** Ninja\n      CN\n      Ben\n\nDMail - Oct 23, 2009 @ 01:31:59\n\n      I was guided here from the FFF Facebook group, I hadn’t realized the forum had been taken down. I haven’t been around much in recent years, however, I grew up on the FFF. Since I was probably 12(?) I started posting on the original ezboard (none of you have any clue besides Jason), but I got to know many folks over the years and most all of them have gone on to other things since. I nearly shed a tear reading this, Jason as it occupied some 10 years of my life. Although fan films, and films in general, aren’t much of my life anymore, the films, knowledge, memories, and most of all the friends from this community will never be forgotten. Thank you all, and most importantly Jason for keeping it alive as long as you did. Feel free to add me on Facebook or whatnot.\n\n      Take care,\n      DMaul\n      Kyle\n\nNomAnor01 - Oct 23, 2009 @ 20:00:12\n\n      Been here as MysticTrunks and NomAnor for.. geez, must be 9-10 years now. Always enjoyed you guys and gals and even the only crappy SW fan stuff i tried back then. An amazing ride and great place for info from the ever famous Wondernerd.\n\n      Take care everyone and as Roland of Gilead would say, “Long days and pleasant nights to ya.”\n\n      Mike\n\nDave Macomber - Oct 23, 2009 @ 23:28:59\n\n      Wow.

I am saddend by the removal of the FFF and Hate to see it go. I remember the old ez board days when Japeth ran the place. I would be more than happy to take over the hosting and administration of the board as i have the bandwith and space to host it.\n\nJareth Dakk - Oct 26, 2009 @ 21:26:30\n\n      Well, as much as I hate to admit it, I guess you’re right, Pal. Would have loved to keep the novelization going!\n\nJbird669 - Oct 29, 2009 @ 12:59:12\n\n      I was very sad to be redirected to this page when I typed fanfilmsforum.com into my browser. I’ve made some friends and received a lot of good advice and the small amount I was able to give back hopefully helped.\n\n      Palamedes, your forum became my go-to site when other forums lost the ideals of what fan films are all about. Thanks for all of the blood, sweat, tears and cash you’ve put into the site. It’s made my writing and filmmaking better.\n\n      To the friends I’ve made, It is my sincere wish to stay in touch and hopefully collaborate on projects. While I don’t get to make as many as I’d like, I got my son involved in filmmaking, and now I’m also the VP of a film festival, thanks to the info I learned from you.\n\n      I’d love to hear from you. Drop me a line at jp@stunodpictures.com\n\nDouz - Oct 30, 2009 @ 16:25:22\n\n      Pal,\n\n      Thanks for all you have done with this board. Not only did it help in the completion of 2 SW Fan Films, but also helped us move on into the non-fan film world. Hell, you even helped point me in the right direction when I needed a board of my own for a class I was teaching. I met a lot of really good people here and wish you all the best of luck.\n\n      Scott\n\nBT - Gr'n Jalera - Oct 30, 2009 @ 17:34:18\n\n      Just found out about this. Haven’t been here in a long time but made a lot of good real life friends in the process. This site helped us to learn a lot about film making. I don’t think we could have even started our first project without this site.\n      Pal – you did an amazing thing for a long time by keeping this going, but as you said, it’s time has come.\n      Green Jello – signing off.\n\nBorjis Fett - Nov 05, 2009 @ 16:12:54\n\n      end of an era indeed!\n\n      The forum was a must visit for me daily when I began learning premiere and 3dsmax and wanted desperately to create a great fan film and hopefully lead to a job in post production….and it did. I’ve been working in the industry for 8 years now 9th coming up and its been a great career for me.\n\n      anyhoo it was a great place with great people and I’m sad that its over.\n\n      Good luck to all of you!\n      my best,\n      Chris Borges-Silva\n      Borjis Fett\n\nNetvudu - Nov 11, 2009 @ 06:41:06\n\n       (….ok.

You are my hero, bud.\n\nSWmaster - Nov 17, 2009 @ 10:26:53\n\n      I am sad to see my old haunt go. I had a lot of fun with you guys! After i got done with school I stopped doing fan film stuff for lack of time but I will never forget this place. The refuge from TFN.\n\n      Thanks Pal!\n\nAlanSmitheIII - Dec 03, 2009 @ 14:30:58\n\n      Sad to see it go…but it had become a shadow of it’s former self.\n\n      I started off with FanFilms here and on TFN….the Fan Films Golden Era. Met some people that stuck as (true) friends.\n\n      Peace out, everyone.\n\nShadow Wolf - Dec 04, 2009 @ 19:42:29\n\n      Although I hate to see it go, I must admit that my life has taken me away from the first forum I ever joined. I’ll miss you guys, and the forum.\n\n      *raises glass of cocoa*\n\n      Cheers!\n\n      Brandon (Shadow Wolf)\n\nChris - Jan 19, 2010 @ 03:26:55\n\n      Oh my gosh! I hadn’t checked the forum in a long time. I first met up with all of you when I was just a young lad. I think I was 13 or 14. I learned a lot there, and everybody really helped me enjoy video, the internet, and my youth. Such a strong community back then.\n\n      I eventually drifted away as school took more of my time and I started running around with some kids in town. Right now, though, I am in my last semester of film school at Columbia College Chicago and I think I owe all of you at least a little bit of thanks for fanning the flame when I was just starting to light the fire. You all rock!\n\n      And Jason (Pal), I still remember when you took over as the forum’s chief custodian. What an undertaking.\n\n      Y’know, when I look around today at sites like Vimeo and Youtube – sites I use often – I think back on what we were all doing and I think, really, we were a step ahead. We needed the community back then because we didn’t have the tools. Now the distribution and collaborative tools are available and communities are forming around them! It is a truly exciting time for creativity.\n\n      I invite any of you who remember me, or even those who don’t but want to get to know me, to join me on Vimeo. My profile is linked above.\n\n      I wish you all the best! I have such fond memories of our time together apart.\n\n      -Chris\n\n      (cbales)\n\nbluesh4rk - Feb 10, 2010 @ 22:56:24\n\n      Aw sad to see that FFF is no more. I myself remember the old days, they were lots of fun but life got in the way. I really had a hard time giving up Force Flicks and I can totally understand why you can’t take care of the FFF anymore. Hopefully everyone is doing well!\n\n      Jules (Joli, sh4rk, bluesh4rk)\n\nZayn - Feb 15, 2010 @ 22:09:31\n\n      I too drifted away. I got busy with life.\n\n      But I miss many of the people on here. A big chunk of you were around when I was still high school – and that was a long time ago.\n\n      Hit me up on my facebook or send me an email and I’ll let you know what I’ve been up to!\n\n      -Jen\n      Zayn_angel@hotmail.com <—this is my spam email so it might take a bit for me to reply, I'll send you my real one then\n\nSauja - Feb 16, 2010 @ 12:00:46\n\n      End of an era for sure Dave.\n\n      The enthusiasm of youth must give way to the realities of life.\n\n      It was a long ride. It was a good ride. So many laughs. So much creativity. So many dreams, some fulfilled, others not. But it was great to share those dreams with all of you. It made them seem more real.\n\n      It brings a smile to my face when I think of all the kids who have now grown up. I think of Sh4rk and Zayn, and DMaul who were mature beyond their years.\n\n      I remember the old guard. Names like Movie Maximus, Douz and G’rn, Clay, Hermes, AlanSmithee, NetVudu, Wondernerd, Melvil, SovereignKnight, Jason R.J.M., Jedi2016. (I’m forgetting so many, but google cache won’t show anything from fanfilmsforum.com and my work is blocking wayback machine).\n\n      Hats off to Japheth for creating our common home and to Palamedes for safeguarding it until now. I completely understand your decision, as sad as it makes me. (is it available in read-only mode somewhere, there was a wealth of information in those posts).\n\n      Cheers to you all. Hope you are well and happy.\n\nSauja - Feb 16, 2010 @ 19:51:48\n\n      At home I was able to have a look with web.archive.org and found a bunch of old names I’d forgotten:\n\n      Jedi_Rory, Saint Storyteller, Kreve Streak, Jedi Roara, goddess, Darth Brass, Tater, Han_Duet, Jareth Dakk and Tcheb.\n\n      Remember ScottMiddlebrook? and Dorkmanscott, and who can forget DMAN. KepowOb, and EdgeofNowhere. There was Anrev, and Bryan, and Crunchy, and sledgeweb.\n\n      I remeber Pszabo99, Xecuter666, Andrew Breecher, Jarn Tal and Khyron.\n\n      So many names. So many memories.\n\nChimi - Mar 03, 2010 @ 17:46:13\n\n      Not sure how many people here actually remember me. I kind of go way back. Back to even the ezboard days and then over to this forum. But for some reason I just figured I’d drop by and see what everyone was up to and I can honestly say I’m sad to see the board no longer in existence. I was going through my closet the other day, opening boxes of stuff from when I moved many years ago and came across my garb (X-Wing helmet and coveralls) I had purchased for the long planned, but never created Tales from the Holocron project. But anyway, hope everyone is doing well. Hello to those who remember me. Take care.\n\nJeffrey A. Haines - Mar 06, 2010 @ 14:36:37\n\n      The FFF was the first message board I ever joined! I started reading back in the ezboard days when I was just beginning to explore the world of video. I was just a kid, and it was great to interact with a community of people who all had the same budding interest.\n\n      I ended up going to college for Digital Media, and had some great experiences working with video, animation, and compositing for class projects, and on an internship where I helped to start the video program at Philly.com/The Philadelphia Inquirer. I get to create a lot of multimedia at my current job (and do some corporate video, and even some animation).\n\n      I owe a lot of who I am as a content designer today to my infancy at the FFF. I don’t think I was ever huge poster, and didn’t really get too far with the projects I was working on at the time, but I certainly learned a lot of basic film making skills, terminology, and a lot about the film making process–and a lot of other knowledge I still use almost daily.\n\n      Jason, and everyone else from the old days: Thanks for helping to facilitate such an important part of my upbringing, and for building the foundation of my career!\n\n      Jeff Haines\n      (aka Galax –I was such a huge nerd!)\n\nShmo Productions - Mar 19, 2010 @ 17:22:21\n\n      I feel like a dagger was placed into my heart and twisted. Reading these comments is WAY sad as I recall my own experience. I must have joined the forums when I was 14 just a young lad, and I learned so much stuff as I developed into a more professional videographer. It’s crazy how time has passed so fast. I’m 21 now! NUTS! Well thanks FFF.\n      and I’d like to cordially blame facebook and blogger for the death of this once great empire… Adeuix (however you spell it)\n\n      well if anyone wants to contact me. Shoot me an email hardbed34@gmail.com especially my Utah home boys! peice out!\n\nMelvil - May 01, 2010 @ 15:50:05\n\n    Wow, this was truly a difficult thing to find. I definitely understand taking the boards down, like so many others I too drifted away as my life changed, and it was always somewhat painful to see the activity decline in recent years. But like many others, this community played a huge part in my life. I couldn’t have been more than 13 or 14 when I joined, and I feel like I’ve grown up knowing a lot of you.\n\n    Many thanks to all the awesome people that made the FFF such a special place. I wish you all the very best.\n\nSledgeweb - Jun 01, 2010 @ 15:15:36\n\n    Wow, I do miss the old days. Pal, is the archive available online anywhere? I had some stuff on there I wouldn’t mind looking over again. Good times, great forum, great people! Hope you and everyone are doing well!\n\n    -Sledge\n\nJohn \"Movie Maximus\" Stratton - Jun 09, 2010 @ 14:08:18\n\n      Wow, I just got on and went to see what was up at the old forum since the last time I was here (I don’t even remember when the last time was). I’m sad to see it gone, but I can understand why.\n\n      Myself, and many others, have moved on to other things in life. I still remember the old days and the old friends, and always will.\n\n      I have a MySpace account, but rarely use it (about as often as I had been on the forum the last several years). I suppose I need to get a Facebook account one of these days, but somehow, I don’t see myself using it very much either. So many people I know are on it though, so maybe one day, just before it becomes obsolete, lol!\n\n      I just want to thank everyone who has ever been a part of the FFF over the years, you all are great friends and advisors! It was a great little corner of the internet we had for ourselves.\n\nepic movie - Aug 20, 2010 @ 10:52:17\n\n    But, this could be true, might its possible,\n\n    Well, as much as I hate to admit it, I guess you’re right, Pal. Would have loved to keep the novelization going!\n\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2000-01-01-tags.md","url":"/tags/","relative_path":"_posts/2000-01-01-tags.md","id":"/tags","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":[],"layout":"page","title":"Tags","tags":[],"status":"publish","type":"special","published":true,"date":"2000-01-01 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"tags","ext":".md"},"url":"/fan-films-forum/","relative_path":"_posts/2000-01-02-fan-films-forum.md","id":"/fan-films-forum","collection":"posts","excerpt":"Amateur / Fan Films Forum was created in back in early 2000  and was made up of a small community of amateur and fan film enthusiasts.. ","draft":false,"categories":[],"published":true,"type":"page","title":"Fan Films Forum","layout":"page","tags":[],"image":"/images/2009/10/fff.png","ribbon":null,"private":false,"date":"2000-01-02 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"fan-films-forum","ext":".md"},"url":"/portfolio/","relative_path":"_posts/2000-01-03-portfolio.md","id":"/portfolio","collection":"posts","excerpt":"<p>No content here because the portfolio layout has it all.</p>\n","draft":false,"categories":[],"published":true,"type":"special","title":"Portfolio","layout":"portfolio","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"private":true,"allow_comments":false,"date":"2000-01-03 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"portfolio","ext":".md"},"url":"/software-piracy/","relative_path":"_posts/2001-01-02-software-piracy.md","id":"/software-piracy","collection":"posts","excerpt":"I got into another Software Piracy debate today..
