GIF images are compressed using the Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) lossless data compression technique and as of 1989 and the GIF89a format can store multiple images in a single stream.  The GIF format uses a palette of up to 256 distinct colors from the 24-bit RGB color space.\n\n__Portable Network Graphics__, or PNG was created in the mid 90's and was created with the intention of improving upon and replacing the GIF format.  The PNG brings to the table the ability to have an alpha channel transparency which gives us a much wider range of transparency options.   The PNG also gives us a much wider range of color depths than GIF (truecolor up to 48-bit compared to 8-bit 245-color), which allows for greater color precision and smoother fades..etc..  In just about every way the PNG is superior to the GIF, save one.  PNG's do not support storing multiple images in a single file.\n\n__Joint Photographic Experts Group__, or JPEG was a group who got together and issued a graphical standard (of the same name) back in the early 90's.  It's commonly used for compressing photographic images and allows for an adjustable degree of compression.  This adjustment gives the user a tradeoff between storage size and image quality.\n\n__In my opinion__,  any more for your small graphics I'd use PNG.  PNG's are far superior to GIF's in that they can achieve greater compression, have a \"cleaner\" compression algorithm, have wider range of color, more transparency options, and are very easy to work with.\n\nThe PNG's major down fall was it's lack of full support from Microsoft -- hell they used to crash IE4..  However, as of IE7 support is native (with full alpha transparency) and once IE6 hits its end of life (which I personally think needed to happen back in August of 2001) there really is only one reason to use a GIF and that's for animations.

The modern flock of javascript obfuscators will also go through and replace every command and variable in the file with some random key that points to an array which then gets eval'd back out at run time.  Generally speaking the code you see in an obfuscated javascript file looks like completely gobbledygook which is sorta the point.\n\nMy stance on it is simple;  Don't do it -- If you ever catch me encoding or obfuscating my javascript, come kick me square in the jimmy.  I simply cannot abide by people who think they need be secretive with javascript.  And lets be completely honest here, that's what it's about.\n\nSome folks will try to sling a steaming pile by saying it's to shrink the file size for bandwidth purposes, but that's crap -- most .jpgs on this site are larger than its javascript.  Most servers gzip everything before sending it to the client anyway so any file size benefits gained by obfuscation is nearly nil -- unless you've written war and peace in the comments of the file.\n\nJavascript obfuscation is purely about power -- People who think they are smart and have done something they want to be noted for obfuscate their code to play the pointless and asinine game of \"knowledge is power\".  They yammer on about how they don't want anyone to \"steal it\" -- which is again a steaming pile of shash.\n\nObfuscation is at best like a padlock on a door -- \"it keeps the honest people honest\" as my father would say. if someone wants it their gonna take it. More over, javascript on some webpage SHOULD be free and open.\n\nMost of these folks fail to realize that they themselves wouldn't be able to write the code in the first place if there wasn't a \"view source\" button.  Myself included -- And now you've written something you think is so awesome and innovative you need to hide it?!  Douche.\n\nBy obfuscating, all you're doing is refusing to give back to the community and saying \"fuck you\" to the very system that trained you to begin with.  You are stifling innovation in the industry, screwing over the little guy who doesn't know as much, and making yourself look like an ass, and generally speaking you should hang your head.\n\nAll of us are the modern day equivalent to shade tree mechanics.

And just about all of them has brought to the fore of my mind the glaring fact that there is nothing they have done that I can't do.   Seriously.  More over, I think I can do it better in just about every way.\n\nOne of the games I find myself playing is a space game which, to be fair, isn't very good -- in fact it's bad.  It's just not a very good game, yet for some reason I find myself continuing to play it -- as does a lot of other folks.  It's strangely popular.   While playing at just about every turn I see things that could not only be done a little better, but done WAY better.   Not just game play wise, but technically as well.  Their HTML is bad, they clearly don't understand CSS and their PHP is poorly written (from what I can tell.)  So, this of course always lead me to the line of thinking that, why shouldn't I try to make my own?\n\nI have a lot of irons in the fire right now so it would happen after I get the WPMU thing up and working, but if they can make a popular game, and it's in that condition -- anything I make should be at least as popular.\n\nI want to make a game, everyone knows that.  I want to make a space game, most know that too.   I already have some ideas as to the game itself, but the majority of the time my idea was to make a game in C/C++/Java or some other language than the one that I'm familiar with.\n\nI think this outlines a colossal error in my thinking..  I'm a professional developer of web applications.. I consider myself to be an expert in php, javascript, xhtml, css, etc..   I should use those, since its what I know.   It's only a minor rewrite of my core ideas to make them come inline with a web based game.\n\nThe hard part will be figuring out the specifics..  I mean web based games by their very nature are turn based games so this is the paradigm you're stuck with.. if I can adopt my ideas to a turn based game then we are good to go!\n\nI'd love to see a Masters of Orion like game made into a web based game, but how would that work?  That game has a definite start and end to it and it seems to me that most games that work that would would tend towards alienating your players every time the game \"ends\" and restarts..\n\nI almost lean towards a persistent world where by the game doesn't end, it just continues on.\n\nI'll have to ponder this..
