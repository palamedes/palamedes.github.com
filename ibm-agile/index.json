And just about all of them has brought to the fore of my mind the glaring fact that there is nothing they have done that I can't do.   Seriously.  More over, I think I can do it better in just about every way.\n\nOne of the games I find myself playing is a space game which, to be fair, isn't very good -- in fact it's bad.  It's just not a very good game, yet for some reason I find myself continuing to play it -- as does a lot of other folks.  It's strangely popular.   While playing at just about every turn I see things that could not only be done a little better, but done WAY better.   Not just game play wise, but technically as well.  Their HTML is bad, they clearly don't understand CSS and their PHP is poorly written (from what I can tell.)  So, this of course always lead me to the line of thinking that, why shouldn't I try to make my own?\n\nI have a lot of irons in the fire right now so it would happen after I get the WPMU thing up and working, but if they can make a popular game, and it's in that condition -- anything I make should be at least as popular.\n\nI want to make a game, everyone knows that.  I want to make a space game, most know that too.   I already have some ideas as to the game itself, but the majority of the time my idea was to make a game in C/C++/Java or some other language than the one that I'm familiar with.\n\nI think this outlines a colossal error in my thinking..  I'm a professional developer of web applications.. I consider myself to be an expert in php, javascript, xhtml, css, etc..   I should use those, since its what I know.   It's only a minor rewrite of my core ideas to make them come inline with a web based game.\n\nThe hard part will be figuring out the specifics..  I mean web based games by their very nature are turn based games so this is the paradigm you're stuck with.. if I can adopt my ideas to a turn based game then we are good to go!\n\nI'd love to see a Masters of Orion like game made into a web based game, but how would that work?  That game has a definite start and end to it and it seems to me that most games that work that would would tend towards alienating your players every time the game \"ends\" and restarts..\n\nI almost lean towards a persistent world where by the game doesn't end, it just continues on.\n\nI'll have to ponder this.. I'm pretty keen on it.\n","collection":"posts","url":"/web-based-games/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2008-07-07-play-the-radio.md","collection":"posts","url":"/play-the-radio/","path":"_posts/2008-07-07-play-the-radio.md","id":"/play-the-radio","draft":false,"categories":["Hobbies","RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"I can play the radio...","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2008/07/sticks.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-07-07 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"play-the-radio","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2008-06-30-web-based-games.md","excerpt":"So I find I have been playing quite a few web based games of late.

When I was in middle and high school I was in band and played everything from the trombone to the baritone and tuba but my musical aspirations sorta died there.   So it's not that I don't have skill, or that I can't learn -- I just haven't.   I know many folks that are completely tone deaf, I'm not one of those.  I just haven't had the time/inclination to invest into learning a musical instrument.\n\nMy lack of musical skills came gallingly apparent one year at Halloween when everyone in the company showed up playing some instrument or another -- and I had nothing of the sort.  One of the co-workers asked with complete honesty and earnest, \"What instrument do you play?\" as if it were a foregone conclusion that I had to play something..\n\nMy response was, \"I can play the radio..\"  Which got a chuckle from everyone who heard it, but it left me a little hollow inside.  I really do want to learn something I just am not sure what.  Or rather, I wasn't.\n\nFirstly, why did the aspirations die?   Well band in middle school was something we did to get the required credit and to avoid any sort of P.E. ~ I'm lazy and playing an instrument sounded a lot more fun that running laps around a track.  And while it filled that need nicely, it really did nothing to foster musical desires or competency on my part and I largely didn't enjoy it..\n\nI think the primary reason for my lack of enthusiasm was that I wanted to play the saxophone, but was assigned the trombone.  Back then the players had virtually NO choice..  Had I showed up with a sax of my own and could form the correct embouchure I'm sure I would have been a shoe in, but since we didn't own a sax and I had no clue what an <a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/embouchure\" target=\"_blank\">embouchure</a> was;  I wasn't even remotely in the running for the job.  I was handed a trombone and told to go sit down -- I made do.  But I didn't like it.\n\nI enjoyed the baritone more, but didn't get to play it for long before they decided they needed me carrying the sousaphone around.  That effectively ended my band career in my mind.   I quit the band and spent the next 4 years swimming on the swim team.. Hey at least I wasn't running laps ~ just swimming them.  Low impact I tell ya! (trying to put a positive spin on it)\n\nSo whats changed?  Well.. Nothing.  I still don't play anything and really would like to.  It's something that I want to get into as a hobby.  Just something I can piddle around with.\n\nPart of the issue is my other major hobby is software engineering -- programming.  I very much enjoy programming and it's something I do often, but it's also what I do for a living.  And nothing will rob you of a hobby more than being forced to do it.\n\nSo I need a new hobby.  My usual waste of time comes in the form of playing games, but that's still massive amounts of time with 'ass in chair' really not expanding my horizons.. Playing games is fine and all but it doesn't broaden the mind much.  Entertaining, sure.. Growth educing, not so much..\n\nSo this has made me want to look at musical instruments again.  I have always had a fondness for music and really would like to learn to make my own.  When I listen to music I often imagine myself playing the instruments and what that must feel like..\n\n<img class=\"pull-right\" title=\"Yamaha s90\" src=\"/images/2008/07/s90.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" />I thought for a long time that I'd like to learn to play the piano, and even got one.  I have a very nice <a href=\"http://www.yamaha.com/yamahavgn/CDA/ContentDetail/ModelSeriesDetail/0,,CNTID%25253D2709%252526CTID%25253D206500%252526CNTYP%25253DPRODUCT,00.html\" target=\"_blank\">Yamaha S90</a> piano that I really have never learned to use.\n\nIt's an excellent piano with all manner of very nice bells and whistles, but for what ever reason it didn't inspire me like I thought it would.\n\nI tried, and had a friend start to teach me but it just didn't do anything for me.  It was a bit daunting of course because of all the various buttons, dials and widgets but so long as you just focused on the piano keys themselves it was fine.  It played nicely as far as I could tell but I really didn't get much out of it.   I certainly didn't do it any justice and at this point its a shame the machine isn't being better used.  I don't feel it was too hard for me, it just didn't inspire me.\n\nI still very much like the idea of learning to play the piano but it still doesn't grip me like I thought it would.  I think each person to their instrument and this one simply isn't mine.\n\nFor a long time I wanted to learn to play the guitar and that still entertains me to some degree but no more so than the piano.  I know several folks who play the guitar and even dated a woman many years ago who was into it..  Classical acoustic guitar sounded very warm and soulful and I think would be a lot of fun to play.  I may still get one at some point, but it doesn't really drag me away from my other hobbies right now.\n\nI was digging around on the internet when I stumbled across the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapman_Stick\" target=\"_blank\">Chapman Stick</a> being played by <a href=\"http://myspace.com/robmartino\" target=\"_blank\">Rob Martino</a> in his song <a href=\"http://youtube.com/watch?v=_JjimMO2SdE\" target=\"_blank\">\"One Cloud\" on You Tube</a>..  Nice job Rob.  Well done my friend.\n\nThis instrument has been around since the mid 70's but is completely new to me.  I never new it existed until recently (a couple months ago now).  When I saw Rob playing it though I immediately recognized it as a \"Baliset\" which I thought was a completely fictional instrument played by Gurney Halleck (Patrick Stuart) in David Lynch's move Dune.\n\nThis was a favorite movie of mine when I was a younger man and so I had seen the Baliset scene many times. So, I was stunned to find that the Baliset was a real instrument, sorta.\n\nI've been looking into this for a couple months now and the chapman stick really kind of speaks to me.  One thing I like about it is that, from everything I have read it is the perfect amalgamation of keyboard and guitar -- in one.\n\nI am going to keep looking into it, but I think I'd like to learn to play one.   So far from what I have seen they are brutally expensive.. but I have a nice keyboard I can sell in order to get one, or atleast part way to one.\n\nI have read a couple folks say that learning the guitar first is good, while others say because of the \"free hands\" tap method used to play it learning the guitar first is actually a hindrance..   I don't know of course.. and comments are welcome..\n\nI'm going to keep looking into it though.. I have nothing but time so this is no rush.. but I think I'd like to learn the stick.  Getting setup with one might be the hard part.. but eventually..\n\nIf not the stick then something else.. I know that most of this is likely a pipedream, but I want to learn something.. I need to unplug a tad from all my gaming and programming ~ this seems a good direction..\n","collection":"posts","url":"/play-the-radio/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2008-07-07-play-the-radio.md","collection":"posts","url":"/play-the-radio/","path":"_posts/2008-07-07-play-the-radio.md","id":"/play-the-radio","draft":false,"categories":["Hobbies","RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"I can play the radio...","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2008/07/sticks.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-07-07 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"play-the-radio","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2008-07-13-ibm-agile.md","content":"<img class=\"pull-right\" title=\"IBM Blue logo\" src=\"/images/2008/07/ibm-logo-big-blue.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" />\n\nSo I have been pretty busy of late.

I have enjoyed it but will be happy to move on to something else..  City of heroes is one of my \"stand by\" games.  I find that I always come back to it simply because its quite mindless.. Good but simple..\n\nOr is it?  The more I play it the more I find super secret hidden stuff that is in the background.  I'm discovering that there is a lot of depth in the game that I never realized was there.\n\nIt made me realize that CoH/CoV took the EQ1 style of game play to heart, instead of the WoW style.  Meaning that in World of Warcraft if the guy standing there doesn't have an exclamation or question mark over his head -- you don't need to talk to him, ever..\n\nIn EQ1 that wasn't the case at all.. In fact if you didn't talk to just about everyone, you missed all the good quests.  I think it added a lot to the sense of accomplishment, but the cost of having to run around and talk to everyone was pretty high and kinda sucked.\n\nCity of Heroes has both methods employed.  You have a list of contacts which you can talk to or even call in order to do quests.. but there are also super secret ninja monkey heroes in the world that you have to go find..  This means that there are levels of depth to the game -- you don't have to do the super secret stuff.. or you can..   You choose.\n\nThat's pretty cool.  Plus with the invention system and the set powers they have going now, you can further refine your characters abilities.  You don't have to..but you can if you want to..   The neat thing about the set inventions is that they get stupidly powerful..\n\nI recently got my toon fully outfitted with the \"Blizzard\" power with a complete set on it.  Aim + Build up + Ice Storm + Blizzard... wow.. lots of shit dies very quickly.   Suddenly that pack of 20 orange mobs isn't a problem, and I'm just one guy.\n\nIt's a fun game.. but eventually I'll get tired of it and cancel my account... until I need something new and reactivate it.. haha.. I have done this like 5 times at this point..\n\nCurrently I am trying to get City of Heroes to work under Ubuntu.  I'm going through another cycle where windows has pissed me off, so back to Ubuntu.  I've already replaced my secondary computer with a mac mini (formerly an old windows box), if windows doesn't knock it off I'll just stay Ubuntu.\n\nEither way it shouldn't be too hard -- I'll keep you posted.  Right now its downloading.  2.5 gigs takes a little while.  I tried the \"move it from the windows partition\" trick but the patcher just didn't understand.  So fine.. download the thing again.. whatever..\n\nPs. Whatever you do -- don't install Vista.  And don't install IE8 on XP. Wine runs most windows programs better than windows.  As soon as I get a couple more of them working I may not go back.\n\nUpdate:  Well it works.  I don't know why it surprises me but it always does..  I guess I'm still programmed to think that you have to have the OS printed on the box in order to run the application..\n\nI had to completely reinstall it from the updater which confused me because it was replacing the exact same files with brand new files.. in the same place..  *shrug*  Oh well it took an hour longer than I had anticipated.. wooptie do..\n\nIt works very smoothly and so far I can't tell that I'm not in windows..   Wine, rocks.\n\nThe only bug is that the mouse cursor looks like its been \"de-interlaced\".. After doing some looking, this is a known issue and one I care less about.  It still works just fine, it just looks like the mouse has been sliced up horizontally..\n","collection":"posts","url":"/city-of-heroes-and-ubuntu/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2008-07-14-city-of-heroes-and-ubuntu.md","collection":"posts","url":"/city-of-heroes-and-ubuntu/","path":"_posts/2008-07-14-city-of-heroes-and-ubuntu.md","id":"/city-of-heroes-and-ubuntu","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"City of Heroes and Ubuntu","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2008/06/cohgamebox-150x150.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":true,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-07-14 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"city-of-heroes-and-ubuntu","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2008-07-17-dr-horribles-sing-along-blog.md","content":"<img class=\"pull-right\" title=\"Dr. Horrible\\'s Sing-Along Blog\" src=\"/images/2008/07/drhorriblesvertical.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"120\" height=\"240\" />\n\n<a href=\"http://drhorrible.com\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog</a> is just plain.. LEGEN-DARY!  (er.. sorry.. wrong show)..  Joss Whedon put together this little internet mini-series during the writers strike and its really very good.\n\nIt stars Neil Patrick Harris (commonly known as Doogie Howser) as Dr. Horrible, Nathan Fillion (Malcom Reynolds or the wrong private Ryan) as Captain Hammer (\"Corporate Tool\" hehe), and Felicia Day (Buffy, and The Guild) as Penny, Dr. Horribles love interest.  It's spread out over 3 episodes spanning a grand total of about 40 minutes..\n\nIn an attempt to test the waters, joss and crew have decided to release this pony for free over the course of the next couple of days, then to offer it for sale.  One week only!!  Posted initially on the 15th, they stay free until the 20th then go for sale..  I love this idea.. One week, get the word out.. then see who comes and buys it.  I would.. its good!\n\nIn fact, I'm stunned at how good it is.. hehe I shouldn't be, I mean Joss is great -- just watch firefly, serenity, buffy..etc.. (Damn you fox!)  But this is a good little show..  I wish it were longer.. (Sorta like Firefly.. But I digress..)\n\nI love musicals.. I dunno why.. I know its not manly, I don't care.  I really enjoy them and when they are comical, they are even better.   This was a fantastic show with just the right amount of music.. More over they were all really well done!\n\nAnd while I do like Nathan Fillion, I think Neil Patrick Harris completely stole the show.  He was great!  He makes me want to be in the Evil League of Evil!  I had no idea he could sing! It was fun seeing Simon Helberg show up as \"Moist\"..heh  I'm enjoying him on Big Bang Theory.. (did he do your piano work?)\n\nNathan's \"Moral dilemma\" song (end of act 2) was fantastic and probably my favorite.  The end of act 1 song was good too..  Oh and Joss, Loved the chair.. heh  I also really loved the whole bad horse stuff.. that was funny as hell..\n\nThis whole thing was done on a shoe string budget but you wouldn't know to look at it.  I mean the camera work looked great, the lighting and sound were fine.  More over they got excellent talent and whoever wrote the songs was great!  Lots of counterpoint which was fun.\n\nVery well done though guys.. kudos!  I wish it was longer than 3 episodes -- BALLS!\n\nOn a side note, I'd love to see numbers as to how much this actually cost.  Down to equipment, stars, etc.. maybe show us the original script etc..  Really use this as a lesson to the \"fan films\" and Amateur films community to show us really how its done.  That sort of thing would be of interest to everyone and I think they'd pay to see the 'behind the scenes' stuff..  I know I would.\n","collection":"posts","url":"/dr-horribles-sing-along-blog/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2008-07-26-warhammer-and-warhammer-online.md","collection":"posts","url":"/warhammer-and-warhammer-online/","path":"_posts/2008-07-26-warhammer-and-warhammer-online.md","id":"/warhammer-and-warhammer-online","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Warhammer and Warhammer Online","layout":"post","tags":["Warhammer"],"image":"/images/2008/07/runtherd.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-07-26 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"warhammer-and-warhammer-online","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2008-07-17-dr-horribles-sing-along-blog.md","excerpt":"Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog is LEGEN-DARY!
