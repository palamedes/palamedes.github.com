<p>I have experience teaching my computer skills to others and I enjoy a challenge.</p>

<h3 id="personal-hobbies">Personal Hobbies</h3>

<p>I don’t idle well.  I can’t sit around and do nothing, as such I’m always doing something; usually making something.  I’m an avid woodworker and I enjoy building things.  I am always out in my garage puttering and tinkering on building something and also have an active Youtube Channel around my Van’s RV-10 Experimental Aircraft build.</p>

<h3 id="law-enforcement-and-software-">Law Enforcement and Software ?!?</h3>

<p>People often wonder how one goes from Software development to Law enforcement, and back, and back again!  I get that question a lot.  The <abbr title="Too Long, Didn't Read">TL:DR</abbr> is that after selling my first company I decided to make a radical career change in order to recapture some of that camaraderie that I was missing from the military and encourage a buddy of mine that was getting out of the Army at the time to go too.  I found a brotherhood of like minded individuals who did a hard job that was rewarding but in the long run due to a very hostile work environment (the department itself) I had to make a change.  I went back into software and spun up a couple companies before burning out completely.  I went back to law enforcement again just as something to do.  Feel free to ask I can go into this further.</p>
