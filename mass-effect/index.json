A whole year has gone by in the blink of an eye! It must be magic, cause it really went by fast and everything is still peachy.. More over, for our anniversary gifts to one another we both managed to get the same card, from different stores.. in different cities.. heh\n\nEither we are perfect for one another or both of these stores need a better stock of cards.. heh Considering the vast number that were at my store, I choose the \"we are perfect for one another\" option.\n\nFor our anniversary I got her dough nuts, and we had fishsticks.. Er.. okay kidding about the fishsticks.. Not the dough nuts.. heh.. It's sort of an inside joke, but the long and short of it is; we stayed up until 4am and I got up at 7am and got her her favorite dough nuts.. I was punch drink and woosey while driving the 30 minutes to and from the store..\n\nFor dinner we went to <a href=\"http://www.fogodechao.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Fogo de Chão</a> (fo-go dèe shoun) in downtown Austin.. This restaurant is fantastic! They stuff you full of meat, and then when you cant possibly hold any more, they shove in an extra hand full and call it \"dessert\". Seriously, the chef's walk around with large spits of meat and cut you off a slice as they walk by. It was great! Pricey as all hell, but damn good.\n\n<a title=\"Cheese Cake and Flan\" rel='lightbox' href='/images/2008/06/cheesecakeandflan.jpg' class='fancybox pull-left'><img src=\"/images/2008/06/cheesecakeandflan-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Cheese Cake and Flan\" /></a>\n\nAnd, whats more .. even with as much beef, lamb, chicken, and .. god any other animal you care to mention in our stomach's my lovely and skinny wife still managed to skoff down some cheesecake! I had the flan.. =) it was yummy.\n\nAfterwards Mel and I both had meat hangovers for a couple days.. heh\n","collection":"posts","url":"/its-been-a-year-already/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2008-06-12-3g-iphone.md","collection":"posts","url":"/3g-iphone/","path":"_posts/2008-06-12-3g-iphone.md","id":"/3g-iphone","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"3G iPhone","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2008/06/3giphone.png","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-06-12 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"3g-iphone","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2008-06-02-its-been-a-year-already.md","excerpt":"So I can't believe I have been married for a year already!

I mean its an improvement, but its not a super vast improvement..  The 2 major things the new hardware brings to the table are 3G networking, and GPS.  Both of which for me mean very little.\n\nMy current iPhone's 2G networking works great for me.  I mean so what if it takes 60 seconds to load a webpage instead of 30 seconds.. (Or 59 to 23 or whatever it was.. )  I just don't mind waiting that couple extra seconds.. its not that big of a deal.\n\nThe GPS sounds like a fun little toy, but to be honest once again, I don't see the value of GPS in a phone.  I have no need of that tool.  The location system now is ample -- maybe I would change my story once I got to play with one that was fully GPS enabled, but right now it seems like an extra battery drainer that has no real value.  If you were out in the woods, and needed a GPS antenna, you'd likely get a REAL GPS device that gives true coordinates.. etc..\n\nNow having said that, they are lowing the price of the hardware to $199..  Wow... just.. Wow..  okay that's awesome.. in fact that's not awesome, that's nuts!  Clearly they are taking a loss on this device.. they must be!  I'd be interested it knowing what the cost to Apple is for a single iPhone.  I bet its pretty high.\n\nSome folks are saying that its a complete slap in the face of those folks who have already purchased an iphone at the much higher price, but I don't see it that way.  I mean if you go buy a car, computer or any other kit of hardware you KNOW its going to be worth less the instant you get it.  You should expect it.  Maybe having it thrust in your face as harshly as this is the issue, but I just don't see it that way.\n\nThe $400 for our iphones probably went a long way towards making the $200 iphone even possible.  Had the $400 iphone been a flop, you wouldn't see the cheaper version today.\n\nWhat I'm really looking forward to is the software upgrades..  The application store looks fantastic beyond all reason.  I love it!  I really want to not only download software, but create software that others can use..  In Apples most recent keynote speech they had a demo of some software by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typepad\" target=\"_blank\">typePad</a> -- a competitor to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordpress\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress</a> -- that allows users to create blog entries on the fly.  It looked great and I'd love to try to make one for WP!\n\nThey are also adding a lot of enterprise support which to me makes it pretty clear that Steve Jobs and Apple are extremely keen on cutting the legs out from under <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_In_Motion\" target=\"_blank\">Research in Motion</a> and their blackberry.   Smart.\n\nThere is a lot of money there, and I think they can do it.  The iphone is the latest cool wizbang hotness that I think could easily be on top in a year.\n\nMore over, with the price point of $200 I bet you're going to see a lot of customers using the iphone as a computer for devices.  Think about robots, car computers, or just fun tech toys.  Here you have an extremely small BSD device with phone, wi-fi, bluetooth, camera, gps..etc.. I mean its the perfect device for .. uh.. anything.\n\nThe next year for the iphone should be damn fun to watch!\n","collection":"posts","url":"/3g-iphone/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2008-06-12-3g-iphone.md","collection":"posts","url":"/3g-iphone/","path":"_posts/2008-06-12-3g-iphone.md","id":"/3g-iphone","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"3G iPhone","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2008/06/3giphone.png","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-06-12 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"3g-iphone","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2008-06-13-mass-effect.md","content":"<img class=\"pull-right\" title=\"Mass Effect PC Box Cover\" src=\"/images/2008/06/256px-masseffect_box_cover-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Mass Effect PC Box COver\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" />Being the avid PC gamer that I am, I wasn't about to go and buy an XBox 360 back in Nov.

KILLS YOU!  heh, harsh.  But then I guess this is a desert memory and he can't swim.\n\nI'm not sure how slowing down and ducking your head makes you less conspicuous.. but.. it does.  This really is the only mechanic I don't understand, but then how else would you provide a button that allows you to \"fly casual\".\n\nControls are extremely unintuitive and border on confusing.  Especially for a PC gamer who doesn't play console games.  You can really tell that this is a console game that was ported to PC where the controls are concerned.. The main issue is there is a LOT of things you can do and they try to do all of them with some combination of 4 buttons.\n\nWhile the controls for the game are unintuitive and confusing, they give you quite a lot of options both in and out of combat.  And I don't care who you are, sneaking up to an archer on the top of a building and pushing him off to watch him fall to his death is good wholesome fun.  You will eventually realize that you can be extremely \"loose\" with controlling your character and he'll usually behave the way you wanted.\n\nThis is something that most PC players will have a hard time with simply because they are used to micro-managing their characters, as opposed to console games which will partly play themselves.\n\nThe graphics engine seems a tad unoptimized as I get a solid 60fps (with vsync) but there is video lag and jumpiness.. Also the game is beautiful, yet it has no ingame option for anti-aliasing.  This is a common trend of game makers lately and it boggles the mind.  Games with AA look so much better than without, but most of them don't use AA.  It saddens me.  Forcing AA through the control panel has odd and unplayable results.\n\nThat's really it.    Most of my complaints are pretty minor.  The game is a lot of fun and most likely will be one that I finish.  (For me that's a sign of a good game.)\n\nOh and Chad, my computer gets a solid 60fps in most places though in a couple of the way up high views were you see everything, it dips into the 50s.  =)   Max graphics baby!   *sniff* I love my computer..\n","collection":"posts","url":"/assassins-creed/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2008-06-14-assassins-creed.md","collection":"posts","url":"/assassins-creed/","path":"_posts/2008-06-14-assassins-creed.md","id":"/assassins-creed","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Assassins Creed","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2008/06/256px-assassins_creed.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-06-14 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"assassins-creed","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2008-06-15-age-of-conan-annoys-me.md","content":"<img class=\"pull-right\" title=\"Age of Conan\" src=\"/images/2008/06/age_of_conan_cover-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" />\n\nI'm starting to get upset / annoyed with Age of Conan.  Probably it's more fair to say, disappointed -- but you can only scream at your monitor for so long before disappointment spirals down into something else. \n\nMy main character is a ranger -- and as with all games that have a ranger class, he's broken.  Primarily when it comes to damage output. \n\nI understand that a ranger, being a subset of the rogue class, can't tank.  I'm there.  In EQ1 rangers were made of paper.. I'm cool with that.. But the ranger should be able to put out some damage, and since they can't tank, they should be able to put out damage at range.  If they can't for any reason do ranged damage, what's the point of a ranger?   \n\nIn AoC the ranger can melee, use a bow, or use a crossbow.   Melee with an AoC ranger is a joke -- don't waste your time.  Crossbow has some nice damage, but its slow damage -- and the majority of the skills are for bow not crossbow.  You're really best using a bow.\n\nOkay fine. I'll use a bow -- which is what I wanted in the first place.  The issue is with the various attack abilities with a bow, most of them are broken.\n\n__Salvo__\nThe number one issue, and the number one skill used by a bow ranger is \"Salvo\".  Salvo pisses me off to no end.\n\nSalvo is a 3 key combo  -- Meaning you poke the \"Salvo\" hot key, then you have to do two directional attacks in order to get the full combo (and thus the full damage) to fire off.  The problem is that salvo, as the name implies, fires more shots than you press keys for.\n\nThe first salvo hot key fires one shot usually straight initiating the combo.  The second key fires one shot either left or lower left, to try to get them to refocus their shields. And the third key fires 3 shots straight -- but it does 3 individual attacks, its not like you knock up 3 arrows and fire them all at once.\n\nIt's this third key that is the problem in that if anything interrupts your third key and those 3 attacks, the mob gets all the health back that he lost due to the combo.   This could be over a thousand points of health he just suddenly gets back.. *pop*  Insta-heal.\n\nFurther more, if you kill him on the first shot of the salvo, he still does damage to you until the entire combo finishes.  It takes about 8 seconds for the entire combo to resolve itself and I have died many times during that 8 seconds to a mob that was DEAD but still swinging.. \n\nAnd of course if they kill you this way, they are suddenly full health and back standing there!!\n\nIf the mob dodges or you \"miss\" with the first shot of the salvo, ALL shots of the salvo miss. Time well spent.\n\nSalvo needs to be fixed.. But so far they wont even acknowledge that it's a bug.\n\n__Some shots don't register at all__\nSometimes you will go through the combo keys and nothing happens on the final key.  No \"Miss\" text, no \"Mob is too far away\" text, nothing.. just.. nothing.  You're left standing there wondering why the hell the mob didn't just take damage.  Time well spent.  \n\n__No Range__\nThe ranger also has ZERO RANGE!  It kills me how short ranged the bow is.. A bow in AoC has about a 50 foot range.  (Hard to say how many \"feet\" it actually is, but it aint far.)  I'm not saying the bow should have a 300 yard range, but it should have a longer range than it does.  It's down right silly how short it is, and makes a rangers life suck as you basically have to get into melee range to shoot.\n\nGive us some room to shoot folks!\n\n__Different Range First Person to Third Person__\nWhat?!  I want to know who the smacktard was that thought it was a good idea to give the bow and crossbow a different range based on first person or third person shooting.  What bone head thought this was a good idea?\n\nWhy does my bow have a range half again as long when in first person?  Why does my bow's combo's have a very short range, yet I can key up an arrow to fire at any range? etc..  This is just stupid.. \n\n__Shooting from a ledge__\nOne of the missions early on tells you that you need to go stop the mobs from shooting their bows from a ledge high up, because it's killing the good guys.  SO you rush up there, kill them, only to realize that .. hey, this is a good spot to snipe back at the bad guys too!\n\nSo, you target up a mob and let fly.. Only to see them constantly evade..  You have line of sight, you have range.. you are above them though and they \"can't get to you\" so instead of letting you murder them fair and square, they just evade,evade,evade like a broken mob.  \n\nThis is fucked up.. The whole point of the mission was to stop them from doing this, only to find out that YOU can't do this.   WHY?!  If I can get up on this ledge, so can they -- as proven by the fact that THEY WERE UP HERE FIRST!  This is just down right stupid and breaks the game to me.  You say you want players to be clever and try new things, then break the new things we try.  What bullshit.   If mobs are getting shot from someone they can't get to, RUN OUT OF RANGE.  It's short enough... \n\nI can go on, but you get the point by now..  This game is very beautiful.. More over, the 1 to 20 game is awe inspiring, and should be a lesson to other games as to how a game should be made.  \n\nAt 21 though (or when you get off the island) the polish comes crashing down.  It's sad really.  I know for a fact it's driving players away.  Several of my friends have already left due to these annoying bugs.. Above are just the ones that the ranger suffers.. each class has their own set just like this.. \n\nI do like the new combat system, but it isn't enough to support a game.  You need to get the rest of this crap working.. \n\nIn six or eight months this game will likely be awesome.. but for now it's annoying and upsets me.  Time will tell, but I dunno if I will stick it out.\n\n \n\n \n","collection":"posts","url":"/age-of-conan-annoys-me/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2008-06-17-super-heroes-is-st00pid.md","collection":"posts","url":"/super-heroes-is-st00pid/","path":"_posts/2008-06-17-super-heroes-is-st00pid.md","id":"/super-heroes-is-st00pid","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Super Heroes is st00pid","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2008/06/cohgamebox.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-06-17 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"super-heroes-is-st00pid","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2008-06-15-age-of-conan-annoys-me.md","excerpt":"I'm starting to get upset / annoyed with Age of Conan.  Probably it's more fair to say, disappointed -- but you can only scream at your monitor for so long before disappointment spirals down into something else. ","id":"/age-of-conan-annoys-me","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Age of Conan is beginning to annoy me","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2008/06/age_of_conan_cover.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-06-15 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"age-of-conan-annoys-me","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2008-06-14-assassins-creed.md","excerpt":"Another console to PC port that's been out since April, Assassins Creed is a third person sneaker created by Ubisoft in which the player repeatedly delves into his genetic memory in order to assume the role of a 12th century assassin...","id":"/assassins-creed","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Assassins Creed","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2008/06/256px-assassins_creed.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-06-14 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"assassins-creed","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2008-06-13-mass-effect.md","excerpt":"This game looked awesome!
