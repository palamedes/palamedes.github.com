Instead of pushing a single button, maybe sense that we are actually pushing a cord or even a single string..   And once you get to the end of the difficulty curve you're playing the song..   How awesome would that be?!\n\nSuddenly not only would Rock Band be a kick ass game, but it would also be a must have teacher that could train you to play your favorite songs (for only $2 a download.. or whatever it is..)..\n\nOnce you have a device that hooks into a guitar or drums it should be fairly simple to make that device work for other instruments..\n\nImagine if you will, \"Piano Hero!\"  or maybe \"Violin Hero!\"   It would allow you to play a game with you instrument of choice, and go a long way towards teaching you to better play that instrument..\n\nYou think \"Band Hero\" is fun?  Try \"Symphony Hero!\" hah\n\nThere are so many possibilities here.. I seriously hope that they don't squander this..  They could spark a whole new revolution around music making if they really wanted to..\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2010-04-08-the-sonic-infusion.md","url":"/the-sonic-infusion/","relative_path":"_posts/2010-04-08-the-sonic-infusion.md","id":"/the-sonic-infusion","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"The Sonic Infusion","layout":"post","tags":["Media"],"image":"/images/2010/04/si-150x150.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":true,"allow_comments":false,"date":"2010-04-08 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"the-sonic-infusion","ext":".md"},"url":"/rock-band-to-real-band/","relative_path":"_posts/2010-04-09-rock-band-to-real-band.md","id":"/rock-band-to-real-band","collection":"posts","excerpt":"I have been playing the hell out of Rock Band 2.  I very much enjoy it as it's quite fun and challenging. ","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"From Rock Band to Real Band","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2010/04/rock-band-guitar-decal-150x150.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2010-04-09 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"rock-band-to-real-band","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2010-04-08-the-sonic-infusion.md","output":null,"content":"<img title=\"si\" src=\"/images/2010/04/si-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" class='pull-right' />\n\nMy music tastes range far and wide, but when it comes to some tunes to play in the background while working I find that good techno, house, or trance serve me the best.  I can really get into a groove when listening to this music..  Oddly enough it helps me focus on my work and blocks out the distractions nicely..   My productivity probably triples when I can code to the beats..\n\nTypically I would listen to some Classic or Vocal Trance on <a href=\"http://www.di.fm\" target=\"_blank\">DI.FM</a> (Digitally Imported Radio) a service I happily pay for because it did such a good job of keeping me focused on my work.  A while back I stumbled across the Sonic Infusion while browsing the podcasts available on iTunes and I've been hooked..\n\nThe Sonic Infusion is a free podcast put out (about once a month) by Spencer Gordon consisting of skillfully mixed and current Progressive, House and Trance music from all over the world ranging in length from 1 to 3 hours..  And it's great!  At this point I have listened to all 120 episodes and he is only getting better..  What blows me away is that he does this for free..  He puts it out there solely to promote his and the other artists' work, and is completely worth the listen.  The quality is high enough that if he put CD's out there I bet people would buy them..\n\nI realize this post is a shameless plug, and as such not something I typically do..

It's like crack.. They put subliminal messages in the video's to make you want to play it day and night!!\n\nThe best part is that my wife has been playing it too.. And even more surprising is she likes playing drums!!   That actually came as a shock to me.. I expected her to enjoy guitar or bass.. I never thought she'd like the drums because frankly they are the hardest part..\n\nBut she loves it so we play together and do fairly well..Good times!!\n\nNow they just need to add a lot more Journey songs.. They only have 2?!  TWO!!!  *sigh*  More!  I want more damnit.. hehe\n\nGood game.. I highly recommend it..\n","previous":{"next":{"path":"_posts/2010-04-05-cant-talk-playing-rock-band.md","url":"/cant-talk-playing-rock-band/","relative_path":"_posts/2010-04-05-cant-talk-playing-rock-band.md","id":"/cant-talk-playing-rock-band","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Can't talk... playing Rock Band!","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2010/04/rock_band_2_callout-150x150.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2010-04-05 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"cant-talk-playing-rock-band","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2010-03-15-8mm-mauser-reloading.md","output":null,"content":"<img title=\"Reloading Press\" src=\"/images/2010/03/reloadpress-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" class='pull-right' />\n\nI really enjoy shooting..  I always have..  In the military I would go to the range every weekend and throw some rounds down range just for the pure joy of it..  And while I would sometimes shoot my pistols, I prefer rifles..  I dunno what it is, but there is something very peaceful about the focus and presence of mind you need to effectively shoot a rifle..\n\nI liked it because when shooting, all the cares of the day seemed to kinda slip away..  You had to focus on what you're doing and not be distracted by anything in order to hit your target, especially at range..  I have missed it..\n\nThe main reason I have missed it was due to cost, and distance..  Simply put there aren't any ranges near where I live, and since my primary round is 7.92x57mm Mauser it can get a tad pricey..  Enter reloading..\n\nI have wanted to get back into shooting something fearce and have been trolling several shooter forums trying to find a new inexpensive round that I can shoot that would afford me the accuracy I require in a cost effective manner..   A lot of people have suggested .223, .308 or even 6br.. But that would require a whole new rifle, not exactly a cheap solution..\n\nSo instead, I have started to reload my old used 8mm brass..  It's so easy too!!  I have to admit I'm shocked at the simplicity of the process.. Plus the saves are about 50% a round..\n\nPreviously the el'cheapo stock ammo purchased off the intertubes went for about $1 a round or as much as $2.50 a round at the range -- reloading my old brass comes in at $0.53 a round.. Yay!!    And the nice thing is I don't have to buy a new rifle..\n\nHaving said that I would love to get a new rifle..hehe  For now I'm going to just keep reloading the 8mm stuff and shoot the guns I have, but I still like the idea of getting something else.. Plus I spent a good deal of time pouring over the <a href=\"http://savagearms.com\" target=\"_blank\">Savage Arms</a> website, and I must admit some of those guns made me drool a little..\n\nBut they are a tad pricey..  Plus I'm back to facing the chambering issue.. what should I get?  I'm sort of leaning towards a bench rest gun since the range I go to doesn't allow for freestanding or prone shooting.. (They say its for insurance reasons..)\n\nMy friends suggest .223 and .308 because they are common rounds.. Of the two I'd be more likely to go .308 over .223 because its a traditional round that can be used for anything where as the .223 is more of a varmant round..  But the 6br (.243 basically) has a lot going for it too.. I dunno..\n\nRight now it's a moot point because of cost..  A good rifle to fire any of those rounds would cost $1500 new.. And that's only half the cost.. without good optics you might as well be throwing rocks..   It's insane how much a good scope can run you..\n\nOh well.. I'll keep reloading my mauser and dream..\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2010-03-08-ubisoft-and-their-drm.md","url":"/ubisoft-and-their-drm/","relative_path":"_posts/2010-03-08-ubisoft-and-their-drm.md","id":"/ubisoft-and-their-drm","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Games","Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Ubisoft and their DRM","layout":"post","tags":["Ubisoft","DRM"],"image":"/images/2010/03/drm.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2010-03-08 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"ubisoft-and-their-drm","ext":".md"},"url":"/8mm-mauser-reloading/","relative_path":"_posts/2010-03-15-8mm-mauser-reloading.md","id":"/8mm-mauser-reloading","collection":"posts","excerpt":"I really enjoy shooting..  I always have..  In the military I would go to the range every weekend and throw some rounds down range just for the pure joy of it..  And while I would sometimes shoot my pistols, I prefer rifles.. ","draft":false,"categories":["Hobbies"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"8mm Mauser Reloading","layout":"post","tags":["Shooting","Reloading"],"image":"/images/2010/03/reloadpress-150x150.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2010-03-15 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"8mm-mauser-reloading","ext":".md"},"url":"/cant-talk-playing-rock-band/","relative_path":"_posts/2010-04-05-cant-talk-playing-rock-band.md","id":"/cant-talk-playing-rock-band","collection":"posts","excerpt":"So I haven't updated my blog in a while because all my spare time has been spent playing Rockband 2..
