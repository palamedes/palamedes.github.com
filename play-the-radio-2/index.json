You wont be saving money, instead you'll be giving your money to these unscrupulous companies who are doing their best through fear to drive the price as high as it can go before it crashes.  And it will crash.  Let me explain why;\n\nSee.. Gold is a commodity and a standard.  As such, it's value never really changes.  What changes is the dollars value in relation to the gold.. So when you see golds value go up, what you're actually seeing is the dollar go down.  When you have say 10 ounces of gold worth $3000, and suddenly that prices shoots to $10000 what you're actually seeing is the value of the dollar shoot down.  10 ounces of gold is still just 10 ounces of gold.\n\nWhen the dollar strengthens again (as it always does) you'll see the price of gold go back down to something more reasonable.  This is why I say gold WILL crash..  that means that the folks who purchased gold at $1120 an ounce will take it on the chin..\n\nI'm not saying that you should never buy gold.. Actually I think gold can be a good thing to buy, but only when the dollar is very strong (and thus the price of gold is lower).\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2010-01-04-star-trek-online.md","url":"/star-trek-online/","relative_path":"_posts/2010-01-04-star-trek-online.md","id":"/star-trek-online","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Star Trek Online please don't be another Champions Online","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2010/01/sto.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2010-01-04 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"star-trek-online","ext":".md"},"url":"/buy-gold-just-not-right-now/","relative_path":"_posts/2010-01-05-buy-gold-just-not-right-now.md","id":"/buy-gold-just-not-right-now","collection":"posts","excerpt":"So there are a lot of people, some famous, trying to get you to buy gold..  While I was in the car dealership the other day in the waiting area they had the TV playing and there was something like 10 different gold resellers trying to convince us that NOW is the time to buy gold..","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Buy gold!!!

Well I'm a better Warlock than you are.. and I'll prove it!!\"  etc..\n\nPlayers end up putting a lot of time and effort in to trying to make their cookie cutter class stand out from all the other cookie cutter classes.  That in and of itself forces a person to form a bond or an identity with their character making them want to keep playing..\n\nWhen you can start your characters virtual life as being 100% unique, you have one less thing to strive for..  So while it's really cool I can go out of my way to make my character look completely different.. it doesn't lend itself to longevity..\n\nThis also completely ruins the whole sense of community around a given class which is a problem.. What's more community is completely thrashed by the total lack of classes where group play happens..  The open architecture of characters, while initially cool, makes group forming painful because suddenly you can't say \"We need a healer\" and know that there are only 3 or 4 basic classes that heal..\n\nSTO appears to have classes with regards to ships; tanks, dps, and support ships.  So that's a damn good sign.  I'm hoping the realize the issues I described above and are working to correct the issue.. But I still have fears about the game as a whole..\n\nFor example; I absolutely cringe at the notion of wandering around a space station and having random NPC's run up and yell about how awesome I am like they did in CoH/CoV and CO..  Please rip that page out of the CoH/CoV/CO hand book and burn it..\n\nI also worry that the game's look (read: graphics) are dated even before the game has been released.  Cryptic has always intentionally made their games sort of \"middle of the road\" with regards to hardware requirements so it's very likely that the game will not be super high quality, but even so they screen shots look very lack-luster.   These could all be beta shots with poor textures or something, but I doubt it.\n\nI'm the first to admit that gameplay comes over graphics every time though, so if the game play is good then I can forgive just about any graphics decisions.. But then they aren't known for their game play so its easy to jump to conclusions..\n\nI guess my greatest fear is that Star Trek Online will end up being \"City of Star Trek\" and will be to Star Trek, what the original Star Wars MMO was to Star Wars.

Sorta..\n\nI don't want to claim the label burning idea as my own, but I have to admit I had the same idea several times after many an hour of trying to get some form of \"pretty\" label into my CD's without completely throwing them out of balance..   And I am opt'ing to review the technology as a whole, not an individual burner..  They will all work about the same..\n\nSo, with that I have to say the burner itself is excellent.. I have had zero dead discs (discs that just fail for no reason during the burn process) and it is pretty darn fast at burning the disk data..  My old burner would have dead discs all the time and was slow as hell by comparison..  This is likely just due to the new 16x burner being a generation (or two?) newer than my old one..\n\nSo.. the long and short of it is, when it comes to burning your data -- it works just fine.  But that's not the real reason I purchased it.. I want a device that can burn labels so that I don't have to use stickers, a special printer or even (god forbid) a sharpie..\n\nStickers tend to throw the disc out of balance which at modern high drive speeds can be a bad thing.. Special printers can be pricey (though the new ones that print right on the disc do a nice job) and the require inks, and in some cases label stickers..  And if I have to resort to a sharpie no one will know what is on the darn disc cause my hand writing is horrible..\n\nSo this is where the technology is supposed to really shine and it does to a point but I have some complaints..\n\nFirstly, let me say it's awesome being able to photoshop up some labels and just burn them to the disc..  The Lightscribe folks have even put together a software package that allows you to cobble together labels from preexisting templates, with lots and lots of other templates downloadable off their website..\n\nThat's nice..\n\nBut (complaint #1) it's ungodly slow..  It takes something like 6 minutes to burn an ISO with this 16x burner? I don't know the exact time but it's pretty darn fast.. It then takes about 35 minutes to burn the label..  Why does it take so long?\n\nThat wouldn't be too bad if it weren't for the fact that (complaint #2) the label is extremely light or faded and hard to read.  Folks on one forum I browsed were joking that we have to wait for the \"DarkScribe\" burner to come out before the labels will be easy to read..  Frankly the contrast ratio is extremely poor..  For the amount of time it took, it should produce a much sharper image than it does.. Apparently this is something new to the 16x discs and the old 8x discs didn't do this..\n\nAlso, I haven't tested this yet but I'm told all you have to do is burn the label multiple times in order for it to be easier to read.. that means though that you have to suffer that 35 minute label burn several times.. Bleh..  Apparently around the center of each disc there is a barcode that allows the drive to know the precise rotational position of the disc, enabling multiple burns..\n\nAnd finally, (complaint #3) apparently you have to take special storage precautions with the discs or else the labels will fade..  Seriously?!\n\nI don't know how bad the fading can get as the labels seem somewhat faded right out of the burner..  I think any amount of fading would render the label unreadable in fairly short order..\n\nSo.. there you have it.. I love the technology but the fact that it's Slow as hell, Faded unless burned multiple times, and Can fade further seems like some pretty stiff drawbacks..\n\nSuddenly the printer that can print directly on the disc, in color no less, seems like a better option..   (Yeah lightscribe can't do color)..  One thing I was surprised by was the cost of the media..  Lightscribe discs used to be a lot more expensive than regular CD/DVD's.. that isn't the case any longer.. So yay for that..\n\nAll in all I'm happy with the purchase and would recommend the burner, but you have to understand that you will need to burn the label a couple times to get a good looking label with any contrast to it..\n","previous":{"next":{"path":"_posts/2009-11-16-hardware-review-lightscribe-cddvd-burners.md","url":"/hardware-review-lightscribe-cddvd-burners/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-11-16-hardware-review-lightscribe-cddvd-burners.md","id":"/hardware-review-lightscribe-cddvd-burners","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Hardware Review: Lightscribe CD/DVD Burners","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2009/11/592px-CDLabelLightScribe_WikipediaLogo.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-11-16 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"hardware-review-lightscribe-cddvd-burners","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2009-11-15-games-workshop-warhammer-fantasy-the-new-skaven.md","output":null,"content":"<img class=\"pull-right\" title=\"Skaven\" src=\"/images/2009/11/skaven-head.jpg\" alt=\"Skaven\" width=\"270\" height=\"286\" />\n\nI have been a Skaven player since the early 1990's.  They were the second fantasy army I got into after Orcs &amp; Goblins.  Once I found the blessing of the horned rat however, my love of all things green didn't last very long..   The Skaven were here to stay!  I love these little guys.. Primarily because back then they were as damaging and deadly to themselves as they were to anyone else..\n\nLater revisions of the Skaven codex very much removed a good portion of the wild and whacky from the army entirely and they sort of became boring.. I stuck with them through all these years but eventually ventured into Tomb Kings just to try something new..  Well with the new Skaven, I'm back baby..\n\nAnd my opponents are doomed!\n\nOr, well I might be doomed.. It all depends on the dice I suppose..   Either way it promises to be fun!\n\nI really like where they are going with the army.. I mean I know the army is bound to be more powerful than the current armies are simply because it's the latest army..   That's just the way of things.. Games Workshop is a company in the business to make money and the way to do that is to make the lastest revision just a smidge better than previous ones so folks will flock to it.. But having said that, I like that they army is back to being quite self destructive..\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2009/11/doomwheel1.jpg\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"New Doomwheel\" src=\"/images/2009/11/doomwheel1-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"New Doomwheel\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>New Doomwheel</span></a>\n\nFirstly, they have added the doomwheel back to the roster.. Something they completely omitted from the last book entirely.. Not only did they bring it back in the new book but they released a new model for it and its great!\n\nI still have my old doomwheel model on the shelf where its sat for the last 10 years or so not getting played.. and when I read that the new book would have a doomwheel I blew off the dust getting it ready for play..  Then I saw the new model.. Holy crap.. Yeah okay.. back on the shelf you go.. I'm getting the new on and painting it.. (See image)\n\nPlus it's all plastic!  Yay!\n\nI remember the day when the metal models were all way more detailed than anything they could come up with in plastic, but those days are long gone.. Give me plastic all the way..  Well it appears GW has heard our pleas and is intending to release all new models for the Skaven..   They have already put out a number of them, with a few more in the wings to come out.\n\nPlus the codex has a bunch of new units that they will have to produce models for sooner or later so I expect even more..\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2009/11/stormvermin01.jpg\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Stormvermin Before and After\" src=\"/images/2009/11/stormvermin01-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Stormvermin Before and After\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Stormvermin Before and After</span></a>\n\nThe new stormvermin plastic kit is fantastic.. Gone are the days of having to purchase a buttload of individually packed blisters at$15 each just to have a 20 model unit.. The new stormvermin box comes with everything you need to have a fully functional unit of 20 models..\n\nThey paint up nicely and the dip method works perfectly on Skaven.  Click the before and after picture to see what I'm talking about.  That model was painted in about 15 minutes.. I did what I can only call a slap/dash job of painting him with basic colors and then performed the magical \"dip\" at which point he came out looking great.\n\nAdd to the mix the WAY over the top new characters and warmachines and you have one powerful army..  I look forward to building a force to play with..  The only down side is it looks like I will have to repurpose all my old models as they aren't what I would build now..  The up side is, I now have more slaves than I know what to do with..\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2009-11-14-game-review-dragon-age-origins.md","url":"/game-review-dragon-age-origins/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-11-14-game-review-dragon-age-origins.md","id":"/game-review-dragon-age-origins","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Game Review: Dragon Age - Origins","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2009/11/dragonageoriginslogo.png","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-11-14 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"game-review-dragon-age-origins","ext":".md"},"url":"/games-workshop-warhammer-fantasy-the-new-skaven/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-11-15-games-workshop-warhammer-fantasy-the-new-skaven.md","id":"/games-workshop-warhammer-fantasy-the-new-skaven","collection":"posts","excerpt":"I have been a Skaven player since the early 1990's.  They were the second fantasy army I got into after Orcs &amp; Goblins.  Once I found the blessing of the horned rat however, my love of all things green didn't last very long..   The Skaven were here to stay!","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Games Workshop -- Warhammer Fantasy: The new Skaven","layout":"post","tags":["Warhammer"],"image":"/images/2009/11/skaven-head.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-11-15 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"games-workshop-warhammer-fantasy-the-new-skaven","ext":".md"},"url":"/hardware-review-lightscribe-cddvd-burners/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-11-16-hardware-review-lightscribe-cddvd-burners.md","id":"/hardware-review-lightscribe-cddvd-burners","collection":"posts","excerpt":"Back in 2004 Hewlett-Packard engineer Daryl Anderson had the notion that if you can burn data on to a disc, why couldn't use use that same technology to burn the label?  And thus the LightScribe burner was born..","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Hardware Review: Lightscribe CD/DVD Burners","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2009/11/592px-CDLabelLightScribe_WikipediaLogo.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-11-16 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"hardware-review-lightscribe-cddvd-burners","ext":".md"},"url":"/play-the-radio-2/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-12-09-play-the-radio-2.md","id":"/play-the-radio-2","collection":"posts","excerpt":"So I had said previously that my musical talent ended pretty much at the ability to play the radio, and that I hated that..  I wrote that entry back in July of '08 and I still hate it..","draft":false,"categories":["Hobbies"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Play the radio 2","layout":"post","tags":["Music"],"image":"/images/2009/12/eviolin-150x150.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-12-09 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"play-the-radio-2","ext":".md"}
