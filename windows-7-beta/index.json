My intent is to learn the ins and out's of it for a project at work.  So far I like what I am seeing.\n\nI need to learn a \"best practices\" as there are many ways to do things in jQuery and I am very likely going about some of it incorrectly..  But, there is only one way to try things and that's to jump off the deep end!  So far it's cake..  Something I have wanted for my site for a while now was a lightbox implementation.  And while Wordpress has quite a few lightbox like plugins, I thought it would be interesting to create my own using jQuery such that ANY link (on any website) with an attribute of rel=\"lightbox\" would be opened as a lightbox.  This is the file I'm actively developing on;\n\n<pre id=\"line13\"><span class=\"attribute-value\">http://rsow.com/files/jquery.lightbox.js</span></pre>\n\nAnd the image above will be my lightbox test image for the time being.  Clicking the image will close the lightbox.\n\nSo far so good!  The lightbox appears to be working nicely.  Clicking the image correctly pulls the \"shade\" (the darker background) and opens a white background over the shade with a \"loading\" gif.  It then loads the image into memory.   Once the image is loaded, it then resizes the white background to the size of the image, and displays the image in the place of the loading image.\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2009/03/wideimage.jpg\" class='pull-right'><img title=\"wideimage\" src=\"/images/2009/03/wideimage-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Large Wide Image\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Large Wide Image</span></a>\n\nYou most likely wont ever see the loading GIF unless you're loading a very large image like the one to the left.  But that brought up a different problem.  What if the image is larger than the screen?\n\nThe lightbox will now automatically size the image to fit your screen upon load. If you resize your desktop while the lightbox is displaying it wont adjust itself yet.\n\nAt this point the only real pain is remembering to add rel=\"lightbox\" to your anchors.  I'm sure there is a way to get Wordpress to play nice with that regard.. not sure yet.  Also my goal was to make it so that the only thing you would need would be to add jQuery and my jQuery.lightbox files to your site and you're good to go. Unfortunately I forgot about the loading graphic.. so you'll want that gif too..  And it will need to live at /images/loading.gif   You can use any you like, so long as it's there and it isn't too large.\n\n<img title=\"Loading\" src=\"/images/loading.gif\" alt=\"Loading GIF\" width=\"48\" height=\"47\" class='pull-left' />\n\nFeel free to use mine..\n\nI want to add some more features to this thing.. I dunno how crazy I'll get though.  Comments would be nice on an image by image basis, but not sure how to go about that.  Either I can try to embed the comments in the page in some hidden way and then have jQuery pull them or I could try loading them from a similarily named file that resides next to the image?  I dunno.\n\nI also like the idea of creating other forms of pop-ups / lightbox styles through the use of the rel attribute.  If you use \"lightbox\" it does what it does now, but if you use \"lightbox_zoom\" (or something) it does something else..   I already have other ideas but I dunno how crazy I want to get.\n\nRight now this system has no way to do groups either.. this is purely a singleton solution right now.  I'd like to add more features but for now it's where its at.  I'm a little stunned at how easy it was to create to be honest.  This bodes very well for jQuery.\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2009-03-09-game-review-empire-total-war.md","url":"/game-review-empire-total-war/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-03-09-game-review-empire-total-war.md","id":"/game-review-empire-total-war","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Game Review: Empire: Total War","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2009/03/empire_christmas2007_1024x768-150x150.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-03-09 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"game-review-empire-total-war","ext":".md"},"url":"/jquery-lightbox/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-03-11-jquery-lightbox.md","id":"/jquery-lightbox","collection":"posts","excerpt":"I have been playing with the javascript library jQuery for a couple days now..

Either that or the reviewers didn't play the same game they published..\n\nI'm going to complain a bit now, but let me say that the game is good and I do like it.   It's major failing at this point is the vast number of bugs..\n\nSo, as good as it is now, it will be even better once they fix all the annoying bugs, and man are there ever a lot of them..  But the potential is so huge I can't wait.. I'm still playing the hell out of it and I do for the most part enjoy it, but the bugs detract from the game something awful.\n\nThere are quite a few memory leak style bugs where the game eventually will crash just due to repeated play or long term play.. Feh.. No big deal.   I completely understand this sort of thing and can forgive it.\n\nThe big issue is the horrible AI employed by the enemy.   The whole point of this game is to have combat in the form of 18th century gun lines where out maneuvering your opponent is as important as the shots fired..\n\nThe computer doesn't do any of that..  It just masses troops towards you in huge blocks of chaos..  Things like buildings and walls completely confuse the AI and a lot of the time they will just stand there stupidly while you blow them away.\n\nOr you will go out of your way to develop a clever tactic only to have the game ignore you completely and march all their troops in a straight line for no apparent reason..\n\nIt's almost impossible to lose a combat at this point just because the AI is retarded.. It's unfortunate, but true..\n\nFrankly, the AI is just appaulingly bad..  I know this stuff is hard, but it really shouldn't have been shipped in the state it is in.  I don't blame the developer for this, this is yet another in a long line of games being pushed out the door before they were ready.  It really sucks that publishers are STILL doing this.\n\nLook, I understand that a game (any game) is lost revinue until the game is out the door, but releasing it before it's ready only hurts your bottom line.  It hurts your bottom line for years to come!  Releasing a game before its ready to be released pisses off the fan base making them not want to buy your next game.   It's extremely short sited to publish a game thinking that you'll fix it in a patch.  You guys need to stop doing it!\n\nSo.. all in all, the game is good.. I give it a strong 4 out of 5..  What keeps it from being a 5 out of 5 is the horrible AI.  That's the only thing..  There are other issues that folks complain about, like the lack of unique uniforms or some little nitpicky details about the animations.. feh.. I can look past that entirely..  The AI is hard to get past..\n\nLets hope they stay true to their model and support the game for a while.. If they patch the AI a bit, the game will be worth every bit of that 94..\n","previous":{"next":{"path":"_posts/2009-03-09-game-review-empire-total-war.md","url":"/game-review-empire-total-war/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-03-09-game-review-empire-total-war.md","id":"/game-review-empire-total-war","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Game Review: Empire: Total War","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2009/03/empire_christmas2007_1024x768-150x150.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-03-09 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"game-review-empire-total-war","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2009-02-05-windows-7-beta.md","output":null,"content":"<img title=\"Windows 7\" src=\"/images/2009/02/vista_7_1-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Windows 7\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" class='pull-right' />\n\nI'm generally slow to change operating systems..  When it comes to making one of those sweeping changes, traditionally I was the equivalent of an old man on his porch yelling for \"you kids to get off my lawn!\"   I was a curmudgeon and quite often would refuse to budge.\n\nI didn't switch to Windows 95 until sometime in 97..

So I was extremely excited about Dawn of War, though for whatever reason I didn't get to play it much.\n\nDoW looked very good and I wanted to make sure that I played DoW2!    I wasn't about to let more Warhammer goodness slip by!\n\nDoW2 made by Relic studios uses the same engine that Company of Heroes uses and looks fantastic.   More over, so long as you never actually try to play other people you'll have a great time!    The game is designed to be very fast paced and they have removed the \"build\" element from the game entirely.\n\nIt's pretty clear to me that they have geared this game towards the 16 to 20 year old Korean kids or people with a severe case of ADD as the game plays at a pretty much frantic pace.   Not my style, but I can see why it would be fun.\n\nMore over, I bet if I were actually able to play it multiplayer it would be a cool game..   Oh but I can't.\n\nWhy you ask?\n\nSimple really.. Relic uses the same craptacular network code that Company of Heroes used back in 2006, and as such a good 50% of the game owners out there, can't play it online.  The game always complains of a \"NAT ERROR\".\n\nI can (and do) play other multiplayer games all the time.  I can play GRID, Call of Duty, Battlefield 2142, Left 4 Dead, TFC2..etc.. all multiplayer, all online over the internet and all work just fine.   Yet DoW2 (and Company of Heroes) all say my network is bad.   And I have tried everything right down to plugging my system directly into the modem which generally I think is a bad idea..\n\nMore over, the relic forums have a LOT of folks complaining about this issue.  Since this exact same error has been in effect since CoH was released in 2006.. It's pretty apparent that Relic doesn't give a crap..  And as such, I will not buy this game, and would further ask others to not buy this game.\n\nIf the game developers can refuse to fix a problem that has been plaguing their games for a while (and blame the users instead of their code or code decsisions for the problem), then why should I or any one else buy their game?     You don't reward the dog and say \"good boy\" when he craps on the carpet..  Paying money for something we can't use effectively rewards them for making something that doesn't work.\n\nI wont be buying this game.  The game play gets a 2 1/2 out of 5.. the speed RTS isn't my style but I can see what some would like it, however the removal of the build element completely turns the game into a zerg fest designed to compete with star craft 2 which I don't find fun at all..\n\nThe network thing drags the score down to a 1.  Fix your shit Relic.\n","previous":{"next":{"path":"_posts/2009-02-01-game-review-dawn-of-war-2.md","url":"/game-review-dawn-of-war-2/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-02-01-game-review-dawn-of-war-2.md","id":"/game-review-dawn-of-war-2","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Game Review: Dawn of War 2","layout":"post","tags":["Warhammer","Review"],"image":"/images/2009/02/dawn-of-war-2-1642-150x150.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-02-01 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"game-review-dawn-of-war-2","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2009-01-30-wow134fix.md","output":null,"content":"It's fixed!  The dreaded #134 Error is no more!   And for the most part the Blizzard tech support people are completely worthless.. But I get ahead of myself.\n\n__Firstly, what it's not;__\n\nThe blizzard folks over at their forums, as well as those you get ahold of on the phone.. and via email will try to blame everything on you.  The reason for this will come clear shortly, but in a way they are right and in a way wrong.\n\nThe World of Warcraft #134 error is so vague and broad in scope that it is the support equivalent to, \"It broke!\"...  It could be any number of things, but the thing they just about always tell you it is, is memory.  Read the forums and you'll always see some asshat chiming in that it must be your memory..  The issue I had with that response is that I had run tests against my 4 gigs of memory both in linux, and in windows using multiple tools as well as testing each stick individually..  My memory was flawless every time.. even using the test blizzard suggested I use.\n\nOnce I proved that, they suddenly tried to blame some other facet of my hardware..  Long story short, everything they suggested WAS WRONG.  Period..\n\nSo I got to looking into why they always insisted it was memory.. And how the MPQ files which should be read-only archives of data were getting corrupted.    Why the hell was blizzard writing back to those files..\n\n(Note: most of this is what I have gleaned while looking into it as well as relying on my own and coworkers programming knowledge.. it's not 100% for sure, but an edjumikated guess.)\n\nThe MPQ files that WoW uses contain all the various objects, models, textures and what nots that the game needs to play.   The majority of those things are textures that the system needs to constantly load to display..  The problem is the MPQ's are many gigs in size, and as of yet no graphics card has that much on board memory..  Nor do most systems have enough space to load the entire game into memory..  To get around this blizzard employed a technique called memory mapping.\n\nWithout going into too much detail, the addresses for the chunks of the data it needs is mapped directly to the hard drive and stuffed into the graphics card memory.. (Or more likely into main memory, then replicated into the graphics card memory.. but thats not important.)  These functions are controlled by windows entirely and out of the games control.  That's why there is writing going on.  For the most part they use this technique to speed things up other wise your computers hard drive and bus would be completely hammered trying to shuffle all the textures around.. And WoW is nothing if not texture packed..\n\nAny time anything changes in memory, it writes those changes directly back to the file -- this is simply due to the nature of memory mapping in windows..  (playing WoW in Linux will not have this problem, it will have a completely different problem if the ultimate issue is the same)\n\nIf there are no changes, then nothing gets written back -- this is what's supposed to happen as blizzard knows (or assumes) that the textures wont get changed.  But lets say something did change and blizzard knows that their client didn't make that change..  The only thing that could have happened was something broke.\n\nThis is the reason blizzard naturally tells you that your memory is bad, and often why they say virus scanners could play a part too, or even a hard drive..  If the memory went bad then a couple bits would change forcing windows to write back to the MPQ corrupting it.. Or if there is bad sectors on the hard drive where the pagefile is, same problem.. etc..\n\n__What it actually was;__\n\nWhat they fail to tell you about is.. what if the memory on your graphics card is bad?  That's much harder to test..\n\nMy problem ended up being a bug with the EVGA built nVidia 8800GTX graphics card.  Apparently the fan on the graphics card wouldn't correctly auto-increase in speed which meant my graphics card over heated at some point.. (You can download the <a href=\"http://www.evga.com/precision/\" target=\"_blank\">EVGA Precision tool</a> to fix this manually)  Which ultimately meant the memory on my graphics card started to corrupt.. It only got worse as time went on because the heat problem continued to be an issue, eventually causing the card to die completely.\n\nThe 8800GTX was a great card and it worked for me flawlessly for 2 years before this issue showed up so I can't complain about it at all.. The main issue with it was it routinely operated around 80 degrees Celsius..   With an operational ceiling of 105... that's pretty slim margins and almost begs to overheat..\n\nBut, In a weird way, the blizzard folks were right;  it was a memory issue.  Just not in the way they were insisting it was..   What they didn't realize and probably still don't realize was that it wasn't system memory that was causing the corruption.   More over, none of the tests they suggest would have ever revealed any of those issues.\n\nFrom my perspective, my system was working flawlessly because unless a software package actually tried to use any of the faulty memory on the graphics card, everything appeared to work perfectly.    I still have the 8800gtx card and can plug it into a system right now and so long as you don't try to play a game on it, it works perfectly in windows and linux.\n\nFor me the fix meant I had to replace my graphics card.. I pop'ed the 8800gtx out and installed a <a href=\"http://www.nvidia.com/object/buy_now_results.html?id=GTX285\" target=\"_blank\">nVidia GTX 285</a> and everything works peachy..  My system is back up and happy and so am I.  For a while there I was dreading playing the game because I knew it would crash any second..\n\nMy new card under full load operates at 51ºc (thirty degrees cooler than the 8800 at idle) and all is well...\n\nThe thing I really take out of this is how poorly I was treated by the blizzard support folks.  I'm actually aghast at how bad their support is.  Not because they couldn't come up with a fix, this was a tough one.. but because they were so nonchalant about it and didn't seem to remotely care.\n\nAfter all, I'm just one of eleven million subscribers.. who gives a crap if I'm happy right?\n\nIf you're having #134's, check to make sure your system isn't over heating..  Run the various memory testers, but keep in mind that you have memory on your graphics card that as far as I know, you can't test and it could be the culprit.  If you have tried everything else, try swapping in a new graphics card..\n\nGood luck.\n\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2009-01-18-malygos.md","url":"/malygos/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-01-18-malygos.md","id":"/malygos","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"25man Malygos","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2009/01/lichking_2-150x150.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-01-18 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"malygos","ext":".md"},"url":"/wow134fix/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-01-30-wow134fix.md","id":"/wow134fix","collection":"posts","excerpt":"It's fixed!  The dreaded 134 Error is no more!   And for the most part the Blizzard tech support people are completely worthless..
