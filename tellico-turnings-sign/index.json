More than anything I'm learning about Ruby and programming in the Ruby on rails environment. I'm sure once all is said and done all have a decent product to share with the world, but it still just too early to release. (Even though you can actually get it online right now it might github account -- I would avoid doing so for the time being.)\n\nI've actually made a couple posts on my new blogging system, and those will become available once my blogging system goes live but I haven't bothered import them into WordPress yet and probably won't.\n\nMelissa and I are still very much wanting to move out of Texas and go to someplace like Tennessee or Georgia. We've been doing a lot of research and have some areas in mind; right now were looking at Blue Ridge Georgia. It's a very beautiful area with a lot of resort like cabins and whatnot and I honestly can't wait to live there. However, we have to wait for David weekly to get off their ass and actually correct what's wrong with our house --  We are still fighting that seven-year long fight with them regarding our foundation issues. It's an endless battle and to be honest I'm really tired of it -- I just want it all to go away.\n\nBut towards that end, we started cleaning up the house and started moving things out that we don't want here when we do show the house.  Here soon I will contact a couple different realtors and have them come out and tell us what we need to do in order to proceed. here today or tomorrow, I'm going to get a storage unit so that the decrapification of the house may continue.\n\nI'm trying to think of what else is going on.\n\nI'm starting to get that really weird foot pain again. I have those orthotics that the doctor gave me but to be honest those damn things hurt me more then not wearing them. I think ultimately I just need some new shoes, my tennis shoes are really rather old at this point.\n\nSome friends and I are looking at creating our own little video/audio blogging podcast around the programming we do in projects that we want to participate in. More than anything it's going to be four guys talking to one another just, fucking around but it's going be a lot of fun. I doubt anyone will seriously watch it, more than anything is just a fun way for us to keep in touch and goof off. But to that end I went ahead and purchased a really nice podcasting microphone. I have it hooked up on a boom mic stand and everything so that it sticks right in front of my mouth and can easily be pushed out of the way when I don't need it.\n\nSo for grins I went ahead and got a copy of Dragon natural speaking so that I can do some dictation. I figure that if I'm going to get this really nice microphone and get it set up to do this podcasting thing I might as well kill two birds with one stone and get the dictation software that I've always wanted to try so that I can give it a whack.\n\nI have to admit I'm really rather impressed; Dragon NaturallySpeaking is really fucking cool. Everything you see in this post was actually dictated directly from word-of-mouth to the WordPress text box with very little editing done post process. (it just wouldn't recognize \"decrapification\" since it's not a real word and I'm still trying to figure out how to train that word in.. heh)\n\nI knew that there was a lot of really good dictation software out there but I had no concept that it was this good.\n\nThe other nice thing about this dictation solution is that it will likely encourage me to create more posts and updates.\n\nAnyway that's all for now I'll try to be better about updating sorry took so long -- not that anyone actually reads this.. I have to admit this stuff is more for me than anyone else.\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2012-03-26-rubypress-wordpress-replacement.md","url":"/rubypress-wordpress-replacement/","relative_path":"_posts/2012-03-26-rubypress-wordpress-replacement.md","id":"/rubypress-wordpress-replacement","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Software Development"],"layout":"post","title":"RubyPress Wordpress Replacement","tags":["Ruby","Ruby on Rails","WordPress"],"published":true,"type":"post","image":"/images/2012/03/rubypress01-150x150.jpg","gallery":null,"ribbon":"ruby","allow_comments":true,"private":false,"date":"2012-03-26 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"rubypress-wordpress-replacement","ext":".md"},"url":"/wow-its-really-been-a-while/","relative_path":"_posts/2012-11-05-wow-its-really-been-a-while.md","id":"/wow-its-really-been-a-while","collection":"posts","excerpt":"Hey guys, I'm went dark for quite some time apparently and I didn't really mean to let this much time passed since my last post..","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"layout":"post","title":"wow it's really been a while","tags":[],"published":true,"type":"post","image":"/images/2013/01/beenawhile.jpg","gallery":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2012-11-05 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"wow-its-really-been-a-while","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2012-03-26-rubypress-wordpress-replacement.md","output":null,"content":"<a href=\"/images/2012/03/rubypress01.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"RubyPress\" src=\"/images/2012/03/rubypress01-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"RubyPress\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>RubyPress</span></a>\n\nSo a while back I had thought my WordPress install was getting exploited through some bug and decided I wanted to write my own replacement.. Turns out that bug had nothing to do with WordPress but was rather an issue with my host.. It's been resolved, but that niggling desire to [create my own blogging software](/my-own-custom-blogging-software/ \"My own custom blogging software\") stuck..\n\nThis is something I wanted to create from the ground up that would be a 100% \"my own\" solution to include even the look&amp;feel theme of the thing and I decided that it would also be 100% open source from the start.\n\nI wanted to use this project as a possible way to expand my horizons but I also wanted something functional that I could use and expand on quickly;  the more I thought (and still think) about this the sooner I wanted off WordPress, not because WordPress is a bad thing (it's not) but because I wanted something that was fully mine that I could modify to my heart's content.\n\nSo with that, I moved forward with my project and started looking at which language I wanted to write it in.   After some consideration I decided to limit myself to writing the code in Python, Ruby, Node, or PHP.\n\nI knew from the get-go that I didn't really want to write this thing in PHP.   PHP is a great language but it's getting a little long in the tooth and frankly some of the frameworks out there leave a lot to be desired.   Plus I have been writing PHP since '96 or so.. I'm ready to move on..\n\n<a href=\"/images/2012/03/rubypress02.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"RubyPress Admin\" src=\"/images/2012/03/rubypress02-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"RubyPress Admin\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>RubyPress Admin</span></a>\n\nSo with my original intent in mind I decided to branch out and try NodeJS as I really like JavaScript and I think node is fairly clever.  I played with node for a couple of weeks even making an initial start on the blogging software and while I do believe Node is pretty cool, I just don't think it's \"quite there\" yet.  I think node has a little bit of growing to do before it's fully matured, which isn't to take away from it at all but rather just my opinion on its current state.  For whatever reason, node didn't excite me.\n\nThis left me in a bit of a pickle;  Suddenly my language options went to Python, Ruby or back to PHP.   At the time I knew nothing about Python or Ruby compared to my PHP knowledge.\n\nI had to do some serious considering here and what I ultimately came back to was one simple fact;  PHP and the myriad of MVC frameworks I've worked with (Zend, Kohana, Cake, Symfony etc...) as well as Python and it's MVC frameworks (Django's really the only one I have any experience with) all do their damnedest to do what Rails is doing.\n\nRails does all the big stuff right out of the box and then you have the whole Gem library thing... dear god.. RoR seems awesome.. okay lets give that a try!  I've never so much as cracked a book on Ruby before so this will be a 100% new thing for me.. *shrug* why not?!  Off to the races I went.\n\nSide note:  I found that [Lynda.com](http://www.lynda.com/) has some nice beginner intro courses on Ruby and Rails and of course Ryan Bates at [Railscasts.com](http://railscasts.com/) has lots of good video information for the watching.. both are totally worth checking out..\n\nNow set the \"not so\" way-forward machine to 10 days later:    I've been working on it for 10 days or so, on and off, and in that amount of time I have created a system that allows me to import content directly from WordPress and display it on the site as seen in the screenshot above using my new theme.    I can create users, posts, pages, messages, have a functional (if sparse yet) admin area that forces authentication etc..  and they all work!\n\nSo, in 10 days using a language and framework I don't know and have never used before,  using plugins and modules I don't know and have never used before, even a brand new IDE..  etc..  I have managed to implement the core functionality of WordPress..    Holy crap, Ruby and Rails are easy as hell..   Seriously this stuff writes itself..  (I'm using [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) and [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) which I think are both brilliant and likely will be using CanCan and a few other gems as I need them. )\n\nI'm jokingly calling this project \"RubyPress\", more as a codename than a real product name since it's now become a Ruby blogging software to replace WordPress..\n\nI have no idea if it will grow beyond my getting the basic blogging functionality working.. I still have a lot of stuff that are requirements like categories, tags, theme support..etc..  Lots and lots to do.. but I'm really enjoying it, and learning Rails at the same time.. so win win..   There is still a lot of \"magic\" to Ruby for me, stuff that I'm not sure how or why it works the way it does..etc.. but slowly I'm getting it..  I'm sure this thing will require a dozen rewrites before it's not embarrassing.. heh  What can I say.. I'm a Ruby and Rails noob.. bear with me..\n\nThough I have to admin, it's coming together so quickly that I do entertain the notion of having something that might one day actually compete with WordPress.. WordPress itself has been around since 2003 and has a lot of very cool functionality that I doubt I'll ever match in my little toy project, but wouldn't it be fun?  =D\n\nIt is 100% open source; [https://github.com/palamedes/Press](https://github.com/palamedes/Press)\n\nI will keep working on it and eventually have something worth using I hope..  For now I'm still on WordPress..\n","previous":{"next":{"path":"_posts/2012-03-26-rubypress-wordpress-replacement.md","url":"/rubypress-wordpress-replacement/","relative_path":"_posts/2012-03-26-rubypress-wordpress-replacement.md","id":"/rubypress-wordpress-replacement","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Software Development"],"layout":"post","title":"RubyPress Wordpress Replacement","tags":["Ruby","Ruby on Rails","WordPress"],"published":true,"type":"post","image":"/images/2012/03/rubypress01-150x150.jpg","gallery":null,"ribbon":"ruby","allow_comments":true,"private":false,"date":"2012-03-26 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"rubypress-wordpress-replacement","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2012-03-02-tellico-turnings-sign.md","output":null,"content":"<a href=\"/images/2012/03/signone.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Tellico Turnings Sign\" src=\"/images/2012/03/signone-e1330746540276-150x102.jpg\" alt=\"Tellico Turnings Sign\" width=\"150\" height=\"102\" /><br /><span>Tellico Turnings Sign</span></a>\n\nSo while in [Tennessee with my father](/dads-new-store/ \"My latest trip to TN and Dads new store\"), I told him I'd make him some signs for his shop.   This was the first time I had ever attempted to do something like this and it took me the better part of 4 days working a couple hours a night to get one done.\n\n<a href=\"/images/2012/03/signtemplate.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"Sign Template\" src=\"/images/2012/03/signtemplate-e1330746875648-150x89.jpg\" alt=\"Sign Template\" width=\"150\" height=\"89\" /><br /><span>Sign Template</span></a>\n\nI created a template in photoshop that I thought would look nice based on discussions I had with dad while up there with intent of creating a sign wider than it was tall that would hang over the door of the shop.\n\nThe sign would be made up of three 1/4\" thick plywood panels.  Each outer panel would have the lettering cut out via the scroll saw and the inner panel would be stained dark and then sandwiched between the outers in order to give the final appearance.\n\nI made one side \"clean\" and professional looking (or rather as professional as I could with my meager skills), and one side more of an \"art\" look to it where I intentionally over sanded some of it just to get a unique look.  The edges are routed and rounded over and the sign as a whole is sanded smooth.\n\nI don't know if I like the \"art\" side..

(Leave the designing to the designers I guess.. Its good to know what I'm not good at..heh)\n\n<a href=\"/images/2012/02/shop01.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"Tellico Turnings 02\" src=\"/images/2012/02/shop01-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Tellico Turnings\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>The pens and calls table</span></a>\n\nHe has just the right amount of space with the right number of items out presented in an organized and uncluttered way that I think really does a good job of showing off the various pieces.\n\nThe market is open Friday, Saturday and Sunday each week from roughly 9am to 6pm each day except Sunday which I believe was 10 to 5.   Plus all the vendors around you are actually quite nice, friendly and even helpful. More over, the environment for the vendors is one that actually promotes helping one another as opposed to infighting or backstabbing which is really nice.\n\nIt's unfortunate that his first weekend wasn't a stellar one.  He made rent which is all that really matters but it would be nice if he had sold more his first weekend out if for no other reason than to inspire and excite..\n\n<a href=\"/images/2012/02/shop02.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Tellico Turnings\" src=\"/images/2012/02/shop02-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Tellico Turnings\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Peppermills and Stuff</span></a>\n\nProbably completely unrealistic for him to do better than he did considering it was;\n\na) his first weekend there and no one knew where he was,\nb) between pay days so no one had money,\nc) between major holidays so no one had a \"reason\" to buy things,\nd) there was a major dinosaur exhibit in town which kept the crowd down, and\ne) a large format gun show which also that kept the crowd down.. etc..\n\nAll that working against him and he still made enough sales to pay for itself..  So I guess I shouldn't complain too much.. I just really wanted him to sell out! hah\n\nFor me it was a disappointment but he's an old hat at doing markets and having a booth selling stuff and so he knows that it can be feast or famine.. he didn't seem put out by it at all..\n\nThe crowd Friday was admittedly dismal which apparently is very common there.. Saturday and Sunday however had a lot of folks coming through and just about all of them picked up stuff and took cards which is a great sign for his future there..\n\n<a href=\"/images/2012/02/shop03.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"Tellico Turnings\" src=\"/images/2012/02/shop03-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Tellico Turnings\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Wine table &amp; Lamps</span></a>\n\nMy only concern at this point is that his stuff is actually too nice for the venue and that people might think of the market more as a \"flea market\" than an actual hand crafted goods marketplace..   Only time will tell here and we probably don't need to do any second guessing at this early stage based on a single weekend..\n\nMore over I think it will take a couple weeks to figure out what works and what doesn't work and then adjust accordingly.  More than likely he's going to have to start adding a lot of less expensive stock that will sit next to the really nice stuff just to draw folks in..\n\nAfter all, selling 10x $5 items is just as good as selling a single $50 item..   Certainly a lot less fun to make but you gotta make stuff that sells..\n\n<a href=\"/images/2012/02/shop04.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Tellico Turnings\" src=\"/images/2012/02/shop04-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Tellico Turnings\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Dad in the background</span></a>\n\nAfter only a few days I had to return home and get back to work.. Apparently my boss wants me to actually \"earn\" my living.. psh.. slave driver I tell ya..\n\nI made the 1000 mile drive straight from East TN to Central Texas in under 16 hours and had a seriously sore backside to prove it..  I also had a SUV full of wood and project ideas, as well as plans to make some signage for the shop.\n\nAll in all it was a great trip and one I'll likely make again in the future.\n\nI really like Tennessee and one of these days will likely move there more permanently..  For now I'm stuck in Texas though... Y'all.\n\nThe trip was really great and it was fun to hang out with the folks but it really made me realize that my home is where ever my wife is.. sappy, but true.\n\n","previous":{"next":{"path":"_posts/2012-02-29-dads-new-store.md","url":"/dads-new-store/","relative_path":"_posts/2012-02-29-dads-new-store.md","id":"/dads-new-store","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Hobbies"],"layout":"post","title":"My latest trip to TN and Dads new store","tags":["Wood Working"],"type":"post","published":true,"image":"/images/2012/02/shop00.jpg","allow_comments":true,"date":"2012-02-29 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"dads-new-store","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2012-02-13-scroll-saw-and-mlt-13-wooden-clock.md","output":null,"content":"<a href=\"/images/2012/02/clockgears14.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Gear Test Fit!\" src=\"/images/2012/02/clockgears14-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Gear Test Fit!\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Latest Image</span></a>\n\nI have always been a very artsy-craftsy^(1) person as I thoroughly enjoy making things.  I like working with my hands and creating something from nothing.   I've made leather and steel armor for the SCA, bows and crossbows and a mandolin that actually doesn't sound half bad.  I've done some wood turning and created all manner of pens, peppermills and even a rolling pin and I have even tried my hand at making furniture -- I'm not bad at it!   For whatever reason I seem to have a knack for crafting.\n\nSo in my time, I have worked with wood, steel, leather, plastic and various resins and agates..  The thing I have noticed is that no matter what I craft, I always seem to come back to wood.    There's something about wood that I am not sure I can put to words;  It's just easy to work with in that it's forgiving, versatile and beautiful.\n\nThe problem is no matter what I have made with wood (and there has been a lot) not any particular piece or style has ever really \"grabbed me\" as something I really enjoyed and wanted to do a lot of.\n\nMy father is an avid wood turner who cranks out pens, bowls and other awesome stuff that he sells at his own little shop and I have to admit, that's really inspiring..  He's making a living by turning a hunk of nothing, into <a href=\"http://www.tellicoturnings.com/products.html\" target=\"_blank\">something beautiful</a> that other folks want!  That's cool as hell.\n\nI tried my hand at turning for a while and it is fun but I don't know that it's \"the thing\" for me.  I like putting  a randomly shaped block or log of wood on the mandrel and shaping it into something new, but you're somewhat limited in what you can make..   I thought turning pens was fun, but those pen kits are expensive and the more I think about it the more I want to create something entirely out of wood without having to rely on some pre-made mass produced (over priced) internal kit..    I think it's one of the main reasons my father has gone to making bowls instead of the pen kits or even pepper mills..  He's creating something entirely unique that's 100% his own without any outside help.. (except tooling which doesn't count!)\n\nSo I have been pondering for a while what I could make that would excite me and be that thing that I enjoyed doing in my spare time..   I did enjoy the <a title=\"Mandolin Luthiery — Making and playing the Mandolin\" href=\"/mandolin-luthiery/\" target=\"_blank\">Mandolin experiment</a> but the more I worked on it the more I realized that it wasn't for me..  I think it's a good augment skill, sort of like turning, but not as a mainstay.  Plus it's really hard to be a maker of instruments, that you don't play.  I have a nice mandolin and I plink around on it sometimes but I will never be a good mando player.   I don't think I have the time or patience..\n\nThe thing that I took from the mandolin though is that I enjoy making something that is both meticulous in nature and functional.  With a mandolin (or any instrument) you have to pay very close attention to minor details or the instrument will sound bad.  I like that.  It speaks to my special form of brain damage, but what can you do.\n\nSo I was pondering what I wanted to do craft-hobby wise and I remember having a book on wooden clocks that has been on my shelf collecting dust for a couple years.  I started reading it (the first time I had actually cracked the book open) and realized that \"hey I can totally do this.\"   I started doing some research and came across two master craftsmen who are as inspirational as they come;  <a href=\"http://lisaboyer.com/Claytonsite/Claytonsite1.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Clayton Boyer</a> and <a href=\"http://www.woodthatworks.com/\" target=\"_blank\">David C. Roy</a>.\n\nClayton makes clocks that are both functional and beautiful.  He puts a lot of attention to detail in his creations and thus generates some amazing works.  Of all of his clocks I very much like the workings of his <a href=\"http://lisaboyer.com/Claytonsite/marblestrikepage1.htm\" target=\"_blank\">marble strike clock</a> ^(2) it's mechanical and meticulous nature appeals to me.    Being able to make something like this is one of my ultimate goals. (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTQ-oCj-Gf8&amp;feature=player_embedded\" target=\"_blank\">video</a>)\n\nDavid makes breath-taking kinetic sculptures that are mesmerizing to behold.. His style really seems unique on the internet and his wood working skills are second to none.   All of his sculptures are extremely high quality and it's clear to me that this is a labor of love for him, not just a day job.   His sculptures vary in style, size, scope and ability so it's hard to boil them down to one I like best.. but if I were pressed I'd probably say I like his <a href=\"http://www.woodthatworks.com/kinetic-sculptures/shimmer/\" target=\"_blank\">shimmer sculpture</a> ^(3) the best primarily because it was the first one I saw that turned me on to the rest of his art, so that first stunned viewing has really stuck with me.. (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iQO_UUjDqM&amp;feature=player_embedded\" target=\"_blank\">video</a>)\n\nSo armed with a book of clock plans, some plans I ordered from Clayton, and with the inspirational works of Clayton, David and my father too look at -- I decided I want to make clocks with an ultimate goal of combining both the functionality of clocks with the raw artful beauty of kinetic sculptures.  If they can do it, so can I.\n\nMy wood working tool collection isn't vast, but I had all the major pieces of hardware I would need to proceed except for a scroll saw.  I researched a bunch of different saws and found that as with anything you can spend a little or a lot of one of these things..  I went ahead and ordered what I felt was a nice one, a Dewalt 20\" variable speed scroll saw.  Dewalt has always done right by me so I went for it.\n\nI have never done any scroll saw work before so there was a bit of a learning curve but not too bad.. I printed out the <a href=\"http://wooden-clockworks.com/MLT-13.html\" target=\"_blank\">MLT-13 Clock</a> from the scrollsaw book I had, ordered and received some wood from woodcrafters and was off to the races..   The MLT-13 doesn't seem overly complex as clocks go and I had the machine and plans before I got any of the plans from Clayton so I figured I'd start with it..\n\n<a href=\"/images/2012/01/clockgears01.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"Complete Escape and 3rd Wheel Cog\" src=\"/images/2012/01/clockgears01-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Complete Escape and 3rd Wheel Cog\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Faster on the scroll saw</span></a>\n\nThe first gear I cut was the escape wheel and I did so on my bandsaw.  It was pretty rough and needed a lot of sanding and trimming in order to get it to look right.  Here you can see the second and EW finished being cut on the scroll saw once I received it.  It was much much easier to cut these things out on the scroll saw.\n\nI tried using round blades for a while but I found they were really rough in their cut and it required a lot of time to sand and smooth the backs of gears to repair all the tear outs..  I have gone to using skiptooth blades for the bigger stuff and reverse tooth blades for the small fine work.\n\n<a href=\"/images/2012/02/clockgears06.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Gear Assembly and Light\" src=\"/images/2012/02/clockgears06-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Gear Assembly and Light\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Gear Assembly and Light</span></a>\n\nIt got to the point where I was basically going blind trying to see what it was I was doing..   My eyes aren't what they used to be so I went ahead and purchased a magnifier / hobby light that I mounted to my work bench so that it would sit just above the saw..\n\nThe nice thing about this setup is that it both serves to magnify and light my work, as well as being eye protection.  I was concerned with vibration since that's a heavy light and lens out on the end of a rather spindly arm, but the dewalt has virtually zero vibration so the light doesn't move at all (except when I bump it which happens all the time..)\n\n<a href=\"/images/2012/02/clockgears14.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"Gear Test Fit!\" src=\"/images/2012/02/clockgears14-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Gear Test Fit!\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Gear Test Fit!</span></a>\n\nAs of this picture you can see that I have all the major pieces cut out and am in the fitting process..  The only thing I have left to create at this point are the hands.\n\nThere is some minor binding between my gears that I need to work out, I foresee some serious time with sandpaper ahead of me, but even so they do turn nicely if not 100% smoothly.\n\n<a href=\"/images/2012/02/clockgears11.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img

get the pendulum, pallet and escape wheel assembly to actually ticking though.   I'm still in the process of getting the clutch working correctly..\n\nThe wife and I sat down and figured out the colors..  We are going to go for a walnut for the body pieces and a cherry for the gearing.  Not sure if I want to leave any of the gears \"nude\" or not.  Three colors might be a bit too much.\n\nFor my next trick, trying to capture the elusive tick!\n\n__Update: 17 Feb 2012__\n\n<a href=\"/images/2012/02/20120217-213343.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"Recut Escape

tick!\n\nHere you can see my recut escape wheel on the left compared to the old one on the right.  I spent two days recutting this thing making sure it was as good as I could make it.\n\nI cut out the pinion and glued on (not showed in the picture) and remounted the new wheel.. it works much better.. even though the differences are minute, it makes a huge difference.\n\nI had to do some shaping on the pallets and I need to resand them as they are rough which is one problem, but some of my other gears are binding a tiny bit which means no constant tick.. but I get 8 to 10 \"ticks\" out of it before it catches or stops.\n\nI also don't have enough weight hanging off the bottom so I need to address that.. but I'm really excited.. it's so close!\n\n__Update: 3 Sep 2013__\n\n<a

height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Disassembled</span></a>\n\nI can't believe it's been so long since I started working on this thing..  It has hung on my wall silent for months and today I pulled it down and started investigating it further.  I was so close brefore but have learned a lot since then, so I wanted to give it a nother try.\n\nI found that I had done a lot of things wrong that I need to correct, and aim to do that over the course of the next week or two.  I was really close before, but it would always grind to a halt.. I'm gonna fix that..\n\n\n---\n\n\n^(1) It's interesting to note that neither \"artsy\" nor \"craftsy\" are words according to Merriam Webster, but <a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/artsy-craftsy\" target=\"_blank\">together they are a word</a>..

It's just a masterpiece..\n\n^(3) A few words about <a href=\"http://www.woodthatworks.com/kinetic-sculptures/shimmer/\" target=\"_blank\">Shimmer by David C. Roy</a>:  David has done a lot of different sculptures over the last 20+ years and the level of detail and precision he employs is nothing but impressive.  I like quite a few of his sculptures, some more than others but they are all very cool.   The thing that I like the most about shimmer though is how deceptively simple it is combined with how eye catching and even mesmerizing it is.   I wasn't kidding when I said above that it was the first one I stumbled across and that initial viewing has really stuck with me..   Many of his other works are far more complex than this one, but to me the simplicity of this one is part of it's beauty.   It's really nothing more than a spring powered escape mechanism that powers a childs optical illusion rendered in wood.  Awesome!  Well done David.\n\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2012-01-03-2011-swtor-ipad2.md","url":"/2011-swtor-ipad2/","relative_path":"_posts/2012-01-03-2011-swtor-ipad2.md","id":"/2011-swtor-ipad2","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"2011, SWTOR, and iPad2","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2012/01/2012.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2012-01-03 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"2011-swtor-ipad2","ext":".md"},"url":"/scroll-saw-and-mlt-13-wooden-clock/","relative_path":"_posts/2012-02-13-scroll-saw-and-mlt-13-wooden-clock.md","id":"/scroll-saw-and-mlt-13-wooden-clock","collection":"posts","excerpt":"I have always been a very artsy-craftsy person as I thoroughly enjoy making things.  I like working with my hands and creating something from nothing.","draft":false,"categories":["Hobbies"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Scroll Saw and MLT-13 Wooden Clock","layout":"post","tags":["Wood Working","Scroll Saw","Clock"],"image":"/images/2012/02/Marble-Strike-by-Alain-Saintagne-1.jpg","ribbon":null,"tile_size":"2x2","private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2012-02-13 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"scroll-saw-and-mlt-13-wooden-clock","ext":".md"},"url":"/dads-new-store/","relative_path":"_posts/2012-02-29-dads-new-store.md","id":"/dads-new-store","collection":"posts","excerpt":"This last week I got to spend some quality time with the folks in Tennessee and more specifically time alone with my father (which I haven't gotten to do in years) at his new store.  It was pretty great!","draft":false,"categories":["Hobbies"],"layout":"post","title":"My latest trip to TN and Dads new store","tags":["Wood Working"],"type":"post","published":true,"image":"/images/2012/02/shop00.jpg","allow_comments":true,"date":"2012-02-29 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"dads-new-store","ext":".md"},"url":"/tellico-turnings-sign/","relative_path":"_posts/2012-03-02-tellico-turnings-sign.md","id":"/tellico-turnings-sign","collection":"posts","excerpt":"So while in Tennessee with my father, I told him I'd make him some signs for his shop...","draft":false,"categories":["Hobbies"],"layout":"post","title":"Tellico Turnings Sign","tags":["Wood Working","Scroll Saw"],"status":"publish","type":"post","published":true,"image":"/images/2012/03/signone.jpg","gallery":null,"tile_size":"1x3","allow_comments":true,"date":"2012-03-02 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"tellico-turnings-sign","ext":".md"}
