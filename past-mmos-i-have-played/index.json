My legs are very muscular and quite handy all things considered, but I think they are out to get me.\n\nOne of the latest medical fads is RLS, or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restless_legs_syndrome\" target=\"_blank\">restless leg syndrome</a>.  Before that it was actually called \"Active Leg Syndrome\" (Read: Doctors didn't have a clue what it was) and it sucks.  In my case I have a special version of it where not only do my legs creep and crawl all night (and day), but I also get whicked leg cramps and <a title=\"Oh how I hate you charley horse.. \" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charley_horse\" target=\"_blank\">charley horses</a> in my calfs..\n\nI have taken medication in the past and it typically does nothing.

(and just because I didnt mention it there, doesn't mean I haven't tried it.)\nAt one point I was even in a leg study where they gave me \"special\" medication and gave me leg monitors to wear for it so that they could collect \"special\" information.  This was back before they actually called it RLS, and nothing came of it.. Shortly after that study, RLS was released to the world as a treatable condition.. Hmmmm.. Interesting that it isn't treatable in me..\n\nThe number one problem of all this is the lack of sleep.  I don't get any sleep.  I might be able to eek out 3 hours a night, and anyone that knows me will tell you that only 3 hours ruins my cherub like demeanor..  The other fun side effect is that the near dibilitating, and somewhat shocking, pain of a charley horse at 4am usually lasts most of the next day.

Gone are the heady days of playing games with huge pixilated sprite based characters running down a two dimensional scrolling map dodging mushrooms and grabbing floating coins..\n\nMost games have embraced the power of 3D and have gotten so good at it, in fact, that sometimes you can't tell the game engine screen from reality.. Anyone that has played Half-life 2 can attest to that.\n\nThe problem with most of these games that strive to simulate ultra-reality is that they forget that they are doing so in an extremely unrealistic medium.\n\nFirst person shooter style games are very bad about this in that they will usually strive to deliver weaponry that is based on the real world equivalent..\n\nBut all games suffer from the same issues here, you can't simulate reality with a monitor and some speakers.. There is no way to get true surround sound or peripheral vision which goes a long way to inform us about our reality.\n\nTry walking around for a couple hours looking through toilet paper tubes. This would pretty accurately reflect what you're doing when looking at a game reality through the use of a monitor.\n\nUnfortunately, at this time there is no real worth while solution to that..\n\nBut another problem that comes up there is a solution to -- if you care enough to try;\n\nIn any game, if a problem or situation arises, you only have so many ways to deal with it. You can only do those things that the coders of the game programmed in as solutions.\n\nThat's very much unlike reality where if a problem occurs, you can think and be creative about how you want to solve it. And the solution you use to deal with a real world issue isn't going to be the same solution that someone else would come up with. It might be, but doesn't have to be.\n\nIn a game environment you can only solve issues the ways in which the programmers gave you to solve it. The more vast the game, then the more likely it is that there is only one solution to your particular issue simply because the coders don't have a lot of time to program in all the various ways to finish one thing. Thus, the solution you figured out for a problem in a game, is most likely the exact same way someone else will deal with it..\n\nNo creativity required.. infact.. no creativity allowed..\n\nThis is a huge barrier to every game out there and goes a long way to hurt every game there is simply because the programmers solution may not be intuitive to someone else..\n\nIf a game engine could be created that would allow players of the game to be creative.. allow them to try things, ANY thing.. things that the programmer had never intended in the first place.. And do it in such away as to not break or exploit the game.. I believe that game would blow the rest of them out of the water..\n\nThis change in mind set on how games work and allowing players this sort of freedom would bring a whole new level of \"reality\" to games. While it doesn't solve the monitor issue.. it does allow that creativity that has been otherwise stifled up to now.\n\nEverquest2 is a good game but very much suffers from the \"no creativity {thinking} required\" problem.\n\nQuests are given to you by NPC's and you run around \"solving\" the quest. But \"solving\" to these people doesn't entail puzzles that change and it certainly doesn't allow you to be creative about the answers, but rather it means that you have to go one step at a time doing something and then run back to the NPC to update it to the next step.. Etc.. Sometimes it's hard to not drool.. They are completely scripted.. There is typically only one answer to each step..\n\nFor some reason, this is a popular system.. Everquest2 has thousands of such quests. \"No creativity required\".\n\nI'm not picking on Everquest2.. I have played it from the beginning and will for the foreseeable future.. All games suffer from this.\n\nI find it funny that most massively multiplayer online games call themselves role playing games. And yet if you seriously play you realize that role playing in games like this is all but dead. Mostly because creativity is stifled by the game engine itself.\n\nThis is something that will have to be addressed at the very core of the game engine.\n\nThere are many solutions to every problem in the modern day world, so why do we limit everyone in a game to one solution only? This harkens back to the days of M.U.D.'s when everything was text based and you had to type in exactly what the programmer had typed in to get something to work. \"Open the chest with the large skeleton key.\"\n\nWhen we went to a graphical interface they simply gave you a single button to push, as opposed to allowing for something more..\n\nNo key? Try your foot.. try hitting it with a hammer.. try tossing it off a cliff.. A suitable application of explosives might work.. How about a laser?\n\nSo how do we go about addressing this?\n\nHow do you let a person be creative in a game?\n\nI think first of all you have to start at the micro level in the game environment.\n\nA player needs to be able to manipulate EVERYTHING in the game environment. Everything in the game environment needs to have a \"physical\" presence and react accordingly when fiddle with by a player.\n\nThis alone is a huge undertaking.\n\nFrom there, you provide players with very simple abilities.. Pickup, put down.. move.. gather.. push.. pull.. lift.. drop.. throw.. hit.. kick.. etc..\n\nThose abilities combined with a physics engine and a reality engine would do the trick.\n\nThe physics engine would know that if you dropped a rubber ball from x height it would behave in y way. Standard physics..\n\nThe reality engine is the other trick -- and there is no reason you couldn't combine the two.. but I say keep them separate that way when the PPU's (Physics processor unit) come out in a couple years (and I believe they will) you can easily adapt..\n\nThe reality engine says.. if you drop this object, made of metal on these two wires one of which has electricity running through it.. it will cause a X reaction.. In this case a short.\n\nThat way if the solution to the player is to complete that circuit.. ANY metal object would do.. unless that metal object is a bomb.. then the reality engine would punish the player with a nice explosion.. etc..\n\nSee it's actually very simple.. you go down to the very core basic abilities that all humans have to manipulate things.. then apply the logic of what those things are and how they behave..\n\nBoom.. You have creativity. Or at least you have the starts of a system that would allow a person to be creative. Allow a player to think.. Get rid of the canned / scripted solutions.. Allow the players to devise their own clever solutions.\n","previous":{"next":{"path":"_posts/2005-01-02-creativity-in-modern-games.md","url":"/creativity-in-modern-games/","relative_path":"_posts/2005-01-02-creativity-in-modern-games.md","id":"/creativity-in-modern-games","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Creativity in modern games","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2005-01-02 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"creativity-in-modern-games","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2005-01-01-ambivalent-about-people.md","output":null,"content":"Sometimes I wish I were alone, out in space.. A lone trader.. Just trying to make a living.. Not bothering anyone.. More to the point, not being bothered.. This of course is a silly wish.. No one else in space to trade with as of this writing.. I think this irrational desire signifies my.... Contempt?... Dislike?... for other people. Though other times I want to be with people.. hang out.. if only just for a time.. Ambivalence? I dunno.\n\nMaybe it's a safety thing. Out in space, in my little ship.. I would only allow those people into my life that I specifically wanted there. Other people simply wouldn't get the password to my little club. A perfect way to live life without truly living. In my self contained cube with no chance of being hurt. No chance of forced interaction.\n\nSometimes that sounds wonderful. Other times it sounds frightening... Ambivalence?\n\nJust when I start to like people.. Just when I start to get comfortable with the way people are and accept them for who they want to be.. Just when I start to think the world is going to be okay.. Something comes along and reminds me that people, in general, are fucktards. Most people tread their way through their lives without giving one thought to everyone else around them.\n\nMost people think they are king, the ruler of the world.\nMost people think nothing bad could ever happen to them, and if it did it's someone else's fault.\nMost people think that there is no way they could be at fault, it is always someone else.\nMost people think their way is the right way and everyone else is wrong, period.\nMost people are wrong.\nMost people are in denial.\nMost people need a reality check.\nMost people need a life lesson.\n\nLife doesn't work the way you want it to in the pretty fantasy world. That is why I am not that lone space man with my perfectly chosen world. You aren't the only one living your life, everyone around you is living it too. Their actions are a direct result of your actions. Most of the time they aren't to blame, you are. Your way isn't always the right way, many times there are a bunch of right ways. Your way may be wrong. You don't know everything. Most likely, you don't really know anything. Take the time to look around and try if even only for a second, to grasp what is going on around you. You are not king. You aren't the center of the universe.\n\nI went to go see a movie the other day. Sat down just as my friends were arriving, we came in separate vehicles. Steve sat to my left, Pat to my right. Pat was drunk. Not fall down stupid drunk, but annoyingly loud drunk. Just drunk enough to not know when to shut up. I don't like drunk people. I don't hang out with drunk people. You wouldn't be invited in to my space ship if I knew you were drunk.\n\nThe movie started but there wasn't any sound. The pictures were moving but no sound was coming out. For about 5 minutes we watching a completely silent move. Boy was it dull. People around the audience were yelling at the screen and making fun. My \"friend\" Pat, the drunk one, kept saying quite loudly, \"fuck I really wanted to see this god damned movie.\" I tried to shhh him but he wouldn't have anything to do with it. It was a kids movie we had come to see, so there were quite a few children about the movie theater, not counting Pat of course. So I know that some of the parents around us were probably tired of hearing the cussing. And had they said anything, note I said 'SAID', we would have shut up and apologized. But that isn't what happened. Not at all.\n\n\"Damn! I really wanted to see this fucking movie!\"\n\nOf a sudden the guy in the seat in front of us jerked around and grabbed Pat. This pissed me off, immediately and completely. I leaned forward..\n\n\"Hey you need to keep your hands off my friend... I don't know who you think you are but...\" that's all I got out, before he cuffed me. He just backhanded me. Wasn't hard, just enough to get my attention and really annoy me. Good thing it wasn't a hard hit or it would have spawned a totally different reaction. One much less, pleasant.\n\n\"Are you out of your fucking mind?! You're going to just haul off and hit me in a movie theater?\" I yelled standing up.. Boy if I had thought the theater was quiet a second ago, it was nothing compared to now.\n\n\"Well you were cussing!\" he says, as if that is going to justify everything. Oh well okay then..\n\n\"OH .. Cussing is a mortal sin, but hauling off and smacking someone.. That's okay.. If you have a problem with something someone is doing you ask, or you get the manager you don't put your hands on someone.. \"\n\n\"Well I will go get the manager.. \" {'cause I'm a yutz and can't play well with others and have no clue how to solve this myself}\n\n\"Oh.. we are just trying to watch a movie,\" his fat wife sitting next to his two kids says, \" and you terrible people just ruined it..\"\n\nOh come on lady. Your charming husband just smacked me and it's our fault? I bet he beats you too huh. I mean if this guy.. this manly man, is willing to whack someone in a theater.. A complete stranger no less, I bet he hits you at home all the time. What about the kiddies? Daddy come home after a bad day and spank them too? 'cause they deserved it', I'm sure.\n\nSo he leaves and goes and gets the management.. Or at least that is what I supposed. He comes back with 3 or 4 sixteen year olds that are the cleaners of the theaters. It's funny that he went and got a bunch of them, like they were going to muscle us out of the theater.. hah Joke.\n\nThis story is totally anticlimactic by the way -- So, if you are reading it hoping that someone pulls a gun out or something you are going to be disappointed..\n\nWe were escorted out of the theater and into the lobby area where I confronted this guy. I basically told him that he had no right to put his hands on anyone and that he certainly had no right to hit me. Which of course he denied. I told him that if we were bothering him he can ask us to stop. And if we continue to bother him he can get the manager or the police. That's it. Those are his options. So what does he do? Guess...\n\nHe gets the cops. The theater that I frequent is a nice new theater and for whatever reason they keep a police officer on staff. For unruly customers like me I guess. He goes off and explains to the officer about how we were being terrible people and how he asked us three times to be quiet and how we refused and were doing it just to spite him.. huh?! Where the fuck did that version of reality take place.. He thinks he is king and that there is no way he could be at fault.. What I don't get is how he thinks he could be right.. I mean he smacks me and then HE goes and gets the cops? Why is this idiot continuing to escalate this situation? I could have pressed charges and he would have been in cuffs. I didn't.. But I could have. I consider myself a better person than that. It just saddens me that this person wasn't.\n\nHe single handedly reaffirmed my animosity towards other people.. Well.. animosity is a strong word.. Maybe ambivalence.. I must admit I seriously wanted to pop this guy in the nose. I just can't fathom how he thinks he could be right. I can't count the number of times when I was wrong on something and I apologized, \"Woops.. Hey man.. I was wrong.. sorry..\" I have done that before and will do that again..\n\nWhy couldn't this guy do that? My father used to tell me all the time that it's better to be the bigger person, the better man if you will and just let it go. But it doesn't feel as good. I really wanted to teach this guy a lesson. But who am I? Maybe I am wrong. Either way.. I walked away.. What a jerk. Yet another person who thought they were king. Someone, one day will squash his delusional rule. I just wasn't sure that person should have been me..
