I have two 40k armies; Tau and Orks.  I like them both and am not really looking to change them..   But right now I only really have one fantasy army;  Skaven.  I love my rats, but I want to find another army to play and have been looking for a while..  I tried Ogre's and I tried Tomb Kings but really didn't get into them.  I have a lot of TK stuff painted up and I very much like the models and the lore, but for whatever reason the TK army just doesn't excite me..  The Ogre's never even got that far..\n\nSo I'm back on the hunt and I think I have settled on getting a Daemons of Chaos list going.\n\nI think all of the models are pretty neat, and I like that that its sorta 4 armies in one; one list for each god.  Something that also appeals on a lesser level is the fact that they are the exact same models used in Fantasy and 40k.. So if you have them ready to go in Fantasy, its easy to use them in 40k.  (Just have to solve the bases problem which I'll get to in a moment.. )\n\nMy number one reason for picking this army is because I dig the models.  I am most likely going to go an all Slaanesh army, or if that's not viable I'll fill in with Nurgle or Khorne..   I'm going to leave Tzeentch out because it seems it's what ever one is doing and I like doing things others aren't..\n\nI really look forward to painting these guys (gals?) up.. I think the Slaanesh models all look pretty cool and should be quite fun to paint.. I know I wont get anywhere near as good results as the professional painters do, but still they look good and should come out okay..\n\nThe only issue at this point is that the new core rule book is coming out in July and is rumored to nurf the Daemons down something harsh..  If the current rumors hold true then the DoC army as a whole may be unplayable.. I find that unfortunate, but not enough to dissuade me from getting the army in the first place..\n\nI have also heard tell that half the reason for the new rule book is to correct issues in the DoC army and a couple other newer armies that introduced issues into the game.. It's really too bad they feel the need to completely rewrite the main rules, instead of just fixing the issue with the individual army..\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2010/04/daemonette.jpg\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"daemonette\" src=\"/images/2010/04/daemonette-e1272512468652-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Fantasy and 40k approved!</span></a>\n\n__The Bases__:  So, I listed above that these models can be used in both fantasy and 40k.. that's pretty cool.. The only issue is that fantasy uses square bases, and 40k uses round bases.  That issue can be complicated further by the fact that 40k bases are one inch in diameter, and fantasy bases are typically 20mm or 25mm square..  So, if you want to use the same models in both games (as opposed to buying the same models twice.. ) then you have to get clever about your bases..\n\nI solved it this way;\n\n1.  I got some washers that are smaller around than both the 40k bases and the fantasy bases you're going to use.  With the Daemonettes I was in luck, they use  25mm bases so I could get a slightly larger washer than if I was stuck with 20mm bases.  Also make sure the washers have as small a center hole as possible.  The washers I'm using are 7/8 (0.87\") with a 7/32 (0.20\") inner hole, got them at Lowes for $3 or $4 for a hand full..\n\n2. I then assembled the model as I wanted it and glued it to the top of one of the washers -- trying very hard not to foul the hole in the washer.\n\n3. I then drilled 4 itty bitty holes in the base and stuck in some of the tiny magnets I have.   I mean it these things are small.. 0.05\" is small man..  4 of them hold the washer down nicely, and are small enough to not cause clustering.. (Where a bunch of magnets jump to one another.. )  Drill all the way through the base with a drill bit slightly smaller than the magnet, and then enlarge it a bit by in and out movements..  This is a tiny hobby drill bit.. Once that's done, I glued the magnets in from the underside so they wont go anywhere.\n\n4. I then got a dowel from Walmarts hobby area that was the exact fit for the washers..  You can get a bag of like 20 of them for $0.89..   I drilled a whole in the direct center of the base and pushed the dowel through.. I had to be very careful not to split the base.. And I made sure to push the down through the hole a bit so that it touches the table the same time the edges of the base does.  It helps with gluing later.\n\n5.  I then took the thinnest washer I had ( they are varying thicknesses for some odd reason ) and slid it down the dowel until to stuck to the magnets..  Put the dowel in a vice, and used a coping saw to cut the dowel at the washer.  Once that was done I applied glue to the underside, again ensuring that nothing goes anywhere.\n\n6.  And that's it..  Paint and flock it up.. When you flock the square base you want to make sure that you use an extra washer because it gets kinda nasty.. And when it dries you might have to do some minor surgery to get that washer off.. I had to carefully Xacto around the edges to free it from its flocky jail..\n\nClick the image to see the results.. it works out nicely..  The 40k round bases snaps up in there and only requires a touch of flocking on the top of the dowel.. the fantasy base you see snaps down nicely too almost 100% hiding the washer..\n","collection":"posts","url":"/daemons-of-chaos/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2010-04-30-tron-2-lightcycle.md","collection":"posts","url":"/tron-2-lightcycle/","path":"_posts/2010-04-30-tron-2-lightcycle.md","id":"/tron-2-lightcycle","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Tron 2 Lightcycle","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2010/04/troncycle01.jpg","ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x2","private":true,"allow_comments":false,"date":"2010-04-30 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"tron-2-lightcycle","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2010-04-27-daemons-of-chaos.md","excerpt":"So I prefer Warhammer Fantasy to 40k..  I just think the rules are better, and the game as a whole has a lot of tactics and strategy to it, where as 40k is written more for the kids to be a fast paced shoot'em'up style game.  I still play 40k, but I prefer fantasy..","id":"/daemons-of-chaos","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Games Workshop -- Warhammer: Daemons of Chaos","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2010/04/kos-150x150.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":true,"allow_comments":false,"date":"2010-04-27 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"daemons-of-chaos","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2010-04-30-tron-2-lightcycle.md","content":"<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2010/04/troncycle01.jpg\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Tron Lightcycle\" src=\"/images/2010/04/troncycle01-e1272648379482-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Tron Lightcycle\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Tron Lightcycle</span></a>\n\nI want one..\n\nSo I have gone above and beyond out of my way to avoid learning any details about Tron 2..

NTW is by far the most refined version so far and a lot of fun but, I'm not quite sure it peeks the \"great\" meter just yet.. I will say its pretty darn good and a lot of fun though..\n\nTotally worth the price as it's clear to me that Creative Assembly (the developers) are getting better at their craft but the game has one staggering short fall that it shares with all it's siblings;  Horrible AI.\n\nThis is the 6th iteration of the game core concept and the AI is still just dreadful..  I'm pretty sure we could train a monkey to play the game better..  I know AI is very complex and as a programmer myself I'm not sure how to solve this problem, but dang..  The computer is down right bad.   Given enough time you probably could beat any army with just about any force..  It's actually fun trying to do just that.. heh\n\nIn comparison to Empire Total War, it's immediate predecessor, Napoleon is the clear winner.  The game is much more polished and refined than ETW ever was and it makes me feel like ETW was what NTW was supposed to be, but they ran out of time and money..  I will say that the AI in NTW is better than ETW, but when up is the only possible direction....\n\nI will say this, NTW is beautiful.. There is nothing cooler than watching your line of infantry slowly disappear in a hazy cloud of black powder smoke as a line of enemy advance forward.. Or the small skip gashes that are cut into the scenery as a cannon ball goes whizzing by.. Great stuff..  The level of care and detail there is pretty high..\n\nBut the AI is so dumb that the enemy unit of 120 line infantry will happily walk into a line of cannon..  Or horse melee units that charge into the barriers (only to die immediately in droves)..  Or how the diplomacy system is completely pointless..etc..\n\nThe AI is the killer.. It's just not good..\n\nOne way they got around that was to introduce the notion of \"drop in battles\" in which you can, during your single player campaign, enlist a friend (or complete stranger even) to play the part of the enemy during some of the battles.   I will admit.. This was a damn good and innovative idea.. Well done guys..  I love this..\n\nWhats nice about it is that the other player when he's playing your enemy, or when you're playing his enemy in his campaign, isn't really invested in the same way..  So if he loses it's almost like it's not a personal loss.. after all its not like you chose the force..etc..   I like it.. this was a good addition to the game..\n\nFor the next iteration of the game I hope they go more into the trading, and economy aspects of the game.   I want to be able to set individual tax rates for a single province.. or define whats being traded where..etc..  Right now its fairly limited.. you're either trading or not.. etc..  I know this game is more about the killin and less about things like trade and diplomacy but I still would like a more rounded game experience in these areas..\n\nAll in all... Not \"great\".. but pretty damn good and a lot of fun against like minded friends..\n\nAdditional;\n\nI really think Games Workshop should get with Creative Assembly and make Warhammer Total War.. Dear god.. talk about two franchises that absolutely belong together..  This engine, plus GW's IP?!  WIN!!  It would be like chocolate and peanut butter man..\n\nHow cool would it be to see a pack of Skaven march into a pack of Witchelves (dead Skaven)..  Or see a bunch of Jezzails take out some Coldone Knights.. etc..  Hot..\n\nI think this is such a good idea I'm going to send them a letter...\n","collection":"posts","url":"/game-review-napoleon-total-war/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2010-05-13-game-review-napoleon-total-war.md","collection":"posts","url":"/game-review-napoleon-total-war/","path":"_posts/2010-05-13-game-review-napoleon-total-war.md","id":"/game-review-napoleon-total-war","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Game Review: Napoleon Total War","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2010/05/napoleon-150x150.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":true,"allow_comments":false,"date":"2010-05-13 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"game-review-napoleon-total-war","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2010-06-29-fuck-you-citibank.md","content":"<img class=\"pull-right\" title=\"citibank_logo\" src=\"/images/2010/06/citibank_logo.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"320\" height=\"214\" />\n\nI have been a Citibank member for 15 years.  I got my first Citicard in 1995 while I was in the military after I got back from Korea because I figured it was time to go ahead and start working on my credit..\n\nI have always tried to keep a balance off of it, but there have been a couple  years where just due to the times I couldn't help but carry a small balance..\n\nWell the other day I went to pay off my card and I noticed that they bumped my APR to 29.998%...   Are you fucking kidding me?  30% APR is highway robbery..\n\nI called them up and asked them to lower my rate and they refused..  The operator I got ahold of (once I navigated their automated system) told me that \".. they were unable to lower my rate at this time. Thanks for calling.. *click*\"\n\nI immediately called them back and told the new operator (that I got after navigating their automated system.. again) that I wanted to cancel my account and that it was due to their recent rate hike.. I have zero intention of paying 30% and that's ludicrous..   He said, \"but wait.. what if we lowered your APR would that make you stay?\"\n\nI explained that the previous operator told me there was no way to lower my rate.. So I want to cancel the account.. (2)..  He came back explaining that he could lower my rate to 26% for 6 months.. (after which it would spring back to 30%)..  I said that this was a bunch of crap, that if this was such a deal why didn't the last guy offer it and that 26% is still robbery..  No thank you, I'd like to cancel my account.. (3)..\n\n\"But wouldn't you like to lower your rate?\" ..   I explained that if he could lower my rate to 0% I'd stick around, otherwise, I'd like to cancel my account.. (4)..  \"No you want to lower your rate, so that the remaining balance doesn't take that 30% rate, but instead gets this much lower rate... \"  (26% is \"much lower\")..  I told him that I just paid the account off, online.. that there is no remaining balance and that I'd like to cancel my account.. (5)..\n\nBut.. blah blah.. and blahdiddy blah..   I'd like to cancel my account.. (6).. if you keep pestering me to lower my rate I will ask to speak to your manager..\n\n\"Id be more than happy to let you speak to my manager..  but golly we need to lower this rate.. blah blah bullshit bullshit I'm a douche blah blah blah\"..   I'd like to cancel my fucking account please.. (7).. and now I want to speak to your manager..\n\nI honestly was getting really pissed.. this asshat wouldn't let me just cancel the damn account..  I don't want it any more.. you're trying to screw me, and I refuse to do business with you..  Take your \"amazing low rate of 26%\" and shove it up your ass..  cancel my account.. I shouldn't have to ask for this 7+ times.. (I'm sure it was more than 7.. this is very much the short version.. )\n\nEventually he asks me to hold (I fully expected him to just hang up the phone..)  A minute or so later someone got on the line claiming to be his manager and I told him that I wanted to cancel the account and that I shouldn't have to ask so many times, and that I shouldn't be pressured to do something I don't want to do.. I want to cancel the account.. Period.. I'm done working with you..\n\nHe said, \"Fine it's canceled, do you want confirmation of the cancelation?\"  -- \"You're damn skippy.. \"  --  \"It will be sent to your billing address.. *click*\"\n\nThe manager was rude as hell..  I should never have had to deal with him.. The initial call taker should be fired to be honest.. Or retrained at best..\n\nAs to Citibank..  I'm done with you..  Jack my rate to 30% which should be criminal, and then as of April 1st 2010, charge a $60 annual fee just to have the card?!   That's $60 a year, just to have that card empty in your wallet.  Are you kidding me?  This is some kind of joke right?\n\nIt's clear to me that Citibank doesn't give a rats ass about their members if this is the way they plan to treat us..   So fine.. Bye.. I'm done with Citibank forever.. I wont do business with you ever again.. period.\n\nMore over I plan to tell as many people as possible not to do business with Citibank as they are clearly a bunch of crooks..\n","collection":"posts","url":"/fuck-you-citibank/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2010-07-03-lost-in-the-woods-of-c-sharp.md","collection":"posts","url":"/lost-in-the-woods-of-c-sharp/","path":"_posts/2010-07-03-lost-in-the-woods-of-c-sharp.md","id":"/lost-in-the-woods-of-c-sharp","draft":false,"categories":["Software Development"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Lost in the woods of C#","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2010/07/csharpquestion.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2010-07-03 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"lost-in-the-woods-of-c-sharp","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2010-06-29-fuck-you-citibank.md","excerpt":"Well the other day I went to pay off my card and I noticed that they bumped my APR to 29.998%...   Are you fucking kidding me?  30% APR is highway robbery..
