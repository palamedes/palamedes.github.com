<p>When will companies learn that their draconian efforts to prevent piracy only serves to hurt their paying customers which directly affects their bottom line!!</p>

<p>Companies, you must stop counting pirated copies of your software as “lost revenue” – it’s not!  Someone who is willing to pirate software isn’t willing to pay for it.. EVER!  So you never had their money in the first place..</p>

<p>You’re trying so hard to capture that imagined lost revenue that it’s blinding you to how badly you’re screwing yourselves and your real customers..</p>

<p>Equating the number of pirated copies of your software directly to dollars is retarded.. More over, implementing these harsh DRM models only serves to prevent the honest players from playing your games, which effectively assures that you’re going to lose real money in the form of people who actually DO buy your games going else where..</p>

<p>Let take the new Silent Hunter 5 game as an example..   SH5 (a game with a lot of bugs and other issues that already pisses paying customers off) comes with the new DRM which forces you to be connected to the internet 100% of the time.   The new system which the Ubisoft exec’s spin as being a positive thing for the customer is constantly phoning home to make sure you’re still allowed to play the game.. The game you purchased.</p>

<p>If at any time during your play period the connection to the mother ship fails, you stop playing the game.  You can’t save your game.. You can’t do anything..  Effectively the game you purchased goes into cripple ware mode..  This is bullshit.</p>

<p>The hacker community took one good look at that and said “F’to you Ubi” and hacked it within the first 24 hours of release..  These people had no intention of buying the game in the first place so who does it actually hurt?</p>

<p>ME!  If I’m playing the game that I purchased and I go on a road trip with my laptop, I can’t play it..  The hacker can.. he can play just fine..</p>

<p>If I am playing the game that I purchased at home and for whatever reason my internet goes out (it happens), I’m screwed..   Not the hacker.. He can keep playing..</p>

<p>So.. whats my recourse?  Nothing.. I’m just shit out of luck.. I have to either accept their crappy DRM because apparently they think I’m the problem, or not buy the game in the first place..  The hacker doesn’t care, he isn’t troubled by these problems at all and in no way has the DRM affected him at all..</p>

<p>DRM only punishes the paying customer!  Ubisoft is trying like hell to spin their new DRM in a positive light, but it’s not..  they claim that it’s “A platform of online services for PC titles offering gamers a more in-depth gaming experience as well as providing an innovative solution for reducing PC game piracy.”   HUH?!</p>

<p>How did you do either of those things?   It does absolutely NOTHING to offer me a more in-depth gaming experience and in fact does the opposite in that suddenly I have this invasive piece of software on my system that prevents me from playing at all from time to time..  I paid for the game, yet I’m punished.</p>

<p>And it doesn’t prevent or even reduce software piracy considering it was hacked out in the first 24 hours.  The hackers never even notice the games DRM, it doesn’t bother them in the slightest..</p>

<p>At this point you’re actually encouraging people like me to hack the game because your own DRM is preventing the honest player from playing the game he paid for..  That’s right.. your DRM which is there to prevent piracy is actually encouraging piracy because otherwise we can’t play the game..  Good job genius..</p>

<p>You’re so busy counting the imaginary lost dollars you’re missing the fact that your real dollars are heading out the door.. The proof is in the pudding.. Your current sales for this year are down by over 20% and I have to think you only have yourselves to blame..</p>

<p>I realize fully that the “higher ups” are the ones making these decisions, but someone MUST stand up and tell them why DRM is not the right solution..  If you guys don’t stop the DRM shenanigans you guys are going to hemorrhage not money, but customers..</p>
