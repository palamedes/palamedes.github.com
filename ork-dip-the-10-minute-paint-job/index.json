getting back into 3D modeling lately and ran into my old nemesis -- texturing!  For whatever reason, I had never really been very good at texturing.  I think a lot of that was due to the way Lightwave did textures.  It used to be extremely painful to texture a model because there wasn't really a good workflow..\n\nPreviously you'd have to export your UV's and do some texturing work in photoshop or some such, then import them back to the model, then render it... just to test your outcome.   It would take a long time to get something looking even half good.  It just wasn't easy workflow wise causing me not to want to do it.. thus, I sucked at it..\n\nModern day texturing is so much easier it's not even funny.  Now-a-days software allows you to directly paint on the model!  It's so awesome seeing your model update in near real time as you paint on it.\n\nIt's so powerful and so much easier to use.  The only thing you really need to use to take full advantage of that is a graphics tablet.   So this weekend, I went out and purchased a \"Bamboo\" Wacom tablet for $69.  What a steal!  This thing is awesome.   I realize there are several thousand dollar versions of this tablet and ot be honest I'm not sure what they bring to the table.  This tablet is fantastic and does such a great job I can't imagine needing anything else.\n\nI know they make a super expensive one that is also a monitor so you can see exactly what you're working on directly on the tablet, sure that'd be dang nice but other than that I don't know what the really expensive ones give you over the Bamboo.\n\nI'm very happy with it.  Modo 3D by Luxology is the 3D application I'm currently using to paint and model my stuff.  It is designed to use a pen and does so perfectly.  I still haven't quite mastered UV creation but I'm pretty close I think.  All in all the tablet was a good purchase and I would recommend one to anyone wanting to get that kind of detail out of their work.\n","collection":"posts","url":"/wacom-bamboo-graphics-tablet/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2009-05-19-40k-leman-russ.md","collection":"posts","url":"/40k-leman-russ/","path":"_posts/2009-05-19-40k-leman-russ.md","id":"/40k-leman-russ","draft":false,"categories":["Hobbies"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"40k

Render</span></a>\n\nWhile my <a href=\"/tau-hammerhead-in-3d/\" target=\"_self\">Tau Hammerhead</a> is coming along nicely, I needed a bit of a break from it.  I decided to model something from either the Imperial Guard or Space Marines codex.  I don't have either army, but I do have a Leman Russ that I was planning on turning into an Ork battlewagon..  So it seemed like the natural choice for modeling..\n\nThe model is still in pieces which as actually a boon because I can hold and model each part individually and then assemble them.. or at least I hope its that easy..\n\nAs with the hammerhead I plan to show a render of the model for every 4 hours (or so) of work.\n\n*Note: This post will be updated a lot as I work on this model.*\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2009/05/leman-russ-01.jpg\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"Leman Russ 01\" src=\"/images/2009/05/leman-russ-01-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Leman Russ 01\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Leman Russ 01</span></a>\n\nFirst 4 hours -- Believe it or not, that's 4-ish hours there.   I wanted to take advantage of instancing for all the bolts and rivots as well as the spiral lathe for the springs.. took me a bit to figure that out..\n\nWhat's nice is, there is actually only ONE rivet and only ONE bolt assembly.  They are then instanced into the 8 bolt assemblies, and 90+ rivets you see here.  This means all I have to do is adjust one rivet, or one bolt and the others will match.. Or more importantly, texture only one and you texture them all.. Yay!\n\nThis mesh promises to be WAY cleaner than the Hammerhead mesh which at this point I'm embarrassed by..\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2009/05/leman-russ-02.jpg\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Leman Russ 02\" src=\"/images/2009/05/leman-russ-02-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Leman Russ 02\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Leman Russ 02</span></a>\n\n+2 hours -- Okay I have added more features and details to the side of the hull.. The two side doors are open to the world now, as well as adding various other bits and greebles.  I'll add doors later, as well as adding the sponson which can be used or not depending on the vehicle I actually want..  (Lots of different vehicles in the 40k universe use the same basic body.)  I have also started working on the track which I have to figure out how to correctly shape itself around the hull.  I know Modo has an ability to do this, but not sure what it is..  I may have to poke around on the forums to figure this one out..  (Note: the track is currently WAY undersized, I realizes this and it will be fixed)  All in all it's going wonderfully.. I'm enjoying this quite a bit!\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2009/05/leman-russ-03.jpg\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"Leman Russ 03\" src=\"/images/2009/05/leman-russ-03-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Leman Russ 03\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Leman Russ 03</span></a>\n\n+6 hours -- or maybe even a bit more..  So for this addition you'll note that there hasn't been a huge addition.. but it took a long time..  That's due to the tank track.. Holy crap I want to club a baby seal..  It took me ages to get the tracks in place and working.\n\nI ended up having to do the entire thing by hand since the path instancing tool in modo just doesn't work as advertised.  I followed all the tutorials I could find and none of them work.  It's a really simple process too, but the results were completely wrong each time, OR the application would just crash..   It really irritated me to no end..\n\nBut at this point the tracks are in place and ready to go, as well as having the room to put in the roadwheels and what not behind the scenes, which I will do next.   Once I get those in place I can start adding the main body..  That or working on a sponson.. not sure which yet\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2009/05/leman-russ-04.jpg\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Leman Russ 04\" src=\"/images/2009/05/leman-russ-04-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Leman Russ 04\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Leman Russ 04</span></a>\n\n+3 hours -- I finally completed the back/inner side of the tread housing.. The sides of the tank are pretty much complete at this time, sans the sponsons and texturing.. *gleee*   The more I look at the track the more I think they are a bit too thin.. I'll have to beef them up a tad, but in order to do that I have to redo them all the way around the housing.. Ugh.. I'll get to it..\n\nI have instanced and mirrored the main side in order to see an opposite.. I'm trying to figure out about how far apart they should be for the tank innards to fit..   This render also signals a slightly different render style from the others.. I'm adding in the ambient occlusion data for the render in order to give the image a more gritty film look..  Fun fun!\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2009/05/leman-russ-05.jpg\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"Leman Russ 05\" src=\"/images/2009/05/leman-russ-05-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Leman Russ 05\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Leman Russ 05</span></a>\n\n+2 hours -- Roughing out the hull!  Well I have the basics of the hull roughed out..  Now for the painful process of multiplying every single edge around the entire thing to soften them a tad.  I typically would edge bevel everything but that's just about the worst way to actually do it apparently..\n\nOnce I get the hull to subdivide the way I want/need it to such that it maintains the shape while providing clean lines I'll start working on the hull mounted cannon.   I haven't forgotten the sponsons or the track fix.. I'll get to it.\n\nAt this point I'm not sure the best way to go about subpatching the hull.. I have tried a couple things and the results were never very good..  I'm going to post on the Luxology forums and see if they have any advice.. most the folks over there are stupidly gifted when it comes to this stuff.. someone is bound to have an idea..\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2009/05/leman-russ-06.jpg\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Leman Russ 06\" src=\"/images/2009/05/leman-russ-06-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Leman Russ 06\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Leman Russ 06</span></a>\n\n+5 hours -- I spent today touching up a lot of things with the russ.. The tracks are looking a lot better now.  I thickened them up quite a bit, though you really can't tell that via the render.. they are actually twice as thick as they were before..\n\nI haven't quite decided what I want to do about the hull with regards to rounding and what not.. My traditional method is to edge bevel instead of subpatch.. but subpatching looks way way better..  So I dunno..  I'll probably just bevel this one too.. Either way, while thinking about that I went ahead and created the sponson and the bolter.. It's just about 100% accurate, but looks kinda plain.. There aren't a lot of details on there.. I might have to spice it up a tad..\n\nI did create the 40k Imperial Aquila though.. I figured if I'm gonna have it on there its not going to just be a texture.. It's gonna be modeled onto the tank.  I'll have to put it in a bunch of places so I figured I might as well do a good job of it..   Came out quite nicely I think..\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2009/05/40k-imperial-aquila-01.jpg\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"40k Imperial Aquila 01\" src=\"/images/2009/05/40k-imperial-aquila-01-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"40k Imperial Aquila 01\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>40k Imperial Aquila 01</span></a>\n\n+2 hours -- I have completely redone the 40k Imperial Aquila.  The version that is in the 06 picture is good, and actually better looking than the one on the model, but my buddy who knows about these things explained how it was still wrong.  So with that I completely redid it using an even more accurate picture to make the model.\n\nI went WAY over board heh.. Each Aquila has over 3k polygons..  That's more than the entire sponson.. Bolter and all..\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2009/05/leman-russ-sds-example-01.jpg\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Leman Russ SDS Example 01\" src=\"/images/2009/05/leman-russ-sds-example-01-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Leman Russ SDS Example 01\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Leman Russ SDS Example 01</span></a>\n\n+6 hours -- Thanks to the information provided by folks like <a href=\"http://www.luxology.com/community/profile_pop.aspx?name=Michael+Blackbourn\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Blackboum</a> and <a href=\"http://www.luxology.com/community/profile_pop.aspx?name=Richard+Hurrey\" target=\"_blank\">Richard Hurrey</a> I am going through and adding the edges necessary to correctly subpatch the body of the Leman Russ..\n\nIt's a lot of work.. basically for each edge becomes roughly 7 edges.. (hard to explain that without pictures.. but just believe me.. )  So its a lot of polygon slicing..  The main point of which will be to give the hull a \"real\" look.   I could have just beveled all of the hard edges but that starts to a ) fail at certain intersections and b ) look less real as you zoom in.\n\nConsider is this;  Imagine if you will two polygons intersecting at a 90 degree angle.  In reality nothing short of a razor blade has an edge like the one those two polygons have now created..  it just doesn't look real.  By adding a bevel you can make it look more real, but as you zoom into that bevel the polygons become apparent..    But by subdividing as you zoom in the renderer automagically generates more and more polygons.. so it always looks smooth..  That's a win for me.\n\nSimply put, it looks more \"real\"..  This has been a trail let me tell you, but now that I understand the concept I'll be doing all my models this way I think.. The results just look a lot better..\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2009/05/leman-russ-07.jpg\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"Leman Russ 07\" src=\"/images/2009/05/leman-russ-07-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Leman Russ 07\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Leman Russ 07</span></a>\n\n+3 hours -- Okay I have finished completely subdividing the hull of the tank and then went on to build the front little window hatch also using subdivison and subpatches.. It will take some getting used to but I can really see the power of doing things this way..\n\nNow that I am not fixing parts of the model I had already created, I can now go on to actually continue creating stuff..  Next I plan to make the front turret..  Fun stuff!\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2009/05/leman-russ-08.jpg\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Leman Russ 08\" src=\"/images/2009/05/leman-russ-08-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Leman Russ 08\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Leman Russ 08</span></a>\n\n+4 hours -- I have added the nose cannon as well as making some modifications to the sponsons bolter..  The new gun is completely subdivided and looks pretty good.  It looks like its too big to me but all my measurements assure me it's the right size..   Maybe it wont look so out of place once I get the top turret in place.\n\nThere is a lot of stuff going on in the back of the tank that I have yet to even start on.. I'll probably start tackling that next.\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2009/06/leman-russ-09.jpg\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"Leman Russ 09\" src=\"/images/2009/06/leman-russ-09-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Leman Russ 09\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Leman Russ 09</span></a>\n\n+2 hours -- I have been putzing around with several things for this update..   Firstly you'll note a color change in my render.. heh I was goofing off with the light and environment settings to see what I could come up with..   I'll probably keep playing with that so .. expect some differences..\n\nFurther, I roughed out the top turret housing and started working on that.. It doesn't look to scale to me.. it looks small, but all my measurements say its correct..  *shrug*   I have also started adding detail to the rear of the vehicle.. Lots of work to do there..  I'm gonna begin on hatches and things first..\n\nI have also been designing and pondering a couple animations with this and other 40k elements.. One of them deals with a drop pod which I need to model..\n","collection":"posts","url":"/40k-leman-russ/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2009-05-19-40k-leman-russ.md","collection":"posts","url":"/40k-leman-russ/","path":"_posts/2009-05-19-40k-leman-russ.md","id":"/40k-leman-russ","draft":false,"categories":["Hobbies"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"40k Leman Russ","layout":"post","tags":["Warhammer"],"image":"/images/2009/05/leman-russ-08.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-05-19 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"40k-leman-russ","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2009-06-07-ork-dip-the-10-minute-paint-job.md","content":"<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2009/06/10minork.jpg\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Ork Dip -- Almost done\" src=\"/images/2009/06/orkdip-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Ork Dip -- Almost done\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Ork Dip -- Click me!</span></a>\n\nSo I am going to be entering in a 40k tournament in August.  I'll be entering as an Ork player and have been tuning and playing various lists in preparation..   I have a lot left to do though..  I also have a lot of painting to do because one of the requirements is that you have a fully painted army.  It doesn't have to be professionally painted but it does have to look generally good, and have more than 3 colors on the model.\n\nThat's fine, except I have a LOT of models to paint and I generally take far too long to paint them.  I can spend 2 hours painting a single dude, and considering I have over 100 dudes (not counting vehicles)  yet to paint.. I have a daunting task ahead of me..\n\nI told my friends that there would be no way in hell I could paint all 100+ models in the time left.. It's just not possible..  That's when my buddy got after me to use the \"dip\" method of painting..  It's fast and easy, and you don't have to \"color in the lines\"..\n\nSo tonight I gave it a try..\n\n\nI knew that if I were going to have full 2000 point 40k Ork army ready for this tourney I'd have to paint each model in about 10 minutes, so that's what I did..  I gave myself 10 minutes to paint the model.  Period.   (Not counting the spray prime dry time or dip dry time.)\n\nI went to the store and got some light tan colored spray paint that I'd use as my primer/base coat.   It's pretty light in color but I knew the dip/stain would make it darker so that's what I went with..\n\n__0:30__ -- I came home and randomly selected one Ork not knowing if this would work worth a damn.   I took all of 30 seconds or so to prime the model with the spray paint then let it dry.  It took about 30 minutes to fully dry because I got the spray can nozzle a tad too close..\n\nI then went inside to prepare my painting area.. I selected the 5 colors I was going to use, Boltgun metal, Catachan Green, Fortress Grey, Brazen Brass, and Calthan Brown and then got my water, paper towels and brushes ready.\n\n__9:30__ -- Once the primer was dry I sat down and hit the stop watch.   I then took 9 minutes to paint the arms green, the helm and gun boltgun metal, some bitz got a bit of brown and some others got some grey while his shoulder piece got brass..   I was going to do some more brown and grey but the clock hit 9 and I put the brush down.\n\nThere is more I wanted to do, but I stopped at 9 minutes.\n\n__10:00__ -- I picked up the model and walked out to the garage where I already had the can of minwax stain open and ready to receive..   I used a pair of vice grips to dip the model all the way to the base in the stuff and let it sit in there for about 5 seconds..\n\nI pulled it out and shook it off as hard as I could into the trash can making sure it got all the drips..\n\nThat's it.. Done.  You see the results above.  It takes about 6 hours to get to the point where you can handle the model, and then a full 12 hours to make it so it's not tacky (or so I'm told.. I haven't passed the 12 hour mark)..\n\nA couple things yet to do is to spray paint a matte or satin varnish to dull some of that shine, paint the base black again (Should have done this prior to gluing to base.. lesson learned), and finally flock the base..\n\nIt's not perfect by any stretch but as a 10 minute paint job it's not half bad.   I'm going to refine my process and paint like 10 at a time to speed things up but this is definately my process.. here it is.. this is how I'm doing it..\n\nI'll post more pictures once I get more.   I'll also post a left and right comparison of a model I actually took 2 hours painting versus one that is dipped just to see..\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2009/06/30minloota.jpg\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"30 Minute Loota\" src=\"/images/2009/06/30minloota-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"30 Minute Loota\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>30 Minute Loota</span></a>\n\n__Additional:__\n\nSo after some game play I decided I needed some Loota's in my army.  Here is one I painted using my new method.. It takes a bit longer in total due to all the bitz that are there to paint.   So probably 30 minutes total went into this one.  I haven't flocked the base or matted the model yet so its a tad shiney still..  Either way this method works very well here too..\n","collection":"posts","url":"/ork-dip-the-10-minute-paint-job/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2009-08-03-wowvswar.md","collection":"posts","url":"/wowvswar/","path":"_posts/2009-08-03-wowvswar.md","id":"/wowvswar","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"WoWvsWar","layout":"post","tags":["Warhammer"],"image":"/images/2009/08/wowvswar.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-08-03 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"wowvswar","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2009-06-07-ork-dip-the-10-minute-paint-job.md","excerpt":"So I am going to be entering in a 40k tournament in August.  I'll be entering as an Ork player and have been tuning and playing various lists in preparation..   I have a lot left to do though.. ","id":"/ork-dip-the-10-minute-paint-job","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Ork Dip!

I was going to do some more brown and grey but the clock hit 9 and I put the brush down.\n\nThere is more I wanted to do, but I stopped at 9 minutes.\n\n__10:00__ -- I picked up the model and walked out to the garage where I already had the can of minwax stain open and ready to receive..

Done.  You see the results above.  It takes about 6 hours to get to the point where you can handle the model, and then a full 12 hours to make it so it's not tacky (or so I'm told..

I have a daunting task ahead of me..\n\nI told my friends that there would be no way in hell I could paint all 100+ models in the time left.. It's just not possible..  That's when my buddy got after me to use the \"dip\" method of painting..  It's fast and easy, and you don't have to \"color in the lines\"..\n\nSo tonight I gave it a try..\n\n\nI knew that if I were going to have full 2000 point 40k Ork army ready for this tourney I'd have to paint each model in about 10 minutes, so that's what I did..  I gave myself 10 minutes to paint the model.  Period.   (Not counting the spray prime dry time or dip dry time.)\n\nI went to the store and got some light tan colored spray paint that I'd use as my primer/base coat.   It's pretty light in color but I knew the dip/stain would make it darker so that's what I went with..\n\n__0:30__ -- I came home and randomly selected one Ork not knowing if this would work worth a damn.   I took all of 30 seconds or so to prime the model with the spray paint then let it dry.  It took about 30 minutes to fully dry because I got the spray can nozzle a tad too close..\n\nI then went inside to prepare my painting area.. I selected the 5 colors I was going to use, Boltgun metal, Catachan Green, Fortress Grey, Brazen Brass, and Calthan Brown and then got my water, paper towels and brushes ready.\n\n__9:30__ -- Once the primer was dry I sat down and hit the stop watch.

Their only other game of note is Dark Age of Camelot which was a one trick pony (realm versus realm combat) that has no long term play associated with it..   And while the game is still around, it's just not fun.  There is nothing there to keep players like me playing the game.. I just don't enjoy it nor does it have the massive fan base that it could have if they had bothered to keep innovating.\n\nWoW on the other hand has gobs and gobs of things to do long term as well as lots of mindless achievements and other end game elements to keep players attention.  They are adding new content and new fun things to the game all the time and this is from a guy who really doesn't like WoW..\n\nWhen it comes to long term play, WoW is the clear winner.  I play it still today and have for a while now.   My guild has killed the end game boss (Yogg) many times at this point and is starting to work on getting to the next guy..\n\nI'm playing WAR too at this point, but it's just not that fun and my interest is waning.. As I played WAR originally (and as I am relearning more recently), I realize it is exactly the same game as DAoC just in a slightly different universe.  It suffers the same issues that DAoC did and really brings very little new to the table..\n\nWhat WAR does wrong:\n\n*  The PVE aspects of the game are absolutely horrible..  The questing is painfully linear and just about always forces you to venture into PVP areas even if you don't want to.\n* The zone's are confusing and poorly laid out which makes navigation with out the flight system near impossible.\n* The flight mechanic from zone to zone is long loading and lame -- considering that you must use it, it needs an overhaul.\n* The models are pretty bad, but the animations are down right dreadful...\n* I can go on and on but will leave it be as otherwise this list will be too long...\n\nWhat WAR does right:\n\nPQ's, SC's and PVP.\n\nThe public quest system is neat and I wouldn't be surprised if blizzard \"adopts\" such a system in the near future..  It's well thought out and works quite nicely.   This I think is likely to be the single innovation that folks will remember WAR for in several years..\n\nSo far the majority of the scenarios (SC's.. Think battlegrounds for you WoW players) are a lot of fun.  Again way more so than any of the BG's in WoW which I find to be tedious and boring.\n\nDAoC's big plus was the Realm versus Realm thing.. Mythic of course followed that same model in producing WAR and as such their PVP model is excellent.  The realm versus realm thing is a lot of fun.. for a while.. it becomes tedious and boring fairly quickly, but still the PVP is very good.\n\nThe PVP in WAR is far far far better than what is offered by WoW.   Period.  Full stop.\n\nThe reason for that is how the classes are balanced as well as the fact that blocking is turned on.   In WoW it's perfectly reasonable for a frail clothy to stand toe to toe with a fella in full plate and win.  Generally in WoW PVP any one class well played, can defeat any one other class..  What's the point?\n\nIn War, this is unreasonable and usually punished harshly.   As a bright wizard (weak clothy) I know that if a tank (guy in plate) charges me I have only a few seconds to react before death.. I better make them count!  Each class in the game has a specific function and is only really good at that function!\n\nWith blocking turned on (collision detection) the tanks can stand in front of the more frail classes and prevent them from being slaughtered..\n\nThe only place that this fails WAR is you have a lot of WoW players playing WAR who don't realize their place and as such just charge in and die, or refuse to block, or simply wont heal..etc.    I can't fault War for the players being stupid..\n\nThe problem here is that the game somewhat encourages players to play stupidly in that even if they don't work together in a SC the losing team still gets' a lot of experience for it.. but that's an aside.. again I really can't fault Mythic for morons..\n\nWhat I can do though is fault Mythic for producing a game that is so completely unrefined.  There are so many little things about War that is a complete fail..\n\nThe Macro system is bad.. The map system sucks.. The models are lame.. The animations are really bad.. The PVE content is tedious.. Some of the classes seem out of balance.. The crafting system is horrible and pointless.. etc..   It's just not that fun of a game and a lot of that is due to these little things..\n\nLet me be perfectly clear.  I don't like World of Warcraft.  I don't enjoy the universe at all, the stylistic game play, the mindless grinding, the life sucking raiding..etc..    I play it solely because my wife enjoys it..  Fine I'll play for her..  But I don't really like it.   I do however have to say that Blizzard has made a good game.   It's very refined in that stuff works.  It has it's own problems too.. (the inability to launch more dungeon instances is a big one.. )   But over all WoW is a good game.\n\nMythic with WAR however isn't all that good.  It really seems like they doggedly stuck to their one trick (realm vs realm) in the hopes that it would make a WoW Killer and not bother to innovate.  Okay fine, PQ's.. but that's ONE thing..   And of course just as DAoC's one trick failed to make the game a success, the exact same trick on WAR also failed..\n\nThe real issue I have is, it's been a year..  the game has done nothing in that time and at this point it doesn't look like its going to do anything..  If they don't care enough to fix their game, or innovate and make it better.. then I don't care enough to play it..\n\nCan't fix stupid.\n","collection":"posts","url":"/wowvswar/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2009-08-03-wowvswar.md","collection":"posts","url":"/wowvswar/","path":"_posts/2009-08-03-wowvswar.md","id":"/wowvswar","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"WoWvsWar","layout":"post","tags":["Warhammer"],"image":"/images/2009/08/wowvswar.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-08-03 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"wowvswar","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2009-08-06-offensive-footwear.md","content":"<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2009/08/feets.png\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Offensive Footwear\" src=\"/images/2009/08/feets-150x150.png\" alt=\"Offensive Footwear\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Offensive Footwear</span></a>\n\nSo a <a title=\"Scream of Consciousness\" href=\"http://gonzo.worlord.com\" target=\"_blank\">co-worker of mine</a> showed up wearing what, at the time, I could only describe as \"glove shoes\".  They are sort of like water socks, where each toe has its own sleeve to fit in.  They looked quite comfy and interested me..  I talked to him about it a bit and finally decided, what the heck.. I want a pair!\n\nI went to <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/stores/32\" target=\"_blank\">REI Austin</a> and tried on a couple pairs before settling on one..  They are great!  At first my toes rebelled at fitting into their own slot, but once I convinced them that I actually did want them in there all was well..\n\nIt's sort of feels like wearing a silk glove that had the bottom dipped in rubber.. Extremely comfy to be honest..  I hate having something between my toes so I was a tad worried that I wouldn't like them due to that but these feel completely natural..\n\nThe primary issue I have with them is the down right hostile reaction I get from folks when I wear them..\n\nAt this point I have been called a \"frog man\", \"weirdo\" and a \"fag\".   Can you believe that?  Someone actually was so offended by my footwear that they called me a fag... Really?   And that was three different people btw.. not just one..  Most people that seem them have a reaction, and not always a friendly one..  Everyone has to comment.. \"Nice footwear!\", \"What the hell are your wearing?!\".. etc..\n\nIt boggles the mind..   Flip-flops / Showershoes are all the rage and if you stop at any social gathering and look around someones wearing them..  Toes completely exposed.. That's normal and acceptable.. but my version of the same exact thing where the toes are covered is completely foreign  to the point of being offensive to some folks.\n\nThey are so \"weird\" that they jar that person's whole reality..  Even though they have toes too!  People are odd..\n\nI will say that I kind of feel like I'm actually using my toes to walk with for the first time..  These things are super grippy and when I walk in them, my toes are actually apart of the process..  Where as previously, in a closed mono-toe shoe your toes don't do much..\n\nIn these your toes are busy doing what they were always meant to do and as such, I have some sore muscles in my legs..  As Gonzo put it, it's sort of like the matrix..   \"Why do my toes hurt?  Because you've never used them before.. \" hehe  And he's right!  Nothing hurts.. let me be clear these are awesome.. but I can tell that some muscles are just now starting to be used..\n\nEither way I highly recommend them..\n","collection":"posts","url":"/offensive-footwear/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2009-08-12-game-review-champions-online.md","collection":"posts","url":"/game-review-champions-online/","path":"_posts/2009-08-12-game-review-champions-online.md","id":"/game-review-champions-online","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Game Review: Champions Online","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2009/08/defender1-champ-online-415-150x150.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-08-12 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"game-review-champions-online","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2009-08-06-offensive-footwear.md","excerpt":"So a co-worker of mine showed up wearing what, at the time, I could only describe as \"glove shoes\".  They are sort of like water socks, where each toe has its own sleeve to fit in.","id":"/offensive-footwear","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Offensive footwear!","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2009/08/feets-150x150.png","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-08-06 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"offensive-footwear","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2009-08-03-wowvswar.md","excerpt":"I love the Warhammer universe.  I have been an avid player of the various table top miniature games as well as the couple RPG games in the same universe.   So when Warhammer Online came out a year ago, I was stoked!","id":"/wowvswar","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"WoWvsWar","layout":"post","tags":["Warhammer"],"image":"/images/2009/08/wowvswar.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-08-03 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"wowvswar","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2009-06-07-ork-dip-the-10-minute-paint-job.md","excerpt":"So I am going to be entering in a 40k tournament in August.  I'll be entering as an Ork player and have been tuning and playing various lists in preparation..   I have a lot left to do though.. ","id":"/ork-dip-the-10-minute-paint-job","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Ork Dip!
