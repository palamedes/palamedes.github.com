And those same folks will tell you that not just any phone will do, I very much prefer a \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Converged_device\" target=\"_blank\">convergence device</a>.\"\n\n<img src=\"/images/2008/01/iphone.jpg\" alt=\"iPhone\" class='pull-right' />\n\nA single device that does a bunch of different stuff -- My very own \"tri-corder\" if you will.  I had been using a <a href=\"http://www.phonescoop.com/phones/phone.php?p=588\" target=\"_blank\">Sony Ericsson P910a</a> that for the most part I was happy with, but it had some limitations that annoyed me and kept me from really using it to it's full potential.  One of the big ones being the lack of Wi-Fi and the need for a stylus.  But I get ahead of myself;\n\nI had been seriously looking at a couple different phones to replace the 910..  I pretty much had the list down to two possible contenders; One was the <a href=\"http://www.phonescoop.com/phones/phone.php?p=1325\" target=\"_blank\">Nokia n95</a> and the other was <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/iphone/\" target=\"_blank\">Apple's iPhone</a>.  It was a close race..  And one the n95 was winning, right up until the Steve Jobs Keynote speech just a couple days ago.\n\nThe n95 looks like one heck of a nice device, but upon further review it suffers some of the same issues as the p910..  Firstly, it's clunky.   Its difficult to navigate and use the various tools because the interface relies on you using the little button pad which I found to be a royal pain in the ass.   And sure it has a very nice camera on it, but I'm buying a phone and convergence device.. not a camera.. but if you go line by line, the device has a lot of very nice features!\n\nThe iPhone looked like a nice device to be sure, but I wasn't sold on Apple.  I'm not exact what you would call an apple fan -- but I will admit that they make good hardware.  It's just I didn't want to be stuck with a device that was completely closed, with no ability to add new software.  When Steve Jobs annouced that they were releasing an SDK for the iPhone in his keynote speech the other day, it pretty much won the race for me.  Even so the phone does have issues.\n\nLets compare;\n<table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Compare Phones:</th>\n<th><img src=\"/images/2008/01/n95small.jpg\" alt=\"n95\" /></th>\n<th><img src=\"/images/2008/01/iphonesmall.jpg\" alt=\"iPhone\" /></th>\n<th><img src=\"/images/2008/01/p910small.jpg\" alt=\"p910a\" /></th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Phone</td>\n<td>\n<p align=\"center\">Nokia N95</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p align=\"center\">Apple iPhone</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p align=\"center\">SE P910a</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Required Carrier</td>\n<td>\n<p align=\"center\">__Any__</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p align=\"center\">AT&amp;T</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p align=\"center\">__Any__</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td colspan=\"3\">A lot of people have complained about the fact that the iPhone is basically an AT&amp;T only device. I don't mind simply because I had been using AT&amp;T anyway.

Not sure where the 16.7 days number comes from -- infact I think these numbers mean nothing. As it stands I sync my phone every night nearly so its just about always in its little stand on my desk.. so it gets charged every night. If I went on a long trip, I'd likely bring the charger.. And I don't think I've ever needed to make a cell phone call that lasted more than an hour or two..

It's ALL screen by its very design and let me tell ya coming from the little p910 screen to this thing.. Christ, it's HUGE!</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\nOther things:\n\n__GPS__ -- Everyone is gahgah about the fact that the Nokia N95 having a GPS antenna in it and bash the iPhone for not having one.  Yet those that have used it in the N95 have repeated stated that it takes forever to get a signal and sometimes doesn't work at all.    And while having a GPS locator sounds nifty and all, when was the last time you ACTUALLY NEEDED ONE?   Sure.. there was a time when I was in the Army in Korea stuck out in the middle of BFE when a GPS device would have been handy.. other than that, I can't see the use.   The iPhone can already give you a very accurate location using google maps, so adding GPS would be nearly pointless.    If you need GPS that much, you'd likely get an actual GPS device instead of hoping the one in your n95 was working that day.\n\n__Infrared__ -- Some people have complained that the iPhone doesn't have an infrared antenna.. and I must admit at first I was a little stunned that it didn't.  But then I realized, why would it?!  My SEp910 has one and in the years that I have carried that phone I have used that IR port, ONCE!  And that was just to see if I could.  Adding an IR port to the iPhone would have been a waste of space..\n\n__MMS__ -- A huge complaint of a lot of folks is the fact that the iPhone can't do MMS messaging.  I don't do MMS much.. I do SMS constantly, but not much MMS.  I'm sure with the SDK coming this will get fixed, but even if it doesn't.. I don't mind.  Most of my friends don't have phones that can even recieve a MMS, soooo...\n\n__FM Radio__ -- N95 supporters love to point out that the n95 has an FM Radio..  uh.. So?  Firstly, how often do you listen to the radio?   I personally don't.. Ever.  If I want to listen to music I use the built in music playing ability of the device.  And had I got the n95 I can assure you I would never turn the radio feature on.  I just don't like being pelted by the constant ad's they run on modern FM radio.  So this is another non-issue.\n\n__Camera__ -- Oh man.. the n95 people are absolutely drooling over the 5 megapixel camera and use it to cast disparaging remarks at the iPhone.  And yes, that's a very nice camera.  If you consider that I'm coming from a VGA camera to a 2 megapixel, I'm already taking a huge step up.  But most of all, I realize that this is first and foremost a phone, that can take pictures.  Not a camera, that has a phone.    A 2 megapixel camera is ample for me.  I just don't take that many pictures.. Now maybe that will change now that I have something better than the VGA camera.. We shall see.  Right now I'm just glad to have anything.\n\n__Video Capture__ -- lots of folks say the iPhone sucks because you can't record video with it.   Again.. Phone!  Not Video camera.  But, since it does have a camera I'm just sure with the SDK coming out someone will invent a video recorder soon enough.\n\netc.. etc.. etc..\n\nWhere the iPhone wins over all other phones, hands down?   The interface -- period.  The end.  The iPhone's interface is so intuitive and simple to use that I really see everyone else following suit.  Its a no brainer, and makes the device extremely attractive simply because of it's ease of use.   The only thing that really kept me from getting the iPhone previously was the closed proprietary nature of the device and Apple in general.  Now with the SDK in the offing, hell I'm sold.\n\nIt really is a very very nice device..  I'm shocked at how good it is to be completely honest, and I very much like it.   However, in the interest of being fair -- here are my complaints/wishes in no particular order;\n\n* Phone Volume -- This is my biggest complaint.  IT'S NOT LOUD ENOUGH!  Even the speaker phone isn't loud enough..  If I'm in a loud airport or in my truck driving, I can't hear the caller.  The speaker phone is down right bad.  The SE P910 was awesome for this in that, if you turned it all the way up you could hear it across the room while running a jackhammer.  heh..  I wish they'd let us turn that volume up higher, you let me worry about my hearing.\n* Greasy screen --  This is something I'm going to have to get used to.  But since you do everything with your finger and your touching glass, you end up with a very greasy screen that seems impossible to keep clean.  Or even remotely clean.  You only really notice it when you hold the phone just right, but when you do -- gah!  I'm not gonna touch that!\n* Yahoo Mail is buggy at best --  This is a disconnect between Yahoo and the iPhone.  Basically, as a long time yahoo customer I can receive my emails just fine through the phone, but if I try to send it errors out saying \"__The connection to the outgoing servers \"(null)\" failed__\" .. We think its a known issue that they are working on.  See, even apple has the occasional bug.. =p  (though I'm just sure they'd say it was Yahoo)  I'm sure this will get fixed.. too many folks are complaining.\n* iTunes is the devil --  I really don't like having to do everything through the iTunes interface.  Infact, I don't much care for iTunes in general.  I have had some issues with them in the past, and I don't care for them too much.  But what can ya do.   I want to be able to drag and drop my files to the iPhone directly without being forced through your interface.  Give me access to a directory.  Fix likely with the SDK coming.\n* No Copy &amp; Paste function -- I'm a little surprised at the lack of copy and paste.. It's a simple functionality, and it doesn't exist simply because there is no real way to do it via the touch screen.   I understand why.. but it would still be nice to have.   Maybe a \"touch and hold\" followed by a second finger \"tap\" puts you into the edit mode or gives you a hover menu that allows for additional functions?  I bet this will get addressed with the SDK.\n* Better USB support -- if I plug the iphone into a computer without iTunes installed, it should act as a harddrive.  Period.\n* Saving things to the phone in general -- I realize why its this way, but again I wish I could save an email attachment or dump a file to the device for transport.   This will likely come with the SDK.\n\nMore as I think of them.\n\nNote I didn't mention the lack of 3G... this is because you don't need it folks.. you usually will have Edge or Wi-Fi.\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2008-01-20-ubuntu-wine-and-world-of-warcraft.md","url":"/ubuntu-wine-and-world-of-warcraft/","relative_path":"_posts/2008-01-20-ubuntu-wine-and-world-of-warcraft.md","id":"/ubuntu-wine-and-world-of-warcraft","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings","Hobbies"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Ubuntu, Wine and World of Warcraft","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2008/01/ubuntulogo.png","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-01-20 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"ubuntu-wine-and-world-of-warcraft","ext":".md"},"url":"/iphone-its-not-all-hype/","relative_path":"_posts/2008-01-22-iphone-its-not-all-hype.md","id":"/iphone-its-not-all-hype","collection":"posts","excerpt":"As some of my close friends know, I have been shopping for a new cellphone for a while now.

All of my games are played in WindowsXP simply because there really is no other option... or is there?\n\nI have been using linux quite a lot at work, and really like where Ubuntu is going.  Pretty much everything about it leads me to think that Microsoft should be worried.  (Apple has nothing to fear, simply because they are a hardware company..)\n\n<img src=\"/images/2008/01/ubuntulogo.png\" alt=\"Ubuntu is awesome\" class='pull-right' />Anyway, after having XP tell me for the umpteenth time that I had \"unused icons on my desktop\"..  (Yes I know.. I PUT THEM THERE..)  I decided to install Ubuntu on my game machine and try to get WoW working.  I figured I'd be in a long and protracted fight, an impossible up hill battle with a colossal fight at the end!   I couldn't have been more wrong -- but I get ahead of myself.\n\nGetting Ubuntu installed on my game machine was cake.  I installed a new hard drive, partitioned it to have a /, a /home and a swap.. Installed Envy to get the nvidia drivers running.. and fiddled with the xorg.conf file for hours on end trying to get my dual monitors to work correctly.  That was the only part that was hard to be honest, I screwed it up a couple times.. heh.  That and I had to correct some oddity with the alsamixer being muted.. not sure what that was about.\n\n<img src=\"/images/2008/01/winehq_top_logo.png\" alt=\"WINE\" class='pull-left' />So with that, my game machine is now dual bootable into XP and Ubuntu.   Synergy works nicely on both installs which gets me to my email goofing off box (also ubuntu) and all the peripherals work nicely.. (er.. I haven't gotten the G15 keyboard stuff working in Ubuntu yet.. but haven't tried either)\n\nSo next, I installed WINE.  I really didn't know what to expect here, but was pleasantly surprised..  It's very simple, clean and works nicely.\n\nNext I dragged the World of Warcraft install off my XP C: partition into the .wine directory.. and typed \"wine Wow.exe\" via command line..\n\nAnd holy shit if World of Warcraft didn't launch first try!!  I was shocked and stunned beyond describing..  I mean I didn't expect it to work at all.. little alone the first damn try.\n\nNow the truth is, it didn't work fully the first try.  It got to the loading in screen, got to 100% and locked up.  But a couple of config file changes later (I had to enter 3 lines into the WTF config file) it worked and I played on it for several hours.\n\nWhat amuses me the most about this is that the game actually played in Linux at roughly the same frame rates as my windows XP box or HIGHER frame rates depending on what I was doing.\n\nI have no idea how they do it, but the WINE folks are awesome..Awesome I tell ya.  Wine you're the bomb!\n\nI don't know how it would handle a much more intense game.. Lets face it, World of Warcraft doesn't exactly push the envelope here..  So if I tried the same trick with say, Crysis... I doubt it would work.  But still I'm damn impressed.\n","previous":{"next":{"path":"_posts/2008-01-20-ubuntu-wine-and-world-of-warcraft.md","url":"/ubuntu-wine-and-world-of-warcraft/","relative_path":"_posts/2008-01-20-ubuntu-wine-and-world-of-warcraft.md","id":"/ubuntu-wine-and-world-of-warcraft","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings","Hobbies"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Ubuntu, Wine and World of Warcraft","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2008/01/ubuntulogo.png","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-01-20 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"ubuntu-wine-and-world-of-warcraft","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2008-01-18-my-kitty-babie.md","output":null,"content":"<a title=\"Babie and Me\" href=\"/images/2008/01/babieandme.jpg\" rel='lightbox' class='fancybox pull-right'><img src=\"/images/2008/01/babieandme-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Babie and Me\" align=\"right\" /></a>\n\nYesterday was a hard day.  Even now I get a lump in my throat thinking about it.  Yesterday my long time pet, companion and friend died.  She had been suffering for a while, and it was finally time to stop that suffering and let her rest.  A hard day indeed.\n\nShortly after I started working for C3 Communications in 2000, I was approached by a co-worker who was looking for a good home for a cat that she had recently adopted.   She was getting married and the new man in her life was \"allergic\" to cats.  The way she said it implied to me that he was just a jerk and was being mean to the cat, and she wanted to find another home for it -- instead of finding another man.\n\nI told her I was interested in the critter and was more than happy to take a look to see if we would get along.  Well, she had brought the cat that same day, and had it in the back seat of her car in a carrier.  Again, I got the impression it was me, or the pound.\n\nUpon seeing this scared little kitty in a cat carrier, all sad and dejected, I was more than happy to give her a good home.\n\nI took the rest of the day off and took her home.  She was completely silent the whole way home, looking this way and that not knowing what was going on, clearly terrified.\n\nWhen I got the carrier open she just sat in the back of it refusing to come out.  I knew better than to reach in and try to get her too.  I just let her sit there with the door open and spoke softly to her letting her know it was okay and she could come out whenever she wanted.\n\nEventually I just went about my business around the house.  I put some food and water down, and put the catbox where she could see them all.\n\nIt took several hours, but eventually she came out and disappeared under the bed. hehe   I honestly didn't see her for 2 weeks after that.  Every morning before going to work I would put some more catfood down, clean out the box and leave.  I'd come home and there'd be food missing so I knew she ate..  =)  She was very scared and clearly had a rough time in her previous home.\n\nThere was no way for me to make her understand clearly that I wasn't ever going to hurt her other than to let her adjust in her own time.\n\nShe eventually did of course, and we were pretty fast friends.  Eventually she was in my lap pretty much always demanding some lovin, which I was more than happy to provide.\n\nI don't know exactly when it happens, but at some point in our relationships with our pets they go from being \"Eh a cat\", to a very important member of our family, a loved one.   So of course it was very hard news to hear when I found out she was sick.\n\nShe was diagnosed with a hyperthyroid problem and given 6 months to live.  We kept her on the medication the doctors gave us and even purchased special expensive food to feed her which was supposed to help her get better.\n\nIt didn't.  In fact, nothing seemed to help.  She was wasting away before our eyes, getting sicker and sicker.   The final visit to the vet proved the medications and what not we had her own weren't doing anything and in fact the thyroid problem was an ancillary problem.\n\nBabie had some how contracted <a href=\"http://www.vet.cornell.edu/fhc/brochures/felv.html\" target=\"_blank\">feline leukemia</a>, an extremely nasty virus that is basically \"kitty HIV\".  I don't know where or how she got it as our cats never go outside.  But now we have to get the other two <a href=\"/my-cats-diary/\" target=\"_blank\">captives</a>.. er cats checked and make sure they are okay.   I seriously hope they don't have anything -- this sucked.\n\nBy the end, babie was hurting.  She was weak and unable to lift her head.  She had lost a ton of weight, and couldn't keep any food or water down.  She was having a very hard time breathing due to the leukemia and her liver had likely developed cancer.  Her body was failing her.  All around she wasn't her usual happy self, and it broke my heart.\n\nAt 2:45ish on Thursday Jan 17, 2008 she died.\n\nBabie was an awesome cat.  She was easily the best kitty friend I have ever had, and I will sorely miss her.\n\nShe was an extremely gentile soul, that just wanted to love and be loved by all those around her.  Very sweet animal that I will never forget.   Babie I love you very much, and I hope your life was a good one.  You'll be missed.\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2008-01-11-wow-i-hate-you.md","url":"/wow-i-hate-you/","relative_path":"_posts/2008-01-11-wow-i-hate-you.md","id":"/wow-i-hate-you","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Wow, I hate you!","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-01-11 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"wow-i-hate-you","ext":".md"},"url":"/my-kitty-babie/","relative_path":"_posts/2008-01-18-my-kitty-babie.md","id":"/my-kitty-babie","collection":"posts","excerpt":"Yesterday was a hard day.

Even now I get a lump in my throat thinking about it.  Yesterday my long time pet, companion and friend died.  She had been suffering for a while, and it was finally time to stop that suffering and let her rest.  A hard day indeed.\n\nShortly after I started working for C3 Communications in 2000, I was approached by a co-worker who was looking for a good home for a cat that she had recently adopted.   She was getting married and the new man in her life was \"allergic\" to cats.  The way she said it implied to me that he was just a jerk and was being mean to the cat, and she wanted to find another home for it -- instead of finding another man.\n\nI told her I was interested in the critter and was more than happy to take a look to see if we would get along.  Well, she had brought the cat that same day, and had it in the back seat of her car in a carrier.  Again, I got the impression it was me, or the pound.\n\nUpon seeing this scared little kitty in a cat carrier, all sad and dejected, I was more than happy to give her a good home.\n\nI took the rest of the day off and took her home.  She was completely silent the whole way home, looking this way and that not knowing what was going on, clearly terrified.\n\nWhen I got the carrier open she just sat in the back of it refusing to come out.  I knew better than to reach in and try to get her too.  I just let her sit there with the door open and spoke softly to her letting her know it was okay and she could come out whenever she wanted.\n\nEventually I just went about my business around the house.  I put some food and water down, and put the catbox where she could see them all.\n\nIt took several hours, but eventually she came out and disappeared under the bed. hehe   I honestly didn't see her for 2 weeks after that.  Every morning before going to work I would put some more catfood down, clean out the box and leave.  I'd come home and there'd be food missing so I knew she ate..  =)  She was very scared and clearly had a rough time in her previous home.\n\nThere was no way for me to make her understand clearly that I wasn't ever going to hurt her other than to let her adjust in her own time.\n\nShe eventually did of course, and we were pretty fast friends.  Eventually she was in my lap pretty much always demanding some lovin, which I was more than happy to provide.\n\nI don't know exactly when it happens, but at some point in our relationships with our pets they go from being \"Eh a cat\", to a very important member of our family, a loved one.   So of course it was very hard news to hear when I found out she was sick.\n\nShe was diagnosed with a hyperthyroid problem and given 6 months to live.  We kept her on the medication the doctors gave us and even purchased special expensive food to feed her which was supposed to help her get better.\n\nIt didn't.  In fact, nothing seemed to help.  She was wasting away before our eyes, getting sicker and sicker.   The final visit to the vet proved the medications and what not we had her own weren't doing anything and in fact the thyroid problem was an ancillary problem.\n\nBabie had some how contracted <a href=\"http://www.vet.cornell.edu/fhc/brochures/felv.html\" target=\"_blank\">feline leukemia</a>, an extremely nasty virus that is basically \"kitty HIV\".  I don't know where or how she got it as our cats never go outside.  But now we have to get the other two <a href=\"/my-cats-diary/\" target=\"_blank\">captives</a>.. er cats checked and make sure they are okay.   I seriously hope they don't have anything -- this sucked.\n\nBy the end, babie was hurting.  She was weak and unable to lift her head.

Okay I don't actually.. In fact, I think the game play is pretty good.  The social aspect is pretty good, the combat is pretty good, raiding can be fun, and it's a nice mindless game to play with your friends and loved ones..  In fact, just about everything is pretty good.\n\nExcept one major detail -- the game looks like ass.\n\nBut I get ahead of myself.  I have played <a href=\"/past-mmos-i-have-played/\">MMO games for a long time</a>, so I have a pretty darn good idea of what a good game is.  And just about across the board, World of Warcraft (WoW) has done some very nice things.  I think blizzard did a great job in capturing everything that makes a game fun to play.   Since my wife has decided to play the game again, that meant I was going to have to play the game too.. (I swear Scott Kurtz has a <a href=\"http://www.pvponline.com/2008/01/08/wow-frau/\">camera in my house</a>..)\n\nNow there are a lot of people (especially in EVE) that hate WoW just because they need something to hate.  They hate everything about it, and when you complain that they are doing something stupid they will tell you to; \"Go back to Wow!\"  Or some such rubbish..  These people are the opposite of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fanboy\" target=\"_blank\">fanboi's</a> in that they hate WoW with a fervor and passion unparalleled (and unexplained.)  I'm not one of those folks.\n\nFor some reason, however, I have never liked WoW and up until very recently I didn't know why.   I thought the reason was due to the stylistic game play (read: the cartoony nature.)  But since I love TFC2 that can't be the reason -- It's all cartoony.  But finally, after much thought and reasoning I have come to the real culprit.\n\nThe game just looks terrible.  It's extremely low-poly and frankly, unimpressive.  I am not one that usually puts graphics before gameplay, but they have the game play.. Now fix the graphics!  Wheels should have more than 5 sides..  I mean seriously, this game looks like it was put together with lego blocks.\n\nI realize its an older game, but so is EVE and they are constantly working on their graphics.. (<a href=\"http://www.eve-online.com/trinity/index.html\">Trinity</a> = good!)\n\nIt really needs an overhaul.  At this point it looks extremely dated -- sorta like looking at EQ1 now compared to EQ2 or any other game for that matter.  WoW is of the EQ1 generation.  It's time for an upgrade.\n\nI realize the game was designed with the lowest common denominator in mind with regards to hardware -- and maybe that's smart and the reason its as popular as it is.. but I personally don't like it.\n\nEspecially considering my game rig.. I have a game machine that can play Crysis at 1680x1050 with ALL the settings maxed and still get 20+ fps.  (Try it some time.. If you get more than 10 fps you're doing good -- I still prefer to turn stuff off and play it at lower settings.. anything lower than 40 fps seems laggy to me..)  So it seems wasteful to play WoW with all that hardware.. heh..\n\nSo that's it.. That's my big problem with the game.. It's too low-poly at this day an age.  It just seems klunky.  And I'm not keen on the klunk.\n","previous":{"next":{"path":"_posts/2008-01-11-wow-i-hate-you.md","url":"/wow-i-hate-you/","relative_path":"_posts/2008-01-11-wow-i-hate-you.md","id":"/wow-i-hate-you","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Wow, I hate you!","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-01-11 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"wow-i-hate-you","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2008-01-07-eve-being-bad-and-tools.md","output":null,"content":"So as some of you know I have been playing the hell out of Eve..  I am really enjoying the game and things are going nicely.   I have created a baby combat alt on a second account that I use to PVP and generally misbehave and I'm enjoying it very much.  And I mean I've been really bad.. heh I have done everything from gate camping to ore stealing, which is generally something I don't think of very highly. But its actually quite a lot of fun..\n\nMy goal was not to grief or be a jerk, but rather to learn what can be done and the best way to go about it.  That way when someone is doing it to me, I know.  The irony of it so far is, I am enjoying it quite a lot.  Probably more than I should to be honest.  My main has very expensive ships and implants that I don't want to risk, plus he is entirely skilled towards industry and production.  When I created the new alt, I said that I would never fear risking him.  If he dies.. so be it.  No big deal.\n\nThat different mindset has really opened my eyes to the game and brought about a lot of enjoyment.  So any advice I would give at this point is don't fear dying.  Fuck it..  Death means nothing, its part of the game.  If you keep that in mind you'll have a lot more fun!  And engaging people you have no business engaging can actually be quite a lot of fun, and you might surprise yourself.  I was able to take out a number of larger ships with a little T1 Frigate.. I was stunned.  Much of that might be my knowledge as a player versus the knowledge of my target but still.  A frigate can take out a cruiser.. It might take a while, but you can do it.  (I dunno about a BS though, probably cant out dps the recharge amounts)\n\nI find that playing this part of the game has really forced me to pay close attention to what all those little numbers mean when you look at any bit of equipment.  Suddenly signature radii and transversal velocity is very important.. hehe\n\nI also find it amusing that my baby combat alt makes money hand over fist through missions and PVP'ing alone.  (I love having sold someones gear back to them after I pop'd their ship.. heh)  Where as my main does nothing but mining and industry related activities, and probably doesn't do as well in the long run.  He makes money too, but there is a lot more work involved in mining and producing items versus just killing things and doing missions.   In the grand scheme of things my main has a lot more money, but the new character seems to be making it faster.. this may just be due to my playing it more.\n\nIts also nice having two fully rigged out battlecruisers and higher to do missions, versus only one.  Here soon, my \"baby combat alt\" wont be so baby like any more and will actually fit a larger ship than my main.. which is fine by me!   My main will happily stay in his T2 Fitted Drake and stand off launching missiles.. =)\n\nEither way I'm having a lot of fun... To that end, I have started creating tools that I find useful that will work both in-game in the mini-browser and out of game in a browser with no loss of functionality.  This means no javascript what so ever -- ouch.\n\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2007-11-05-games-should-be-fun.md","url":"/games-should-be-fun/","relative_path":"_posts/2007-11-05-games-should-be-fun.md","id":"/games-should-be-fun","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Games","Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Games should be fun","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2007-11-05 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"games-should-be-fun","ext":".md"},"url":"/eve-being-bad-and-tools/","relative_path":"_posts/2008-01-07-eve-being-bad-and-tools.md","id":"/eve-being-bad-and-tools","collection":"posts","excerpt":"So as some of you know I have been playing the hell out of Eve..
