Primarily because back then they were as damaging and deadly to themselves as they were to anyone else..\n\nLater revisions of the Skaven codex very much removed a good portion of the wild and whacky from the army entirely and they sort of became boring.. I stuck with them through all these years but eventually ventured into Tomb Kings just to try something new..  Well with the new Skaven, I'm back baby..\n\nAnd my opponents are doomed!\n\nOr, well I might be doomed.. It all depends on the dice I suppose..   Either way it promises to be fun!\n\nI really like where they are going with the army.. I mean I know the army is bound to be more powerful than the current armies are simply because it's the latest army..   That's just the way of things.. Games Workshop is a company in the business to make money and the way to do that is to make the lastest revision just a smidge better than previous ones so folks will flock to it.. But having said that, I like that they army is back to being quite self destructive..\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2009/11/doomwheel1.jpg\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"New Doomwheel\" src=\"/images/2009/11/doomwheel1-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"New Doomwheel\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>New Doomwheel</span></a>\n\nFirstly, they have added the doomwheel back to the roster.. Something they completely omitted from the last book entirely.. Not only did they bring it back in the new book but they released a new model for it and its great!\n\nI still have my old doomwheel model on the shelf where its sat for the last 10 years or so not getting played.. and when I read that the new book would have a doomwheel I blew off the dust getting it ready for play..  Then I saw the new model.. Holy crap.. Yeah okay.. back on the shelf you go.. I'm getting the new on and painting it.. (See image)\n\nPlus it's all plastic!  Yay!\n\nI remember the day when the metal models were all way more detailed than anything they could come up with in plastic, but those days are long gone.. Give me plastic all the way..  Well it appears GW has heard our pleas and is intending to release all new models for the Skaven..   They have already put out a number of them, with a few more in the wings to come out.\n\nPlus the codex has a bunch of new units that they will have to produce models for sooner or later so I expect even more..\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2009/11/stormvermin01.jpg\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Stormvermin Before and After\" src=\"/images/2009/11/stormvermin01-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Stormvermin Before and After\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Stormvermin Before and After</span></a>\n\nThe new stormvermin plastic kit is fantastic.. Gone are the days of having to purchase a buttload of individually packed blisters at$15 each just to have a 20 model unit.. The new stormvermin box comes with everything you need to have a fully functional unit of 20 models..\n\nThey paint up nicely and the dip method works perfectly on Skaven.  Click the before and after picture to see what I'm talking about.  That model was painted in about 15 minutes.. I did what I can only call a slap/dash job of painting him with basic colors and then performed the magical \"dip\" at which point he came out looking great.\n\nAdd to the mix the WAY over the top new characters and warmachines and you have one powerful army..  I look forward to building a force to play with..  The only down side is it looks like I will have to repurpose all my old models as they aren't what I would build now..  The up side is, I now have more slaves than I know what to do with..\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2009-11-14-game-review-dragon-age-origins.md","url":"/game-review-dragon-age-origins/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-11-14-game-review-dragon-age-origins.md","id":"/game-review-dragon-age-origins","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Game Review: Dragon Age - Origins","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2009/11/dragonageoriginslogo.png","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-11-14 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"game-review-dragon-age-origins","ext":".md"},"url":"/games-workshop-warhammer-fantasy-the-new-skaven/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-11-15-games-workshop-warhammer-fantasy-the-new-skaven.md","id":"/games-workshop-warhammer-fantasy-the-new-skaven","collection":"posts","excerpt":"I have been a Skaven player since the early 1990's.  They were the second fantasy army I got into after Orcs &amp; Goblins.  Once I found the blessing of the horned rat however, my love of all things green didn't last very long..   The Skaven were here to stay!","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Games Workshop -- Warhammer Fantasy: The new Skaven","layout":"post","tags":["Warhammer"],"image":"/images/2009/11/skaven-head.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-11-15 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"games-workshop-warhammer-fantasy-the-new-skaven","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2009-11-14-game-review-dragon-age-origins.md","output":null,"content":"<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2009/11/dragonageoriginslogo.png\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Dragon Age Logo\" src=\"/images/2009/11/dragonageoriginslogo-150x150.png\" alt=\"dragonageoriginslogo\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Dragon Age Logo</span></a>\n\nI ask you -- can Bioware do no wrong?  Every game of theirs that I have played, I have loved.  Neverwinter Nights was kinda \"Feh\" but the concept was excellent even though the editor was horrible.   Mass Effect was fantastic forcing me to play it through like 4 times..  And of course the Baldur's Gate franchise was awesome.. I played that game until my eyes bled, sought healing and then played it some more..\n\nSo when Dragon Age was announced at E3 way back in 2004 I was stoked..  Finally a spiritual successor to Baldur's Gate done in a completely new style with modern graphics, fully voice acted and by the same developer.. *Gleeeee* I anticipated more costly eye healing.. As I was sure to play that game as much as I played Baldur's Gate..\n\nAnd then we waited.. and waited.. and waited..  Set the way forward machine now to 5 fricken years later... And FINALLY we have the game to play..\n\nAnd it's pure liquid awesome.. but I get ahead of myself..\n\nI have to admit I think most game companies release information about their games way too early.. Bioware is extremely guilty of this and they still haven't learned their lesson..  They released information about Neverwinter Nights way too early and it caused this massive hypefest that dwindled down to sarcastic jokes and disappointment by the time the game was finally released..  I don't know for sure but I am more than willing to put money on the fact that it hurt their sales..\n\nIt also hurt them that Neverwinter Nights just couldn't live up to type hype that was generated.. It was supposed to be a new kind of awesome, and it simply wasn't.   Dragon Age on the otherhand didn't get quite as much hype and it deserved it!  It's a really good game.. I mean.. it's stunningly good..  It's quite possibly one of the best games I have ever played, and let me tell ya -- that's saying something..\n\nFirstly, the game is beautiful.. Their engine is really coming along nicely and it serves the game extremely well..  Plus it's not a CPU hog.. I play the game at 1920x1200 on a dual monitor system at max graphics 8xAA and get a solid 60 frames per second.. (I have v-sync turned on)..\n\nSecondly, the entire game is voice acted.. and well too..  I like that.. suddenly you don't have to read tedious story lines for hours and hours just to get some concept of whats going on in the game..\n\nThirdly, the game is fricken huge!!  They say it has 200 hours of play time, but I think it's more.. I know I haven't played 200 hours yet, but I have done quite a bit and my character isn't 20% through the game yet .. (there is a stat that tells you how far you have gone).. Plus the way they have added downloadable content was clever so the game is forever expandable.. More over, when they announced the name change from \"Dragon Age\" to \"Dragon Age: Origins\" it sort of let us know that they have a lot of plans for this engine.  I anticipate quite a lot of new games / expansions to be released under the Dragon Age title..  But not only that, I am willing to bet that the new games (say for example the new Star Wars MMO) will use this engine too..\n\nFinally, the game has good re-playability.. This game is basically 6 games in one in that you can play through it six times and have six different experiences.. Each \"Origin\" gives you a whole new perspective on the game and its cool..\n\nI have a ton more I could talk about, like how the tactic system is cool and how the game can be played over the shoulder or isometric..etc.. But posting about this stuff is keeping me from actually playing the game and that just wont do..  Look.. go get the game.. this is one game that you must go get..\n","previous":{"next":{"path":"_posts/2009-11-14-game-review-dragon-age-origins.md","url":"/game-review-dragon-age-origins/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-11-14-game-review-dragon-age-origins.md","id":"/game-review-dragon-age-origins","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Game Review: Dragon Age - Origins","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2009/11/dragonageoriginslogo.png","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-11-14 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"game-review-dragon-age-origins","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2009-11-07-xperia-x10-my-next-phone.md","output":null,"content":"<a href=\"/images/2009/11/X10-overview-top.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"SE Xperia X10\" src=\"/images/2009/11/X10-overview-top-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"SE Xperia X10\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>SE Xperia X10</span></a>\n\nOn June 27th, 2007 (shortly after I got married) the iPhone came out.. I sort of waffled back and forth as to whether or not to get the iPhone or the N95..  The decision was very much made for me when they announced the SDK for the iPhone back in January of 2008, and I got one a day or two later..  I found out that the <a href=\"/iphone-its-not-all-hype/\" target=\"_self\">iPhone wasn't all hype</a> and that I seriously made the right choice.. The N95 is a good device but now that I have handled both, I can say that the iPhone was superior in the one way that mattered the most;  the interface.\n\nI continue to use just about all of the features of my iPhone on a daily basis and can honestly say it's one of the most useful tools I have ever owned..  I have loved this device.. When the <a href=\"/3g-iphone/\" target=\"_self\">3G iPhone</a> came out I briefly had some unfaithful thoughts and considered upgrading but to be honest I just didn't feel the improvements were enough to warrant the cost even though it was only $200..  I passed..   Then the 3Gs came out and again, I didn't see the advantage.. Sure a few extra go faster stripes, but just not that big of an improvement..  Pass again..\n\nWith each iteration of the OS, they continue to upgrade the first generation device in lock step with the later generations which I felt was a really good thing to do.  I personally believe that you should never, ever cripple your hardware through software.   If a device can do a thing, it should be allowed to do a thing..  And it appeared they weren't crippling their older device just so you would upgrade... Until it became apparent that they were doing just that..\n\nThe irony of course is that Apple is sort of known for doing exactly that and yet I still bought in..   The iPhone has been wonderful and will likely continue to be wonderful as a device, but the more I use it and the deeper I get into the user experience as well as the developers experience the more I realize that there are a lot of limitations in place.  Some of those were put there by Apple intentionally to get you to upgrade to the latest revision of the hardware..  And that's shitty..\n\nI recently purchased a very nice <a href=\"/hardware-review-sony-dr-bt21g-wireless-bluetooth-stereo-headset/\" target=\"_self\">bluetooth stereo headset</a> with the intention of using them with my phone..  However Apple has disabled the A2DP bluetooth profile on the first generation iPhone..  Just 'cause..   The phone certainly can do it, it's a software profile not a hardware difference but they decided do turn that feature off.   They also didn't enable MMS for the first generation iPhone even though I'm pretty sure we were promised that along with everyone else.. again that simply sucks..  Don't even get me started on the \"new\" voice activation shit the new 3Gs can do and that my p910a could do 5 years ago..   I can say that this sort of thing has made me pretty angry at Apple..\n\nI am also somewhat annoyed with AT&amp;T of late as their network is completely and totally hozed.  A buddy of mine that works for AT&amp;T said their network in the Austin area is something like 400% saturated and yet are forced (by the consumer) to continue to add new features like the recently added MMS stuff..  3G is great if the network actually has bandwidth..  When my phone first came out the Edge network (2G) worked fine.. sure it was a tad slow but it worked... NOW it doesn't work at all because they have throttled it down to nothing trying to eek out more 3G bandwidth to support the customer demand..   So while previously my wife with her 3G iPhone would load a webpage in 30 seconds that would take me a minute to load, now her phone can sometimes load it in a minute and mine times out every time.. So effectively my iPhone's network is gone.. (Depends largely on the time of day.. )\n\nI had told my wife that I was going to get the next version of the iPhone.. whatever came after the 3Gs.. I told her that the 3Gs was tempting but wasn't quite better enough to warrant the cost and that I normally hang on to a device for 2 or so years before upgrading anyway..  So whatever Apple came out with next would do me..  I assumed at the time I said this that Apple would continue to actually support my device in the form of upgrades..  Now I'm less sure of this..\n\nIn my mind they have intentionally crippled the first generation iPhone such that I can't use stereo bluetooth, MMS or the new Voice activation stuff even though the hardware supports it..   And that's shitty..  And all so I would rush out and purchase the latest hardware..  (Which I couldn't do anyway in the case of the 3G because I was contractually obligated to AT&amp;T..)\n\nSo.. Now I'm forced to consider alternatives..  Or rather not forced, but am shopping for alternatives because Apple &amp; AT&amp;T has pissed me off..  Their business tactics smack of greed and I just don't like that..\n\nAnd while my iPhone still very much works and for the most part still does everything I need, I would like to get a new phone simply for the newer abilities that are out there..   The problem was the iPhone (even the original one) set the bar extremely high..  The interface just wins.. The application store system works very nicely and is a huge win for both developers and customers alike..  The native applications all work extremely well, are user friendly and functional.. etc.. it's gonna be tough finding something that works as well and has the features and functionality of even my crippled phone..\n\n<img class=\"pull-right\" title=\"SEXperia\" src=\"/images/2009/11/SEXperia.jpg\" alt=\"SEXperia\" width=\"189\" height=\"348\" />Or so I thought..  I had looked into quite a few different devices, most of them were either the latest Symbian or Android style phones.. None of them really did what I wanted.. the form factor was just all wrong in most cases..  They had unnecessary things like slider keyboards or just uncomfortable shapes, or they weren't enough of a convergence device..\n\nThen a co-worker pointed out the <a href=\"http://www.sonyericsson.com/cws/products/mobilephones/overview/xperiax10a?lc=en&amp;cc=us\" target=\"_blank\">Xperia X10 by Sony Ericsson</a>.   Wow..  It's not out yet, but the <a href=\"http://www.sonyericsson.com/cws/products/mobilephones/specifications/xperiax10a?lc=en&amp;cc=us\" target=\"_blank\">specs are available online</a> and I must say I'm impressed..  I have a fairly high opinion of the SE line of devices.. The p910a was a great device for its day.. I really had zero complaints about it and think back on it fondly..\n\nIn my opinion, the quality of the iPhone where the physical device is concerned is pretty high.. It doesn't feel flimsy for easily breakable even though the whole front of it is glass.. It has a nice weight to it and it's comfortable to hold..  The only thing I don't like physically about the iPhone is the volume is really low by comparison to some of my other phones (the Nokia Communicator I owned was so loud I had to hold it away from my head..)\n\nI'm seriously hoping that the the Xperia phone matches the iPhone for physical quality..  If it does then it's a shoe in for my next device..  ALL of the spec's for this device beat my first generation iPhone by a landslide..  Plus it appears to have the same touch screen style interface and it's an \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_%28operating_system%29\" target=\"_blank\">Android</a>\" with 1ghz processor?!   Christ it's a phone that's more powerful than my first two IBM PCs combined..\n\nThe biggest complaint most folks have is that it doesn't have a keyboard..  Are you fucking kidding me?  I just don't understand that..  I used to think a keyboard would be nice until I had a device that had one and never used it..  Once I got used to the iPhone style of on screen keyboard I was done with physical keys..  Touch screen is where it's at folks..  Real keyboards in a device this size are simply not practical nor are they useful...\n\nThe real big complaint is that this phone will likely cost around $800... or more...\n\nEither way I think this phone is it.. It's still a ways out yet though.. it's slated to be released in \"the first half of 2010\" which knowing SE will be the very last day of that time frame or pushed back later.. heh\n\nI'm also not entirely sure about the UI code named \"Rachel\" by Sony Ericsson..\n\n*link removed*\n\nLooks good to me!  It's getting bashed by a lot of folks for some reason though.. I think it's very pretty and seems fully functional.. *shrug*  I dunno why people hate it so much.. I guess change is scary.. They may just want the row after row of icons and nothing else..\n\nThe other complaint is that it's being shipped with android 1.6 instead of 2.0 which people can't understand.. I think that decision has a lot to do with the development cycle.. The phone has likely been in development for a while now and its currently written on 1.6.. When does 2.0 come out?   They would have to completely rewrite to get 2.0 crammed in there at the last second before the phone was due to be released..  I think by writing it on 1.6 they get the software down pat and can then release the 2.0 version in a upgrade down the road..   Quality folks.. they want the OS to work the first time around..\n\nI can appreciate that..  I'd take a stable 1.6 over a buggy 2.0 package anyday..\n\nAnyway.. that's it.. This thing looks hot.. Here is another video of the music player and photo viewer.. Looks great..\n\n*link removed*\n\nI'll keep you posted.\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2009-11-02-hardware-review-sony-dr-bt21g-wireless-bluetooth-stereo-headset.md","url":"/hardware-review-sony-dr-bt21g-wireless-bluetooth-stereo-headset/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-11-02-hardware-review-sony-dr-bt21g-wireless-bluetooth-stereo-headset.md","id":"/hardware-review-sony-dr-bt21g-wireless-bluetooth-stereo-headset","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Hardware Review:  Sony DR-BT21G Wireless Bluetooth Stereo Headset","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2009/11/headphones.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-11-02 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"hardware-review-sony-dr-bt21g-wireless-bluetooth-stereo-headset","ext":".md"},"url":"/xperia-x10-my-next-phone/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-11-07-xperia-x10-my-next-phone.md","id":"/xperia-x10-my-next-phone","collection":"posts","excerpt":"On June 27th, 2007 (shortly after I got married) the iPhone came out..

I sort of waffled back and forth as to whether or not to get the iPhone or the N95..  The decision was very much made for me when they announced the SDK for the iPhone back in January of 2008, and I got one a day or two later..  I found out that the <a href=\"/iphone-its-not-all-hype/\" target=\"_self\">iPhone wasn't all hype</a> and that I seriously made the right choice.. The N95 is a good device but now that I have handled both, I can say that the iPhone was superior in the one way that mattered the most;  the interface.\n\nI continue to use just about all of the features of my iPhone on a daily basis and can honestly say it's one of the most useful tools I have ever owned..  I have loved this device.. When the <a href=\"/3g-iphone/\" target=\"_self\">3G iPhone</a> came out I briefly had some unfaithful thoughts and considered upgrading but to be honest I just didn't feel the improvements were enough to warrant the cost even though it was only $200..  I passed..   Then the 3Gs came out and again, I didn't see the advantage.. Sure a few extra go faster stripes, but just not that big of an improvement..  Pass again..\n\nWith each iteration of the OS, they continue to upgrade the first generation device in lock step with the later generations which I felt was a really good thing to do.  I personally believe that you should never, ever cripple your hardware through software.   If a device can do a thing, it should be allowed to do a thing..  And it appeared they weren't crippling their older device just so you would upgrade... Until it became apparent that they were doing just that..\n\nThe irony of course is that Apple is sort of known for doing exactly that and yet I still bought in..   The iPhone has been wonderful and will likely continue to be wonderful as a device, but the more I use it and the deeper I get into the user experience as well as the developers experience the more I realize that there are a lot of limitations in place.  Some of those were put there by Apple intentionally to get you to upgrade to the latest revision of the hardware..  And that's shitty..\n\nI recently purchased a very nice <a href=\"/hardware-review-sony-dr-bt21g-wireless-bluetooth-stereo-headset/\" target=\"_self\">bluetooth stereo headset</a> with the intention of using them with my phone..  However Apple has disabled the A2DP bluetooth profile on the first generation iPhone..  Just 'cause..   The phone certainly can do it, it's a software profile not a hardware difference but they decided do turn that feature off.   They also didn't enable MMS for the first generation iPhone even though I'm pretty sure we were promised that along with everyone else.. again that simply sucks..  Don't even get me started on the \"new\" voice activation shit the new 3Gs can do and that my p910a could do 5 years ago..   I can say that this sort of thing has made me pretty angry at Apple..\n\nI am also somewhat annoyed with AT&amp;T of late as their network is completely and totally hozed.  A buddy of mine that works for AT&amp;T said their network in the Austin area is something like 400% saturated and yet are forced (by the consumer) to continue to add new features like the recently added MMS stuff..  3G is great if the network actually has bandwidth..  When my phone first came out the Edge network (2G) worked fine.. sure it was a tad slow but it worked... NOW it doesn't work at all because they have throttled it down to nothing trying to eek out more 3G bandwidth to support the customer demand..   So while previously my wife with her 3G iPhone would load a webpage in 30 seconds that would take me a minute to load, now her phone can sometimes load it in a minute and mine times out every time.. So effectively my iPhone's network is gone.. (Depends largely on the time of day.. )\n\nI had told my wife that I was going to get the next version of the iPhone.. whatever came after the 3Gs.. I told her that the 3Gs was tempting but wasn't quite better enough to warrant the cost and that I normally hang on to a device for 2 or so years before upgrading anyway..  So whatever Apple came out with next would do me..  I assumed at the time I said this that Apple would continue to actually support my device in the form of upgrades..  Now I'm less sure of this..\n\nIn my mind they have intentionally crippled the first generation iPhone such that I can't use stereo bluetooth, MMS or the new Voice activation stuff even though the hardware supports it..   And that's shitty..  And all so I would rush out and purchase the latest hardware..  (Which I couldn't do anyway in the case of the 3G because I was contractually obligated to AT&amp;T..)\n\nSo.. Now I'm forced to consider alternatives..  Or rather not forced, but am shopping for alternatives because Apple &amp; AT&amp;T has pissed me off..  Their business tactics smack of greed and I just don't like that..\n\nAnd while my iPhone still very much works and for the most part still does everything I need, I would like to get a new phone simply for the newer abilities that are out there..   The problem was the iPhone (even the original one) set the bar extremely high..  The interface just wins..

I mean you either get mono with mic or stereo, but no stereo with mic?!\n\nThen it occurred to me that the only time I would use the mic would be with my phone (more on that in a second) or when talking in Vent. or Teamspeak... neither of which would use stereo anyway..  So stereo headphones AND a mic would be pointless..\n\nThe battery life seems good too.. The box says it's rated for 11 hours of either headphone or headset(+mic) use and 100 hours of standby time..  I can't talk to the standby time as I tend to charge things pretty often, but I believe the 11 hours of headphone time..  I have yet to actually run out of juice while using them so.. *shrug*\n\nAll in all I like them.. I think they were a good purchase and I would recommend them.. They are light and comfortable and fold up nicely when you want to store them..\n\nPairing is simple and works well, though I had an odd issue the first time I paired with my Mac.. For whatever reason I had to reboot my mac to get anything to work post pairing.. I think that was more due to the fact that my mac hadn't been rebooted in like 4 months hehe.. It was starting to act wonky and I have all manner of stuff running on there so this was likely me, not the headphones..   Also it appears that \"Teamspeex\" doesn't fully support these, though Ventrilo and everything else works perfectly.\n\nMy only real complaint about them is that they must have a wall charger instead of just a USB charger..  This is a really.. really minor complaint and I hesitate to even mention it..  I just thought it was odd that it had a wall charger instead of a computer one.. but it occurs that a lot of folks may never actually use this device with a PC, but rather entirely with a IPod like device or their phone..  At which point they are still near a computer..  *shrug* still its minor..\n\nThe other complaint I have has nothing to do with this device, but rather my iPhone.   I have the first generation iPhone and it can't suppport the A2DP connection required to listen to music.. Which pisses me off..   Not because it can't do it, but because it totally can do it and Apple has it turned off for the original phones in order to get you to upgrade to the newer iPhones.. (If you have a 3G or 3Gs it works fine)\n\nGood job Sony..\n","previous":{"next":{"path":"_posts/2009-11-02-hardware-review-sony-dr-bt21g-wireless-bluetooth-stereo-headset.md","url":"/hardware-review-sony-dr-bt21g-wireless-bluetooth-stereo-headset/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-11-02-hardware-review-sony-dr-bt21g-wireless-bluetooth-stereo-headset.md","id":"/hardware-review-sony-dr-bt21g-wireless-bluetooth-stereo-headset","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Hardware Review:  Sony DR-BT21G Wireless Bluetooth Stereo Headset","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2009/11/headphones.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-11-02 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"hardware-review-sony-dr-bt21g-wireless-bluetooth-stereo-headset","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2009-11-01-happy-halloween-2009.md","output":null,"content":"<a href=\"/images/2009/11/littleredridinghoodpluswolf.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Halloween Costumes\" src=\"/images/2009/11/littleredridinghoodpluswolf-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Halloween Costumes\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>\n\nThe annual Halloween bash that my friend and his wife put on was a success!   Every year my friend Calvin and his wife go NUTS with Halloween..  They dress the house up, have hordes of food for guests, skads of candy for the kids and even have smoke machines strategically placed to set the atmosphere..    I have to admit, I'm liking it..\n\nI was never a big fan of Halloween as a kid though.. I just didn't really get into it..   That's not to say I didn't like dressing up and looting all the neighbors for chocolaty goodness though..  It was just the holiday itself..  Just for whatever reason, I didn't get into it..\n\nI think that the main reason was because I didn't get the \"fun\" of the costumes..   It was something I did as a kid, but didn't really get the why of it..  As I have grown older I have thrown caution completely to the wind and will dress as anything..  I simply don't care about being embarrassed or looking silly..  Infact, I have come to the conclusion that that's the point!   One day a year you get to do whatever!! Have fun with it..\n\nThis year I told Melissa I wanted to do a couples theme.. Something we could do together that was fun.. (okay I insisted it be a couples theme, but she came up with the idea.. ) We looked for a while and settled on a Little Red Riding-hood / Big Bad Wolf  duo..   We searched the web and assembled the costume bits and I think it came out pretty nicely if I do say so myself..  (Click the image for a slightly larger view..)\n\nAt the party every year they have a raffle / vote for who had the best costume.. I have to say I thought Melissa was a shoe-in.. She won last year in her \"cave woman\" costume (Which I'm sure I have a picture of somewhere.. ) and her little red riding-hood getup was great! (read: HOT!  She's so pretty.. =)  I thought she was going to win again for sure..   Though Karens co-worker Janet was there in a Dorthy costume that looked awesome too.. Complete with a real live Toto dog... named Kujo! hahah  The dog was awesome..\n\nSo I was more than a little stunned by getting the most votes..  The \"Wolf in grandmothers clothing\" was a hit!   Yay me! heh  It was fun.. Everyone sat around chatting and playing rockband, eating and passing out candy to whomever haunted the door..  It was a good night..  We had a lot of fun..\n\nMaybe there's something to this Halloween thing.. =)    Now to start planning my costume for next year!\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2009-10-09-hardware-review-razer-mamba.md","url":"/hardware-review-razer-mamba/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-10-09-hardware-review-razer-mamba.md","id":"/hardware-review-razer-mamba","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!","RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Hardware Review: Razer Mamba -- What a piece of shit!","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2009/10/razer-mamba-150x150.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-10-09 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"hardware-review-razer-mamba","ext":".md"},"url":"/happy-halloween-2009/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-11-01-happy-halloween-2009.md","id":"/happy-halloween-2009","collection":"posts","excerpt":"The annual Halloween bash that my friend and his wife put on was a success!   Every year my friend Calvin and his wife go NUTS with Halloween.. ","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Happy Halloween 2009","layout":"post","tags":["Melissa"],"image":"/images/2009/11/littleredridinghoodpluswolf.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-11-01 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"happy-halloween-2009","ext":".md"},"url":"/hardware-review-sony-dr-bt21g-wireless-bluetooth-stereo-headset/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-11-02-hardware-review-sony-dr-bt21g-wireless-bluetooth-stereo-headset.md","id":"/hardware-review-sony-dr-bt21g-wireless-bluetooth-stereo-headset","collection":"posts","excerpt":"In 1994 Jaap Haartsen and Sven Mattisson has a stroke of genius when they invented the personal area networking (PAN) protocol known today as Bluetooth for Ericsson phones.   By the year 2000 it was pretty widely known that Bluetooth was something hot!","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Hardware Review:  Sony DR-BT21G Wireless Bluetooth Stereo Headset","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2009/11/headphones.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-11-02 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"hardware-review-sony-dr-bt21g-wireless-bluetooth-stereo-headset","ext":".md"},"url":"/xperia-x10-my-next-phone/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-11-07-xperia-x10-my-next-phone.md","id":"/xperia-x10-my-next-phone","collection":"posts","excerpt":"On June 27th, 2007 (shortly after I got married) the iPhone came out..
