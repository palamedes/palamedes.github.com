I mean flame one another and act complete assholes..    Oh goodie..\n\nSeriously whats the point of a chat system when people only use it to call one another \"noob\" or worse..  It's not used for actual game play, which is what it was clearly design for.. or even friendly chat..  But rather used to cast the most obnoxious slander and profane slurs at other people just to get a rise out of folks..\n\nMost of these children haven't had their nap yet for the day so they frustrated at the game and feel the need to lash out at their own team..\n\nToday I had one guy go off on me about how I was a noob and the worst player he had ever seen when I was ganked by 3 other players..  *shrug* I died.. it happens.. 3 people jumped me.. 3v1 is hard to pull off in LoL.. No big deal..    The same 3 people did it to him, and he was \"unlucky\"..  Oh I see.. so when I die it's cause I'm a noob.. when you die to the exact samething, you're just unlucky.. What a jackass..\n\nThis sort of behavior happens every game..  More over, I see people all the time actually demand that other players do what they say.. never mind how you want to have fun.. no you do what I say!!   Seriously?   How about you play your game, and I'll play mine..  Where do you get off demanding I play a certain way?  Who the hell do you think you are?\n\nThe question I have to the gamers out there that feel the need to show your ass is;  why do this?!  Why do you feel the need to bash and badmouth everyone?  Is your life so pathetic that you must put everyone else down in order to feel good about yourself?   Why do you think you're better than everyone else?  Why do you think you're opinion carries more weight or that you know better about everything than everyone else?\n\nIt really frustrates me because I was raised to be a good person and not treat other people like garbage..  I also believe you shouldn't say anything over the internet that you wouldn't say in person..   And lets be honest, the vast majority of these kids wont dare say this shit to someone in person because they know they'd be eating fist shortly there after..  That makes them a coward too..\n\nSo, now you're not only an asshat but a craven one at that..  Why can't you leave people alone?   Don't be like this.. it just makes you look bad..\n\nThe real sad statement is that a lot of kids these days use this obnoxious and profane behavior as \"good-natured banter\" when it's anything but..  Being intentionally harsh and rude to someone is never a good idea unless you have known that person long enough to know its okay and they know you're kidding.. It's certainly never okay to a complete stranger..\n\nBut then that's the issue.. Anonymity on the internet means everyone's a stranger.. More over, it means you're 100% anonymous and can say or do anything you want \"without repercussion\"..  The fact that most people choose to be a jerk as opposed to nice is a sign of our times, and a bad one..  I tend to think of it as the harbinger of our societies downfall that people go \"asshole\" before they go \"nice\"..\n\nMy father always told me that a true test of character is what you do when no one can stop you..  I have to think that kids that act this way fail this test completely..\n\nActing obnoxiously on the internet is not only rude, but it's a cowardly act and you're pathetic if you behave that way..   More over, you don't know everything and certainly don't have the whole picture, why not just do your thing and let other people do their thing..\n\nOr even better, try something new for once..  Be nice..\n","collection":"posts","url":"/i-hate-people/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2010-09-26-book-review-a-game-of-thrones.md","collection":"posts","url":"/book-review-a-game-of-thrones/","path":"_posts/2010-09-26-book-review-a-game-of-thrones.md","id":"/book-review-a-game-of-thrones","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Book Review: A Game of Thrones","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2010/09/30652075.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2010-09-26 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"book-review-a-game-of-thrones","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2010-09-15-i-hate-people.md","excerpt":"Acting obnoxiously on the internet is not only rude, but it's a cowardly act and you're pathetic if you behave that way..

Martin has done a masterful job of creating an extremely suspenseful story full of political intrigue, action and hard core drama.\n\nOriginally released back in 1997 I some how missed this story until now..  At this point, it includes 4 books and I'm part way through the second one.. So far it appears to be a fantastic continuation of the first book beginning exactly where the first book left off as if it were one long book.. Yay!   It's good.. It's damn good..  The authors voice and the depth of the characters make it so..\n\nI highly recommend it.  <a href=\"http://search.barnesandnoble.com/A-Game-of-Thrones/George-R-R-Martin/e/9780553573404/?itm=2&amp;USRI=game+of+thrones#TABS\" target=\"_blank\">Clickie to Barnes and Nobles</a>\n\nAt this point I have only one complaint, and that's the eReader version appears to have a lot of typos.. Some are quite jarring.. But you can easily ignore them.. Or if you get the paper/hard back you wont have this problem..\n\n5/5 from me.. Good work George..\n\nApparently they are making the series into an HBO special in 2011..  It better be good!\n","collection":"posts","url":"/book-review-a-game-of-thrones/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2010-09-26-book-review-a-game-of-thrones.md","collection":"posts","url":"/book-review-a-game-of-thrones/","path":"_posts/2010-09-26-book-review-a-game-of-thrones.md","id":"/book-review-a-game-of-thrones","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Book Review: A Game of Thrones","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2010/09/30652075.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2010-09-26 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"book-review-a-game-of-thrones","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2010-10-11-portal-2-looks-so-awesome.md","content":"<img title=\"Portal 2\" class='pull-right' src=\"/images/2010/10/Wallpaper01_iPhoneLockScreen-e1286852221988-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Portal 2\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" />\n\nSo I am a HUGE fan of Portal..

The simply truth is that one vote has no value and I can prove it to you;\n\nIf my vote is such a big deal I'll tell ya what, I'll sell you my vote.   I'm pretty sure I can get a mail ballot and send it to you so that you can vote as me..  You can vote for anything you want..  That's pretty cool right?  Suddenly you could double your voting potential!\n\nHow much is my vote worth to you?  How much money are you willing to send to me in order to get this \"precious commodity\"?   yeah I thought so..\n\nUltimately though, it's my right.  I served in the US Army and after words as a Police Officer to ensure your freedoms and mine.  I choose, to not choose.\n","collection":"posts","url":"/i-dont-vote/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2010-11-02-i-dont-vote.md","collection":"posts","url":"/i-dont-vote/","path":"_posts/2010-11-02-i-dont-vote.md","id":"/i-dont-vote","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"I don't vote...","layout":"post","tags":["Voting"],"image":"/images/2010/11/votingprocess.jpg","ribbon":null,"tile_size":"2x2","private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2010-11-02 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"i-dont-vote","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2010-11-05-game-review-star-wars-the-force-unleashed-2.md","content":"<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2010/11/tfu2_dated.jpg\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"FU2\" src=\"/images/2010/11/tfu2_dated-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"FU2\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>FU Again er 2... </span></a>\n\nI never played the first Force Unleashed game and I sorta regretted it as I knew several folks who said it was a pretty good game..  So I was really excited when they announced a Force Unleashed 2 for the PC.    I figured that I'd finally get to try what everyone was talking about..\n\nWell I've tried it..  What a piece of shit..  This is quite honestly the first game that has pissed me off in a long time..  And I mean absolutely barking at the computer, pissed off..\n\nSo lets give the pros;\n\nIt's beautiful..  The graphics engine that they have used is a very nice one and it does a really good job of immersing you into the Star Wars universe..\n\nPlus it's a console to PC port so the expected controls are pretty bad, but I have seen worse console ports in this department so I want to give them a thumbs up here.. Not great.. Certainly not as good as a native PC game, but not terribad.\n\nNow lets talk about the cons;\n\nThe camera system.  The gameplay.. The gameplay and uh.. the gameplay!!\n\nFirst lets talk about the camera system..   Whoever the asshat was that thought it was a good idea to decouple the camera system from the players perspective and force you to control the character from whatever fucked up camera angle they wanted to throw at you for any given instance, needs to be kicked in the balls while being garroted by a hairy sweaty man using a live eel..  And then shot.\n\nThe camera system makes this game nearly unplayable as you don't look in the direction you're going!!  No no you look in whatever direction either your mouse was looking at previously OR (and this is by far worse) whatever fixed camera position they want you in for that particular scene..\n\nIt makes controlling your character impossible.  This is something that does NOT translate well from a console game to a PC game.  It only serves to piss people off,  so stop it!\n\nBut that's not the worst part.  No no.\n\nThe worst part is the game play in which they decide every few minutes to throw a quicktime event at you..  For those of you that are unfamiliar with quick time events they go something like this.. PUSH E NOW!   Oh too late... You died.. Start over.\n\nThe next time it will be some other random control you have to do at exactly the right or you fail it!   Plus, the correct control request is displayed at various spots around the screen instead of in the same place..  So you never know whats coming, when.. or for how long..etc..\n\nThis shit made for crappy game play 20 years ago in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon%27s_Lair\" target=\"_blank\">Dragon's Lair</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Ace\" target=\"_blank\">Space Ace</a>, and it makes for crappy game play today..  It's cheap and easy for the programmers so that's why they do it.. Not because it's fun.. I can't understand how console gamers like this crap but clearly they do or they wouldn't do it..\n\nNow.. Combine those two issues and you begin to understand why I had to stop playing every few minutes to wipe the projectile scream-spittle off my monitor..\n\nYou can't see where you're going or what you're doing because you're stuck in their camera angle and you have to perform some bullshit quick time event that borders on the impossible..\n\nI got to the Gorgon scene (or whatever the big god of war style beasty is in the arena is called) tried it about 20 times and uninstalled the game.    It pissed me off bad enough trying to lock his arms in to the shackles but really pissed me off the next part where they throw an awkward camera angle at you followed by a fucked up quick time event and don't explain at all what you're supposed to do..Done.\n\nThis game is shit.  Lucas Arts should hang their head as it does nothing to foster good memories about the franchise, it's a painful game that isn't fun what so ever..\n\nI'll give it 1 star for being pretty and half a star for actually not doing a bad job converting the controls to PC.. but the gameplay and camera system sink it completely.\n","collection":"posts","url":"/game-review-star-wars-the-force-unleashed-2/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2010-11-13-game-review-call-of-duty-black-ops.md","collection":"posts","url":"/game-review-call-of-duty-black-ops/","path":"_posts/2010-11-13-game-review-call-of-duty-black-ops.md","id":"/game-review-call-of-duty-black-ops","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Game Review: Call of Duty Black Ops","layout":"post","tags":["Call of Duty","Review"],"image":"/images/2010/11/Black-Ops.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2010-11-13 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"game-review-call-of-duty-black-ops","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2010-11-05-game-review-star-wars-the-force-unleashed-2.md","excerpt":"I never played the first Force Unleashed game and I sorta regretted it as I knew several folks who said it was a pretty good game..  So I was really excited when they announced a Force Unleashed 2 for the PC...
