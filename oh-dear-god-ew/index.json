I played CoH for almost a year starting back in Feb. 2005 when it first came out.  I like to refer to it as MMO Lite.\n\nIt's a good game, and a good starter game for those who aren't really sure about the whole MMO scene.  It's very simple to play and enjoy, and doesn't bog you down with many of the more complex MMO aspects.  For new comers to the market, its perfect.   It's how I got my wife into MMO's and now I can't get her away from the computer.. heh  (\"I just have this one last quest to do..\"  \"Uh huh.. sure honey.. \"  heh)\n\nAfter a while I moved on to other games, but found myself reactivating my account from time to time to give it a try.  For a while I played my City of Villains character almost exclusively until it once again just tired and I moved on.\n\nWell I'm back at it.  They have added a lot of content and depth to the game that really is interesting.  Firstly its not like your more modern / typical MMO in that there aren't characters standing around with question marks over their head letting you know there is something to do.  Lets be honest here, World of Warcraft is a good game but its seriously \"dumbed down\" in that it almost holds your hand while it plays itself.\n\nCity of Heroes hearkens back to the days of EverQuest 1 whereby you didn't know if someone had a quest or something for you unless you talked to them.  Accomplishments were hidden from you, and thereby meant more to you when you actually accomplished it.\n\nDeath in CoH means something too compared to modern day MMO's.  CoH has debt!   Now I played Ultima Online and EverQuest 1 for years, so extremely painful death was the norm for me.  In UO each time some naked PK ran up and killed you, you lost EVERYTHING!  It sucked.  In EQ1 though they changed that a lot in that you just had to make a corpse run and lost exp.  But you didn't lose your stuff..   When CoH came out and they made it so you just got a little bit of debt, I was stunned.  They made death meaningless.\n\nHA!  Look at what modern games do.  In the most recent MMO, Age of Conan, death means absolutely nothing. You just get shot back to a respawn point.\n\nBut I get side tracked -- the CoH is a good game and I'm finding I really enjoy the new Rikti invasion stuff and I hope they will let us \"counter invade\" at some point.  It'd be really cool to go to the Rikit homeworld or whatever and attack them back!! (maybe you can do this already and I just havent gotten to that content.. I dunno)\n\nSomething else they have added to the game is a pretty thorough marketplace and crafting system.  I like that -- thats pretty darn cool.  Well, one of the tricks of old is to watch your prices on that market.  I mean I dont understand why players, in game after game, will put stuff on the market below what they could sell them to the merchant for!!\n\nI spent about 4 hours last night just running goods from the market to the local merchant to sell.  People would put stuff on the market for 10INF, that they could sell to the merchants for 4500+INF.   Seriously.\n\nIn 4 hours I made 2 million INF which just goes to show you, super heroes is st00pid.  Or lazy.  I prefer to think of them as stupid.\n","collection":"posts","url":"/super-heroes-is-st00pid/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2008-06-18-spore-porn-sigh.md","collection":"posts","url":"/spore-porn-sigh/","path":"_posts/2008-06-18-spore-porn-sigh.md","id":"/spore-porn-sigh","draft":false,"categories":["Games","Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Spore Porn *sigh*","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2008/06/sporebox-150x150.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-06-18 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"spore-porn-sigh","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2008-06-17-super-heroes-is-st00pid.md","excerpt":"City of Heroes (and thus City of Villains) is one of those sleeper games that has a lot of hidden depth.

I pondered it a bit and it occurred to me that this was a very misleading question, and showed an error in thinking.  Of the three commonly used formats none of them are \"correct\" and all three of them have their place in web design.  This is very much a \"use the correct format, for the correct job.\"\n\nOf the three image types commonly used on the web today (GIF, PNG and JPEG) usually the argument comes in the form of people agreeing that JPEG has one use; and either GIF or PNG has the other use. The religious war begins when folks try to argue the merits of GIF versus PNG.  And usually it comes in the form of arguing PNG's new hotness and it's lack of support by Microsoft against GIF as the old standard that may not have as many features but at least its supported.\n\nLets examine each format;\n\n__Graphics Interchange Format__, or GIF is an 8 bit format that was introduced by CompuServe back in the late 80's. It's one of the first 2 image formats used on the world wide web and continues to be one of the big three formats used through out the web.  GIF images are compressed using the Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) lossless data compression technique and as of 1989 and the GIF89a format can store multiple images in a single stream.  The GIF format uses a palette of up to 256 distinct colors from the 24-bit RGB color space.\n\n__Portable Network Graphics__, or PNG was created in the mid 90's and was created with the intention of improving upon and replacing the GIF format.  The PNG brings to the table the ability to have an alpha channel transparency which gives us a much wider range of transparency options.   The PNG also gives us a much wider range of color depths than GIF (truecolor up to 48-bit compared to 8-bit 245-color), which allows for greater color precision and smoother fades..etc..  In just about every way the PNG is superior to the GIF, save one.  PNG's do not support storing multiple images in a single file.\n\n__Joint Photographic Experts Group__, or JPEG was a group who got together and issued a graphical standard (of the same name) back in the early 90's.  It's commonly used for compressing photographic images and allows for an adjustable degree of compression.  This adjustment gives the user a tradeoff between storage size and image quality.\n\n__In my opinion__,  any more for your small graphics I'd use PNG.  PNG's are far superior to GIF's in that they can achieve greater compression, have a \"cleaner\" compression algorithm, have wider range of color, more transparency options, and are very easy to work with.\n\nThe PNG's major down fall was it's lack of full support from Microsoft -- hell they used to crash IE4..  However, as of IE7 support is native (with full alpha transparency) and once IE6 hits its end of life (which I personally think needed to happen back in August of 2001) there really is only one reason to use a GIF and that's for animations.  (Though in all likelihood you'll see an influx of browsers supporting MNGs natively in the near future which is the PNG extension that supports animations.)\n\nFor any large color intense image (photographs) use a JPEG.\n\nIt really is that simple..\n\nIf you're aiming for IE6 and absolutely need to use a transparent PNG you can use various IE PNG fixs JS hacks to make them work -- though what a pain.  If you don't need the transparency just use a GIF.\n","collection":"posts","url":"/which-format-to-use-gif-jpeg-png/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2008-06-23-which-format-to-use-gif-jpeg-png.md","collection":"posts","url":"/which-format-to-use-gif-jpeg-png/","path":"_posts/2008-06-23-which-format-to-use-gif-jpeg-png.md","id":"/which-format-to-use-gif-jpeg-png","draft":false,"categories":["Software Development"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Which format to use; Gif, Jpeg, Png","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2008/06/pngdemo.png","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-06-23 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"which-format-to-use-gif-jpeg-png","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2008-06-25-javascript-obfuscation.md","content":"Code obfuscators will strip out the unnecessary characters like white space, tabs, newlines and comments.  The modern flock of javascript obfuscators will also go through and replace every command and variable in the file with some random key that points to an array which then gets eval'd back out at run time.  Generally speaking the code you see in an obfuscated javascript file looks like completely gobbledygook which is sorta the point.\n\nMy stance on it is simple;  Don't do it -- If you ever catch me encoding or obfuscating my javascript, come kick me square in the jimmy.  I simply cannot abide by people who think they need be secretive with javascript.  And lets be completely honest here, that's what it's about.\n\nSome folks will try to sling a steaming pile by saying it's to shrink the file size for bandwidth purposes, but that's crap -- most .jpgs on this site are larger than its javascript.  Most servers gzip everything before sending it to the client anyway so any file size benefits gained by obfuscation is nearly nil -- unless you've written war and peace in the comments of the file.\n\nJavascript obfuscation is purely about power -- People who think they are smart and have done something they want to be noted for obfuscate their code to play the pointless and asinine game of \"knowledge is power\".  They yammer on about how they don't want anyone to \"steal it\" -- which is again a steaming pile of shash.\n\nObfuscation is at best like a padlock on a door -- \"it keeps the honest people honest\" as my father would say. if someone wants it their gonna take it. More over, javascript on some webpage SHOULD be free and open.\n\nMost of these folks fail to realize that they themselves wouldn't be able to write the code in the first place if there wasn't a \"view source\" button.  Myself included -- And now you've written something you think is so awesome and innovative you need to hide it?!  Douche.\n\nBy obfuscating, all you're doing is refusing to give back to the community and saying \"fuck you\" to the very system that trained you to begin with.  You are stifling innovation in the industry, screwing over the little guy who doesn't know as much, and making yourself look like an ass, and generally speaking you should hang your head.\n\nAll of us are the modern day equivalent to shade tree mechanics.
