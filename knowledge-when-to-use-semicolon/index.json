Mmm maybe..   I'm an avid MMO player and ever since Cryptic first announced City of Heroes back in 2002(?) I was in love with the idea of a super hero MMO.   It really seems that all modern MMO's are fantasy based, and I have said for a while that I'm pretty fantasy-ed out.\n\nCryptic had sold CoH to the masses as this do anything engine that would mirror \"Champions\" the role playing game, without actually saying the word champions.   And to be honest, it turned out to be much less than champions.   Still a good game, but not the freeform system that everyone envisioned.  Lots of work and updates went into the game and it's still pretty fun.  I still play it.\n\nIn November of 2007 Cryptic sold their ownership of the CoH and City of Villains franchise to NCSoft so that they could work on their new super secret project!\n\nEnter, the real <a href=\"http://www.champions-online.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Champions Online</a>.  Everyone kind of assumed that the super secret project that Cryptic was working on was Champions Online.  I don't know this for sure, but I get the impression that they were trying to get the Champions Intellectual Property license for a long time -- like even back while working on CoH.  They didn't get it until recently,  once they got it they dropped CoH like a bad habit.\n\nThe Champions Online website was pretty lack luster to be fair and in all honesty the game as awhole looks like nothing but CoH 2.0.   I'm okay with that -- I think that the City of Heroes game is a great game with a lot of casual game play, and a lot of hidden depth as well for the hard core gamer..    So seeing them simply move forward with what City of Heroes is, but meld it a bit to make it more Champions like with new and improved, safe for carpets hotness..\n\nOh man that'd be great!  Having said that, the Champions Online website had a count down clock that finally counted down just the other day.  Most of us expected a new video, graphics, eyecandy or someting.. But I doubt anyone expected, what we got..\n\n<a href=\"http://www.startrekonline.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Star trek online's</a> website went live..  Cryptic got the Star Trek IP!!    So.. what that means is that Cryptic is doing two major MMO franchises at once!     Ugh..\n\nThis sorta seems bad to me.  Firstly, Star Trek seems to have a bit of a curse associated with it..  And now they are saying they are going to do both Star Trek AND Champions Online at the same time? Hrmmm This is worrisome.. I fear that this means we are going to get 2 bad games..  Bad for business, bad for the customers.. just.. bad.\n","collection":"posts","url":"/cryptic-studios/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2008-08-12-i-hate-airplanes.md","collection":"posts","url":"/i-hate-airplanes/","path":"_posts/2008-08-12-i-hate-airplanes.md","id":"/i-hate-airplanes","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"I hate commercial airplanes","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2008/08/airplanecockpit-150x150.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-08-12 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"i-hate-airplanes","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2008-07-28-cryptic-studios.md","excerpt":"Shooting themselves in the foot?

The copilot of the previous leg ( and pilot of the next leg ) of our trip let me sit in the pilots seat of the four year old 737 700.\n\nI sat there for thirty minutes talking to him about everything under the sun. Nice guy. He's an old computer nerd like me and my friends and we had a good chat. He showed me a lot of the controls for the plane and introduced me to the various screens as shown in the picture. My side is an exact mirror of what you see there. (with the exception of having a fairly competent pilot on that side. )\n\nDid you know that the 737 has pull down HUD? It was very cool. Wish I had thought to snap a couple more pics but I didn't think to take that one until just before I got up. It's odd but I felt so much better about the flight once I talked to him and found out he could have been one of us.\n\nMy friends are all now terrified of flying.. haha\n\n__Original Post__: I used to think I hated traveling in general, but the more I ponder it the more I realize that I like to travel. ... I just don't like to fly commercial.\n\nA hundred and fifty people jammed six abreast in a tiny metal tube thirty thousand feet in the air -- Not my idea of fun.\n\nSo of course, I find myself in exactly that situation.  IBM had an emergency offsite that they needed a UI developer to attend to and I was the likely (only?) choice.\n\nAnyone who knows me knows I don't like people as it is.  But put me in this situation where personal space and comfort are completely null and void and it begins to wear on my cherub like demeanor.\n\nPeople don't mean to be rude nor do they indend to bump and poke into me but some times I wonder if the stop trying on the plane.  It's almost as if folks say to themselves, \"fuck it, the isles are to small anyway so I'm gonna whack everyone as I walk past. \"\n\nSpeaking of that -- you gotta have a narrow ass to sit in these seats.  And I swear the lavatories have shrunk.  The ol'joke about the mile high club is a lie!!!  If a guy got a hard-on in there it'd push him into the isle!\n\nBut anyway.. Off I go to Boston to get yelled at by customers.

Grand Turismo was always my favorite franchise on the PS2 because the game was absolutely beautiful and fun to play.  However, I hated always being tied to the PS2.  I am not a big fan of console games, but it seems that our stock of racing games for PC have been fairly lack-luster.\n\nNot any more!  <a href=\"http://www.codemasters.com/grid/\" target=\"_blank\">Codemaster's, GRID</a> is a fantastic game.. Codemasters yet again earns the faith I put in them for a high quality product.. (Operation Flashpoint 2 better rule!)\nw\nOnce you get past the fact that you buy and sell cars through \"eBay Motors\" the game is quite enjoyable.. (I can't blame them for product placement.. I assume by letting Ebay, Champion, Valvoline... etc... add product placement and branding they can make the game for a lot less... Sponsors baby.. sponsors! It's not overly out of place and for the most part you don't even notice it.. )\n\nThe cars seem to drive pretty realistically and the realistic crash damage is awesome and adds a dynamic element to  the game..\n\nThe cars all move exactly as you would expect them to.  They seem to have real \"weight\" when they move which I like.  So many other car simulations just don't get it.. Codemasters really captured the feel of how a vehicle show move..\n\nOne thing I really think is a nice touch is that you can setup the game to know your real name, and as such say it when they talk to you. They recorded probably a 100 common names, both male and female as well as a bunch of nick names.. You can choose one as your \"audio name\" and when the pit crew guy talks to you via the radio he says your name.. I know that's really minor, and easy to do.. but its a nice touch and goes a long way towards immersion..\n\nSomething else I like is that it has a braking idiot light... The designers realized that they are simulating a very realistic sport, in an unrealistic medium and as such we as drivers have a hell of a lot of sensory information left completely out.. So knowing the proper time to brake for a sharp turn is often very hard to judge.. As such there is a little light in the lower left that will go green, yellow, red.. flash.. brake now you moron!!... etc.. I like that, but it needs to be right in the center of the screen.. Usually when amid 11 other cars all trying to get position and avoid crashing, its hard to notice..\n\nThe game does have an EXCELLENT multiplayer game..  Nothing more fun that doing race after race with other folks over the web.  The only real issue is that most people like running derby after derby and that gets told to me.. Also online game play being what it is, you do get quite a lot of douche bags who don't know how to do anything other than type \"fuck\" or \"nigger\" over and over again.. *sigh*  But so long as you can tune them out, its pretty fun.\n\nAt this point my only real complaint is that you MUST have a wheel.. trying to play this game with the keys (no mouse driving at all) is impossible or at least very hard with any accuracy.. (which makes sense.. I mean there is a good reason we drive with big analog wheels and not digital keys..)  So, having said that it's a completely invalid complaint but one that I figured I would voice.  I mean its a driving game after all, a wheel isn't out of the ordinary in the extremely rare situation of being in control of a car..\n\nWhen trying to drive with the keyboard the wheels, brakes and accelerator are either FULL ON, FULL OFF, FULL LEFT, or FULL RIGHT which makes for sporadic driving at best.\n\nI have 2 good wheels for my Playstation 2 but they don't use USB plugs so now I have to go buy a new wheel.. A little annoyed by that, but so be it.. I like racing games that much so I went out and got the R660 GT Motorsport racing wheel which I'll try to write a review about..  Some folks on the community grid forums can't get it to work with the game at all, but I'm having no troubles..\n\nWish list wise; I wish the game would actually make you pay for the damage you do to your car.. right now you can buy a 10 million dollar vehicle, total it.. and fixing it is free.. It shouldn't be.. but what can ya do.. this is really minor all things considered..\n\nThe reason this is important is because otherwise you can play the game as one bug crash derby and get away with it..\n\nI also wish you had more control over things like tire selection, engine tunings..etc..

Failure to update a registry key causes the Setup program to fail.\"\n\nWait..  You mean Administrator isn't root?  Why does the root login for my box not have root access?!  Who's the jackass that thought that was a good idea?! \n\nAnd Microsofts official stance is that you must edit your registry.. something that if you don't do 100% correctly, you're boned.  I swear they developers at Microsoft are the biggest bunch of asshats..  I'd love to hear why this is acceptable and how this got through QA.. Someone MUST know -- Please chime in..\n\nWhat's jacked up is on their website it actually says that this is for advanced users only and if you're not comfortable then here is our support link where you can pay us to help you.. (I'm paraphrasing.)\n\nThey give instructions on how to fix it, then below the instructions they say that they aren't responsible if these instructions don't work.  Awesome..  Gotta love good customer support on top of a huge snafu.\n\nTo save you the trouble, here are the steps to fix it;\n\n* <a href=\"http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756/\" target=\"_blank\">Backup your registry.</a>\n* <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=e8ba3e56-d8fe-4a91-93cf-ed6985e3927b&amp;displaylang=en\" target=\"_blank\">Download Microsofts Subinacl.</a>\n* <a href=\"/images/2008/09/reset.cmd\" target=\"_blank\">Download this file and double click it.</a>\n* <a href=\"http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322389/\" target=\"_blank\">Install Service Pack 3 from the FULL install.</a>\n\nIt works.  Step 1 is vital just in case, 2 is a microsoft tool that enables the script that is step three.  Step three is just what passes for a shell script, feel free to read it via notepad.  Also, step three takes about 10 minutes to run so go have a coke and a smile.\n\n I had actually been considering installing Vista just to test out DX10 on a different partition, now screw that.  Install Vista? Accept/Deny... Denied.\n\nGame developers please.. start releasing your games for Linux..  Let's make Microsoft shape up or get the hell out of the market..\n","collection":"posts","url":"/windows-xp-sp3-access-denied/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2008-10-28-game-review-farcry-2.md","collection":"posts","url":"/game-review-farcry-2/","path":"_posts/2008-10-28-game-review-farcry-2.md","id":"/game-review-farcry-2","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Game Review: Farcry 2","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2008/10/farcry2pc-150x150.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-10-28 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"game-review-farcry-2","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2008-09-15-windows-xp-sp3-access-denied.md","excerpt":" \"Updates are ready for your computer.  Click here to download these updates. \" But don't expect Windows XP to actually know how to install them.","id":"/windows-xp-sp3-access-denied","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Windows XP Sp.3 ... \"Access Denied!\"","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2008/09/software.png","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-09-15 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"windows-xp-sp3-access-denied","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2008-09-02-game-review-grid.md","excerpt":"So, I have always liked racing games.
