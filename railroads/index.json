So, the infamous anti-gaming crusader Jack Thompson has finally met his match in the form of the Florida Supreme Court who this week permanently disbarred him while in the background the announcer yelled \"headshot\" for all to see his shame..\n\nOkay that last bit may be a lie, but the rest is true. They stated that the disbarment was to take effect 30 days after the initial hearing back in September in order to allow him to shut down his practice.  Of course, being the douche bag that he is, he immediately filed his own emergency motion with the court in order to seek a retrial, however another Bar member would have had to vouch for him because they stated \"no motion for rehearing will be considered unless signed by a member in good standing with the Florida Bar\" which didn't happen.\n\nI think most lawyers were smart enough to stay away from this one..  And now a month later, his career as an attorney is over in Florida... Anyone wanna bet he will move?\n\nThe full press release says;\n   \n    Miami attorney Jack Thompson, nationally and internationally known by virtue of his effective and successful opposition over the last 20 years to the broadcast, marketing, and sale of adult-rated entertainment to children, has just been informed by the Florida Supreme Court that he has been disbarred from the practice of law today.\n\n    The timing of this disbarment transparently reveals its motivation: This past Friday Thompson filed a federal civil rights action against The Bar, the Supreme Court, and all seven of its Justices. This rush to disbarment is in retribution for the filing of that federal suit. With enemies this foolish, Thompson needs only the loyal friends he has.\n\n    Thompson looks forward to successfully litigating his federal claims, now before US District Court Judge Marcia Cooke in the Southern District of Florida.\n\n    Thompson always wanted to own a Bar. Now, armed with multiple US Supreme Court rulings that no state bar can do what it has done to Thompson, he is set to own that Bar.\n\nAll in all I think its somewhat amusing and I'm sure he doesn't realize that this whole thing is his own fault.  After 30 years of being an attorney in Flordia, the court finally had enough of his shit and he is officially \"Not Eligible to practice in Florida\".\n\nI'm sure he isn't done.  He will continue to weasel his way around the game industry causing problems and being a general annoyance.   I'm sure he'd blame my opinion on games.\n","collection":"posts","url":"/jack-tompson-has-been-disbarred/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2008-12-22-wow134.md","collection":"posts","url":"/wow134/","path":"_posts/2008-12-22-wow134.md","id":"/wow134","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"World of Warcraft and Error #134","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-12-22 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"wow134","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2008-10-30-jack-tompson-has-been-disbarred.md","excerpt":"So, the infamous anti-gaming crusader Jack Thompson has finally met his match in the form of the Florida Supreme Court who this week permanently disbarred him while in the background the announcer yelled \"headshot\" for all to see his shame..","id":"/jack-tompson-has-been-disbarred","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Jack Tompson has been disbarred","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-10-30 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"jack-tompson-has-been-disbarred","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2008-12-22-wow134.md","content":"The Blue Mods at the Blizzard World of Warcraft forums asked me to post about my problems so I did... again..  Note; I have posted about this numerous times, and each time it gets buried and unanswered or simply ignored.   I'm sorta getting sick of it.. I mean what the hell kind of customer support is this?  (None is the right answer.)\n\nSince WotLK came out I have been getting #134 errors. I am a software engineer by trade and understand that software is complex and I am more than willing to work with them to fix this.. I just wish they would stop blaming me (and/or my computer) for it.\n\nTo date I have noticed two things that I think are important and that bear mentioning;\n\n1.  This only happens to me after I have been playing the game for a couple of hours (memory leak?)\n2.  This only happens to me when I am flying either on a flight path or on my own flying mount.\n\nIts always a ReadSectors/DecompressData error.\n\nThings I have tried and it still happened;\n\na. __New Drivers / Old Drivers__ -- I have updated every driver ont he system to the latest and even tried older ones..\n\nb. __Higher resolution / Lower resolution__ -- I have tried playing the game from 1680x1050 to 800x600 (this was painful) and it still happened.\n\nc. __High graphics / Low graphics__ -- I have played with Max graphics settings (to include forcing AA through my nvidia drivers) and I have played with everything turned down and off.\n\nd. __Lots of addons / No addons__ -- I have played the game with all my addons cranked up and going, and no addons.. Questhelper seemed to exacerbate the issue so I have removed it, but I dont think it was the problem as its been gone for a while and its still a problem.\n\ne. __Scan Disk and Defrag__ -- at this point my machines harddrive is probably tired of me doing this\n\nf. __Deleted the wtf files, cache folder and other various bits__ -- at this point there is nothing left of my install from when I originally had the problem. I have completely moved the install, its in a different place physically on the drive. I continue to do what others suggest via the forum and nothing seems to help.\n\ng. __Run the repair tool__ -- I do this every time it happens and it does fix the problem for a time. Note however that its only a temporary fix. It does happen again forcing me to rerun the tool. Sometimes its a quick fix (15 minutes or so) other times it says its \"really corrupt\" and has to restore from an older version or something.. then update via the patcher. this takes a while and sucks when I'm trying to do a 25man naxx..\n\n#### Computer information:\n\nBoard: EVGA 122-CK-NF68 running the Nvidia nForce 680i SLI SPP chipset\n\nProcessor: Intel Core 2 Extreme Quad Core Qx6700 @ 2666 Mhz\n\nMemory: 2048mb (2x1024 DDR2)..

You just try to do more points to the enemy than they do to you..  It's a lot of fun and again, teamwork is the key.  For both sides.\n\nAll in all I am pretty impressed with the game.  The server sizes never get bigger than 8 players so lag is hardly ever an issue.. I was playing on a server in France earlier today and didn't notice any lag and didn't know the server location until the guys started speaking French which got me curious..\n\nAll in all I have to say this game gets 4.5 out of 5 stars for me..  It has very few cons..  The game has infinite replayability as each time you play it the procedural narrative system called simply \"the director\" changes everything based on who and how you're playing.\n\nMy main complains are few but here they are;\n\n* No save game feature in single player mode.\n* Limited weapon choices.\n* Team AI is very limiting and even poor when playing harder games\n\nI think the game's biggest failing is its lack of weapons..

Oh yes.. You will..\n\n**Frustration Factor** -- The almost constant injection of enemy soldiers in your way turns what would be an extremely fun puzzle game into an even more frustrating set of \"do overs\" as you try to do the same crappy set of objectives over and over again while they shoot at you..  You don't have time to observer the solution 9 times out of 10.. You're just running balls to the wall all the while trying not to be killed..  This sucks.\n\n**Runners Vision** -- The game is supposed to have a system by which you see where you're supposed to go and what you're supposed to do by cleverly placed visual queues in the form of the color red.   Firstly, a big thanks from all us color blind folks.   Secondly,  they don't work 90% of the time until you're standing right on top of them.  So you end up racing towards the unknown away from the guards trying to kill you.  You end up doing it over and over simply because you have no idea where or what you're supposed to be doing..  This sucks.\n\n**Sluggish** -- The input often feels extremely sluggish.  My game would have a solid 60FPS with vsync turned on or over a 100 without and still sometimes it feels like there is a delay in faiths responses to any input.  More over, even though she seems like she is running quickly, often it feels like she is wearing lead boots..\n\n**Single Solutions** -- Many of the \"puzzles\" are a single solution only situation in that if you didn't know to do the exact right thing, you're done.  Put another quarter in, try again.   Example;  if you didn't know to grab the gun and shoot out the window on the third floor of the room you wouldn't be able to jump across to it..  Or if you didn't know how to navigate the building side scaffolding correctly then you die horribly to the helicopter gunship.. or if you don't click the right mouse button at the right microsecond when the big dude is swinging the pipe, then he kills you.    This is just a small example, and really really lame.   These extremely scripted do or die points suck and detract from the game entirely.\n\n**Right Click My Ass** -- The right click grab thing is almost impossible to get working correctly.  I can't tell you the number of times my character was butt stroked to death simply because the 1/20th of a second red queue flashed before I could react.  Or my character was in the middle of a slide or some other action and couldn't react.. etc..\n\nOnce I did get a gun I just about always fell back on to my FPS roots and shot that sucker until empty.  This is sort of contrary to the point of the game, but I felt there was no other way to resolve the situations.\n\nFarther into the game you're confronting what I can only assume is your female counterpart on the roof of a cargo ship.. You're forced to play the \"grab the gun\" game again and this time there is no avoiding her.   You MUST do it to continue the game and it's nearly impossible.  You're only presented the opportunity to do it in rare circumstances and only for 1/20th of a second again.. It was entirely to hard, and the 20 or so deaths I took there made me want to throw in the towel.\n\nOnce I did get past that point I was excited that I finally got to move on, only to be thrust into an impossible chase scene.. Who were the assholes that thought raw frustration was fun?  The computer opponent is able to make jumps that you simpley can't make.. Sorry the cake is a lie.. OR if you can make them it's because you have been playing the game for a year and its second nature to you.. Also, making it timed is just fucking dumb.  If she \"gets too far ahead\" it STARTS YOU OVER!!  okay fuck it.. I'm done.\n\nThis shit isn't fun.  It's frustrating.  It speaks to the fact that the game designers didn't think the puzzle aspect of the game was fun enough when IT WAS!  They had to add all these crappy FPS elements and \"make it more exciting\".. All they succeeded in doing was pissing me off..\n\nI played pretty far through the game and I can say that I think it has a lot of potential.. The way you can interact with the game environment is awesome and every game out there needs to take a hint from it..  But mirrors edge itself isn't fun it's just too hard, and entirely too frustrating.\n\nI may continue to play it a bit, just because I don't want it to beat me.. but I'm not doing it out of enjoyment.. This is the first game that I might finish purely out of spite..\n\n","collection":"posts","url":"/mirrorsedge/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2009-01-18-malygos.md","collection":"posts","url":"/malygos/","path":"_posts/2009-01-18-malygos.md","id":"/malygos","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"25man Malygos","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2009/01/lichking_2-150x150.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-01-18 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"malygos","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2009-01-16-mirrorsedge.md","excerpt":"Mirrors Edge for the PC is a first person action-adventure puzzle game with an extremely compelling story line and quite possibly the most frustrating game play known to man.","id":"/mirrorsedge","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Game Review: Mirrors Edge","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2009/01/faith_of_mirrors_edge-150x150.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-01-16 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"mirrorsedge","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2009-01-14-game-review-left-4-dead.md","excerpt":"I have to admit that I'm not a huge fan of zombie thrillers, so I was hesitant about picking up the latest game from Valve; Left 4 Dead.  I just don't really get why people like zombies so much..","id":"/game-review-left-4-dead","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Game Review: Left 4 Dead","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2009/01/img_3442_left4dead_450x360-150x150.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-01-14 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"game-review-left-4-dead","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2009-01-05-railroads.md","excerpt":"I'm a bit of a Sid Meier's fan -- He will likely go down in history as the king of turn based strategy games with the introduction of the Civilization franchise in the early 1990's.","id":"/railroads","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Game Review: Railroads!","layout":"post","tags":["Reviews"],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-01-05 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"railroads","ext":".md"}
