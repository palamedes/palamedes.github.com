Way back then it took several days if not longer to travel all those distances and so quite often votes weren't being made at all. The electoral college system changed all that and allowed people to have a voice even when they weren't able to directly cast a ballot. It's very much a winner take all system, so in one sense the general election popular vote does not matter when you consider the country as a whole.\n\nWhere it does matter is at a state level; As a rule of thumb, the electoral college will award the winner of your states popular vote all of the state's electoral votes. And, the winner of the most electoral votes wins the general election.\n\nThe use of the electoral college system is a debatable issue at this point in history it gives and takes. On the one hand, it makes dissenting votes in a non-swing state meaningless. For example, if your state is heavily Democratic, your vote for Republican party member (while it still technically counts) really has no impact on the election as a whole.\n\nOn the other hand, it prevents grossly overpopulated states from having total control of the election. Without the electoral college vote system in place and if the popular vote was all that counted, states like California, New York, Illinois and Georgia would have a huge influence on the election while entire states like Iowa or Alaska (which are very lightly populated by comparison) would not have any significance in the election at all.\n\nWhat I find interesting is, I believe the electoral college system actually encourages people to not vote. Under the electoral college system, if you know your state is primarily Democratic or primarily Republican and you tend to vote the same way then you don't actually have to vote because really your vote won't count towards the popular vote of any other state and if your state votes your way already why bother taking the trip in the first place.\n\nOn the other hand, if your state primarily votes one way and you vote the other, then the electoral college system can be seen as a form of oppression or even tyranny of the masses because no amount of voting will actually make any difference -- so again why bother?\n\nI think at one time the electoral college system was really a good thing, but I'm not sure it is any more. Maybe it's something of a bygone age that needs to be reconsidered in this modern time of fast cars, internet and ultra connectivity. I think the original intention was good but is it still relevant?\n\nLet's take a vote...\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2012-11-05-wow-its-really-been-a-while.md","url":"/wow-its-really-been-a-while/","relative_path":"_posts/2012-11-05-wow-its-really-been-a-while.md","id":"/wow-its-really-been-a-while","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"layout":"post","title":"wow it's really been a while","tags":[],"published":true,"type":"post","image":"/images/2013/01/beenawhile.jpg","gallery":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2012-11-05 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"wow-its-really-been-a-while","ext":".md"},"url":"/electoral-college-versus-popular-vote/","relative_path":"_posts/2012-11-07-electoral-college-versus-popular-vote.md","id":"/electoral-college-versus-popular-vote","collection":"posts","excerpt":"So, with the 2012 presidential election finally over, I'd like to discuss some of the things that I saw during the whole shebang...","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"layout":"post","title":"Electoral college versus popular vote","tags":["Voting"],"published":true,"type":"post","ribbon":null,"image":"/images/2013/01/electoralvote.jpg","gallery":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2012-11-07 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"electoral-college-versus-popular-vote","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2012-11-05-wow-its-really-been-a-while.md","output":null,"content":"Hey guys, I'm went dark for quite some time apparently and I didn't really mean to let this much time passed since my last post.\n\nLife is been incredibly busy for me; I feel like I'm working three or four different jobs, playing three or four different games, waiting for a bunch of things that happen and ultimately I want to move the hell out of Texas.\n\nI'm still working on my own blogging solution, it's coming along nicely it's just not quite ready for prime time yet. More than anything I'm learning about Ruby and programming in the Ruby on rails environment. I'm sure once all is said and done all have a decent product to share with the world, but it still just too early to release. (Even though you can actually get it online right now it might github account -- I would avoid doing so for the time being.)\n\nI've actually made a couple posts on my new blogging system, and those will become available once my blogging system goes live but I haven't bothered import them into WordPress yet and probably won't.\n\nMelissa and I are still very much wanting to move out of Texas and go to someplace like Tennessee or Georgia. We've been doing a lot of research and have some areas in mind; right now were looking at Blue Ridge Georgia. It's a very beautiful area with a lot of resort like cabins and whatnot and I honestly can't wait to live there. However, we have to wait for David weekly to get off their ass and actually correct what's wrong with our house --  We are still fighting that seven-year long fight with them regarding our foundation issues. It's an endless battle and to be honest I'm really tired of it -- I just want it all to go away.\n\nBut towards that end, we started cleaning up the house and started moving things out that we don't want here when we do show the house.  Here soon I will contact a couple different realtors and have them come out and tell us what we need to do in order to proceed. here today or tomorrow, I'm going to get a storage unit so that the decrapification of the house may continue.\n\nI'm trying to think of what else is going on.\n\nI'm starting to get that really weird foot pain again. I have those orthotics that the doctor gave me but to be honest those damn things hurt me more then not wearing them. I think ultimately I just need some new shoes, my tennis shoes are really rather old at this point.\n\nSome friends and I are looking at creating our own little video/audio blogging podcast around the programming we do in projects that we want to participate in. More than anything it's going to be four guys talking to one another just, fucking around but it's going be a lot of fun. I doubt anyone will seriously watch it, more than anything is just a fun way for us to keep in touch and goof off. But to that end I went ahead and purchased a really nice podcasting microphone. I have it hooked up on a boom mic stand and everything so that it sticks right in front of my mouth and can easily be pushed out of the way when I don't need it.\n\nSo for grins I went ahead and got a copy of Dragon natural speaking so that I can do some dictation. I figure that if I'm going to get this really nice microphone and get it set up to do this podcasting thing I might as well kill two birds with one stone and get the dictation software that I've always wanted to try so that I can give it a whack.\n\nI have to admit I'm really rather impressed; Dragon NaturallySpeaking is really fucking cool. Everything you see in this post was actually dictated directly from word-of-mouth to the WordPress text box with very little editing done post process. (it just wouldn't recognize \"decrapification\" since it's not a real word and I'm still trying to figure out how to train that word in.. heh)\n\nI knew that there was a lot of really good dictation software out there but I had no concept that it was this good.\n\nThe other nice thing about this dictation solution is that it will likely encourage me to create more posts and updates.\n\nAnyway that's all for now I'll try to be better about updating sorry took so long -- not that anyone actually reads this.. I have to admit this stuff is more for me than anyone else.\n","previous":{"next":{"path":"_posts/2012-11-05-wow-its-really-been-a-while.md","url":"/wow-its-really-been-a-while/","relative_path":"_posts/2012-11-05-wow-its-really-been-a-while.md","id":"/wow-its-really-been-a-while","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"layout":"post","title":"wow it's really been a while","tags":[],"published":true,"type":"post","image":"/images/2013/01/beenawhile.jpg","gallery":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2012-11-05 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"wow-its-really-been-a-while","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2012-03-26-rubypress-wordpress-replacement.md","output":null,"content":"<a href=\"/images/2012/03/rubypress01.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"RubyPress\" src=\"/images/2012/03/rubypress01-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"RubyPress\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>RubyPress</span></a>\n\nSo a while back I had thought my WordPress install was getting exploited through some bug and decided I wanted to write my own replacement..

I'm a Ruby and Rails noob.. bear with me..\n\nThough I have to admin, it's coming together so quickly that I do entertain the notion of having something that might one day actually compete with WordPress.. WordPress itself has been around since 2003 and has a lot of very cool functionality that I doubt I'll ever match in my little toy project, but wouldn't it be fun?  =D\n\nIt is 100% open source; [https://github.com/palamedes/Press](https://github.com/palamedes/Press)\n\nI will keep working on it and eventually have something worth using I hope..  For now I'm still on WordPress..\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2012-03-02-tellico-turnings-sign.md","url":"/tellico-turnings-sign/","relative_path":"_posts/2012-03-02-tellico-turnings-sign.md","id":"/tellico-turnings-sign","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Hobbies"],"layout":"post","title":"Tellico Turnings Sign","tags":["Wood Working","Scroll Saw"],"status":"publish","type":"post","published":true,"image":"/images/2012/03/signone.jpg","gallery":null,"tile_size":"1x3","allow_comments":true,"date":"2012-03-02 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"tellico-turnings-sign","ext":".md"},"url":"/rubypress-wordpress-replacement/","relative_path":"_posts/2012-03-26-rubypress-wordpress-replacement.md","id":"/rubypress-wordpress-replacement","collection":"posts","excerpt":"So a while back I had thought my WordPress install was getting exploited through some bug and decided I wanted to write my own replacement...","draft":false,"categories":["Software Development"],"layout":"post","title":"RubyPress Wordpress Replacement","tags":["Ruby","Ruby on Rails","WordPress"],"published":true,"type":"post","image":"/images/2012/03/rubypress01-150x150.jpg","gallery":null,"ribbon":"ruby","allow_comments":true,"private":false,"date":"2012-03-26 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"rubypress-wordpress-replacement","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2012-03-02-tellico-turnings-sign.md","output":null,"content":"<a href=\"/images/2012/03/signone.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Tellico Turnings Sign\" src=\"/images/2012/03/signone-e1330746540276-150x102.jpg\" alt=\"Tellico Turnings Sign\" width=\"150\" height=\"102\" /><br /><span>Tellico Turnings Sign</span></a>\n\nSo while in [Tennessee with my father](/dads-new-store/ \"My latest trip to TN and Dads new store\"), I told him I'd make him some signs for his shop.   This was the first time I had ever attempted to do something like this and it took me the better part of 4 days working a couple hours a night to get one done.\n\n<a href=\"/images/2012/03/signtemplate.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"Sign Template\" src=\"/images/2012/03/signtemplate-e1330746875648-150x89.jpg\" alt=\"Sign Template\" width=\"150\" height=\"89\" /><br /><span>Sign Template</span></a>\n\nI created a template in photoshop that I thought would look nice based on discussions I had with dad while up there with intent of creating a sign wider than it was tall that would hang over the door of the shop.\n\nThe sign would be made up of three 1/4\" thick plywood panels.  Each outer panel would have the lettering cut out via the scroll saw and the inner panel would be stained dark and then sandwiched between the outers in order to give the final appearance.\n\nI made one side \"clean\" and professional looking (or rather as professional as I could with my meager skills), and one side more of an \"art\" look to it where I intentionally over sanded some of it just to get a unique look.  The edges are routed and rounded over and the sign as a whole is sanded smooth.\n\nI don't know if I like the \"art\" side.. I mean it doesn't look horrible and it does have that unique scrubbed and hard used look I was going for, but I used too much glue when putting the sign together and it shows..  lesson learned..\n\nThe sign is 20\" wide by 12\" tall by 3/4\" thick and all in all not too bad if I do say so myself.\n","previous":{"next":{"path":"_posts/2012-03-02-tellico-turnings-sign.md","url":"/tellico-turnings-sign/","relative_path":"_posts/2012-03-02-tellico-turnings-sign.md","id":"/tellico-turnings-sign","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Hobbies"],"layout":"post","title":"Tellico Turnings Sign","tags":["Wood Working","Scroll Saw"],"status":"publish","type":"post","published":true,"image":"/images/2012/03/signone.jpg","gallery":null,"tile_size":"1x3","allow_comments":true,"date":"2012-03-02 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"tellico-turnings-sign","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2012-02-29-dads-new-store.md","output":null,"content":"<a href=\"/images/2012/02/shop00.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Tellico Turnings 01\" src=\"/images/2012/02/shop00-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Tellico Turnings\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Tellico Turnings Shop</span></a>\n\nThis last week I got to spend some quality time with the folks in Tennessee and more specifically time alone with my father (which I haven't gotten to do in years) at his new store.  It was pretty great!\n\nDad has finally opened his shop at the Turkey Creek Market in Tennessee (Booth R&amp;S 20!) and will hopefully be a bazillionare in short order..\n\nHe had contacted me a while back about doing this and I was fairly excited about it with him but I had a different vision of what I thought the store should look like.   I had a some what more sterile and professional business notion in mind and I'm really glad that they didn't go that route.\n\nInstead the store is a warm and inviting one that presents the goods in an orderly but not overly professional manner that is probably far more appealing to people than anything I could have come up with.. (Leave the designing to the designers I guess.. Its good to know what I'm not good at..heh)\n\n<a href=\"/images/2012/02/shop01.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"Tellico Turnings 02\" src=\"/images/2012/02/shop01-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Tellico Turnings\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>The pens and calls table</span></a>\n\nHe has just the right amount of space with the right number of items out presented in an organized and uncluttered way that I think really does a good job of showing off the various pieces.\n\nThe market is open Friday, Saturday and Sunday each week from roughly 9am to 6pm each day except Sunday which I believe was 10 to 5.   Plus all the vendors around you are actually quite nice, friendly and even helpful. More over, the environment for the vendors is one that actually promotes helping one another as opposed to infighting or backstabbing which is really nice.\n\nIt's unfortunate that his first weekend wasn't a stellar one.  He made rent which is all that really matters but it would be nice if he had sold more his first weekend out if for no other reason than to inspire and excite..\n\n<a href=\"/images/2012/02/shop02.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Tellico Turnings\" src=\"/images/2012/02/shop02-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Tellico Turnings\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Peppermills and Stuff</span></a>\n\nProbably completely unrealistic for him to do better than he did considering it was;\n\na) his first weekend there and no one knew where he was,\nb) between pay days so no one had money,\nc) between major holidays so no one had a \"reason\" to buy things,\nd) there was a major dinosaur exhibit in town which kept the crowd down, and\ne) a large format gun show which also that kept the crowd down.. etc..\n\nAll that working against him and he still made enough sales to pay for itself..  So I guess I shouldn't complain too much.. I just really wanted him to sell out! hah\n\nFor me it was a disappointment but he's an old hat at doing markets and having a booth selling stuff and so he knows that it can be feast or famine.. he didn't seem put out by it at all..\n\nThe crowd Friday was admittedly dismal which apparently is very common there.. Saturday and Sunday however had a lot of folks coming through and just about all of them picked up stuff and took cards which is a great sign for his future there..\n\n<a href=\"/images/2012/02/shop03.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"Tellico Turnings\" src=\"/images/2012/02/shop03-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Tellico Turnings\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Wine table &amp; Lamps</span></a>\n\nMy only concern at this point is that his stuff is actually too nice for the venue and that people might think of the market more as a \"flea market\" than an actual hand crafted goods marketplace..   Only time will tell here and we probably don't need to do any second guessing at this early stage based on a single weekend..\n\nMore over I think it will take a couple weeks to figure out what works and what doesn't work and then adjust accordingly.  More than likely he's going to have to start adding a lot of less expensive stock that will sit next to the really nice stuff just to draw folks in..\n\nAfter all, selling 10x $5 items is just as good as selling a single $50 item..   Certainly a lot less fun to make but you gotta make stuff that sells..\n\n<a href=\"/images/2012/02/shop04.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Tellico Turnings\" src=\"/images/2012/02/shop04-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Tellico Turnings\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Dad in the background</span></a>\n\nAfter only a few days I had to return home and get back to work.. Apparently my boss wants me to actually \"earn\" my living.. psh.. slave driver I tell ya..\n\nI made the 1000 mile drive straight from East TN to Central Texas in under 16 hours and had a seriously sore backside to prove it..  I also had a SUV full of wood and project ideas, as well as plans to make some signage for the shop.\n\nAll in all it was a great trip and one I'll likely make again in the future.\n\nI really like Tennessee and one of these days will likely move there more permanently..  For now I'm stuck in Texas though... Y'all.\n\nThe trip was really great and it was fun to hang out with the folks but it really made me realize that my home is where ever my wife is.. sappy, but true.\n\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2012-02-13-scroll-saw-and-mlt-13-wooden-clock.md","url":"/scroll-saw-and-mlt-13-wooden-clock/","relative_path":"_posts/2012-02-13-scroll-saw-and-mlt-13-wooden-clock.md","id":"/scroll-saw-and-mlt-13-wooden-clock","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Hobbies"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Scroll Saw and MLT-13 Wooden Clock","layout":"post","tags":["Wood Working","Scroll Saw","Clock"],"image":"/images/2012/02/Marble-Strike-by-Alain-Saintagne-1.jpg","ribbon":null,"tile_size":"2x2","private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2012-02-13 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"scroll-saw-and-mlt-13-wooden-clock","ext":".md"},"url":"/dads-new-store/","relative_path":"_posts/2012-02-29-dads-new-store.md","id":"/dads-new-store","collection":"posts","excerpt":"This last week I got to spend some quality time with the folks in Tennessee and more specifically time alone with my father (which I haven't gotten to do in years) at his new store.  It was pretty great!","draft":false,"categories":["Hobbies"],"layout":"post","title":"My latest trip to TN and Dads new store","tags":["Wood Working"],"type":"post","published":true,"image":"/images/2012/02/shop00.jpg","allow_comments":true,"date":"2012-02-29 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"dads-new-store","ext":".md"},"url":"/tellico-turnings-sign/","relative_path":"_posts/2012-03-02-tellico-turnings-sign.md","id":"/tellico-turnings-sign","collection":"posts","excerpt":"So while in Tennessee with my father, I told him I'd make him some signs for his shop...","draft":false,"categories":["Hobbies"],"layout":"post","title":"Tellico Turnings Sign","tags":["Wood Working","Scroll Saw"],"status":"publish","type":"post","published":true,"image":"/images/2012/03/signone.jpg","gallery":null,"tile_size":"1x3","allow_comments":true,"date":"2012-03-02 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"tellico-turnings-sign","ext":".md"},"url":"/rubypress-wordpress-replacement/","relative_path":"_posts/2012-03-26-rubypress-wordpress-replacement.md","id":"/rubypress-wordpress-replacement","collection":"posts","excerpt":"So a while back I had thought my WordPress install was getting exploited through some bug and decided I wanted to write my own replacement...","draft":false,"categories":["Software Development"],"layout":"post","title":"RubyPress Wordpress Replacement","tags":["Ruby","Ruby on Rails","WordPress"],"published":true,"type":"post","image":"/images/2012/03/rubypress01-150x150.jpg","gallery":null,"ribbon":"ruby","allow_comments":true,"private":false,"date":"2012-03-26 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"rubypress-wordpress-replacement","ext":".md"}
