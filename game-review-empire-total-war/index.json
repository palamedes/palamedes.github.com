Why the hell not?!  At this point I think it would be just as easy/difficult to create a game via a webbrowser as it would via any other medium..\n\nMore over you wouldn't have to sell any kind of client.. everyone with a modern computer has a web browser..  You trade having to create a game that works with hundreds of different graphics drivers and computer configurations for having to deal with 5 major browsers that all do things slightly differently, but big deal..  jQuery does most of that nicely, so really you're only stuck fixing CSS issues..\n\nAs always the trick is in coming up with a game that is compelling enough that others want to play it.  I mentioned Masters of Orion above because I think that's likely one of the best games of all time and as such a perfect candidate for remake in this format.\n\nGranted you're not going to make the next 3D masterpiece as a browser based game.. but I say good..  Games these days are moving towards looking good with zero game play..  Give me a game that is fun to play any day over the latest wiz-bang graphics.. I think the browser game market is a good place to try this..\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2009-03-11-jquery-lightbox.md","url":"/jquery-lightbox/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-03-11-jquery-lightbox.md","id":"/jquery-lightbox","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Software Development"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"jQuery Lightbox","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2009/03/rocky-mountains-poster.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-03-11 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"jquery-lightbox","ext":".md"},"url":"/jquery-and-browser-based-games/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-03-20-jquery-and-browser-based-games.md","id":"/jquery-and-browser-based-games","collection":"posts","excerpt":"I have been playing with the jQuery animate functionality a bit today and it occurred to me that jQuery would likely be the perfect library to build a browser based game on top of..","draft":false,"categories":["Software Development"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"jQuery and Browser based games","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2009/03/t-and-c-surf-designs.png","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-03-20 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"jquery-and-browser-based-games","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2009-03-11-jquery-lightbox.md","output":null,"content":"<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2009/03/rocky-mountains-poster.jpg\" class='pull-right'><img title=\"rocky-mountains-poster\" src=\"/images/2009/03/rocky-mountains-poster-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Lightbox Test\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Lightbox Test Image</span></a>\n\nI have been playing with the javascript library jQuery for a couple days now.. My intent is to learn the ins and out's of it for a project at work.  So far I like what I am seeing.\n\nI need to learn a \"best practices\" as there are many ways to do things in jQuery and I am very likely going about some of it incorrectly..  But, there is only one way to try things and that's to jump off the deep end!  So far it's cake..  Something I have wanted for my site for a while now was a lightbox implementation.  And while Wordpress has quite a few lightbox like plugins, I thought it would be interesting to create my own using jQuery such that ANY link (on any website) with an attribute of rel=\"lightbox\" would be opened as a lightbox.  This is the file I'm actively developing on;\n\n<pre id=\"line13\"><span class=\"attribute-value\">http://rsow.com/files/jquery.lightbox.js</span></pre>\n\nAnd the image above will be my lightbox test image for the time being.  Clicking the image will close the lightbox.\n\nSo far so good!  The lightbox appears to be working nicely.  Clicking the image correctly pulls the \"shade\" (the darker background) and opens a white background over the shade with a \"loading\" gif.  It then loads the image into memory.   Once the image is loaded, it then resizes the white background to the size of the image, and displays the image in the place of the loading image.\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2009/03/wideimage.jpg\" class='pull-right'><img title=\"wideimage\" src=\"/images/2009/03/wideimage-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Large Wide Image\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Large Wide Image</span></a>\n\nYou most likely wont ever see the loading GIF unless you're loading a very large image like the one to the left.  But that brought up a different problem.  What if the image is larger than the screen?\n\nThe lightbox will now automatically size the image to fit your screen upon load. If you resize your desktop while the lightbox is displaying it wont adjust itself yet.\n\nAt this point the only real pain is remembering to add rel=\"lightbox\" to your anchors.  I'm sure there is a way to get Wordpress to play nice with that regard.. not sure yet.  Also my goal was to make it so that the only thing you would need would be to add jQuery and my jQuery.lightbox files to your site and you're good to go. Unfortunately I forgot about the loading graphic.. so you'll want that gif too..  And it will need to live at /images/loading.gif   You can use any you like, so long as it's there and it isn't too large.\n\n<img title=\"Loading\" src=\"/images/loading.gif\" alt=\"Loading GIF\" width=\"48\" height=\"47\" class='pull-left' />\n\nFeel free to use mine..\n\nI want to add some more features to this thing.. I dunno how crazy I'll get though.  Comments would be nice on an image by image basis, but not sure how to go about that.  Either I can try to embed the comments in the page in some hidden way and then have jQuery pull them or I could try loading them from a similarily named file that resides next to the image?  I dunno.\n\nI also like the idea of creating other forms of pop-ups / lightbox styles through the use of the rel attribute.  If you use \"lightbox\" it does what it does now, but if you use \"lightbox_zoom\" (or something) it does something else..   I already have other ideas but I dunno how crazy I want to get.\n\nRight now this system has no way to do groups either.. this is purely a singleton solution right now.  I'd like to add more features but for now it's where its at.  I'm a little stunned at how easy it was to create to be honest.  This bodes very well for jQuery.\n","previous":{"next":{"path":"_posts/2009-03-11-jquery-lightbox.md","url":"/jquery-lightbox/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-03-11-jquery-lightbox.md","id":"/jquery-lightbox","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Software Development"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"jQuery Lightbox","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2009/03/rocky-mountains-poster.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-03-11 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"jquery-lightbox","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2009-03-09-game-review-empire-total-war.md","output":null,"content":"<img title=\"Empire:Total War\" src=\"/images/2009/03/empire_christmas2007_1024x768-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Empire: Total War!\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" class='pull-right' />\n\nSo I have long been a fan of the Total War franchise created by Creative Assembly..  Their games have always been pretty fun -- but most of them have been fairly buggy..  There was a lot of stuff going on and the games were generally still playable, so for the most part those bugs could be forgiven.\n\nEmpire Total War is the latest in the franchise and easily the most anticipated as well as the most well received..  All the various publications have drooled over this game and praised it for being pure liquid awesome as well as having given it a 94 meta score which pretty much assures it will be the game of the year..\n\nI read everything I could find about it and was very much looking forward to this game -- I do enjoy it for the most part.  I just don't feel it deserves quite all the hype is has gotten.  More over I kind of wonder if the Creative Assembly folks didn't pay for some of those favorable reviews...

I didn't switch to 98 until 99.. I didn't go to NT at all, and stayed on W2k Pro until well after XP was out.  The only reason I went XP was because it was on the new computer I had purchased already..\n\nMy reason for not wanting to upgrade to the newest version of windows was usually because it's painful, the upgrade sucks and quite often I have to go back.  (I wont even go into my Windows ME story.. I had one of the Microsoft Windows ME senior developers tell me to go back to 98 because ME sucked...  Yeah.. It happened..)\n\nMore over upgrading isn't the way to go.. you should wipe fresh and start over..  I usually dreaded this..   What cured that?  Funnily enough, Ubuntu..\n\nI have installed and reinstalled ubuntu so many times I'm an old hat at it..  It's really easy.    So I went into Windows 7 thinking it was going to be back to the pain..  And was pleasantly surprised..\n\nFirstly what Windows 7 isn't;  It isn't a new OS.  Lets be clear here.. Windows 7 is what Vista should have been.  It's more than a reskin to be sure, but mostly it's a refactor of Vista and a general rebranding to get away from the down right awful publicity that Vista rightly deserved..\n\nHaving said that, I like W7 quite a bit actually.  I have had some issues getting my sound card drivers working, but now that I do everything's peachy.   Because it's entirely based on the Vista core just download and install Vista drivers for it and as a rule you're good to go.\n\nThe install process was simple and clean, and since I installed it on a new drive it correctly put the windows bootloader on the main drive (though it did overwrite my grub loader so now I can't get into linux.. will have to add the linux install to windows bootloader..)    The install was fairly quick all things considered, and it configured all my hardware correctly.\n\nI had World of Warcraft up and running within about 3 minutes of installing the OS because I had precopied it to the drive heh.   Yay I have DX10 now!\n\nMy biggest complaint at this point is two fold;  1. the alt+tab functionality seems really slow and clunky in W7.. In XP its instant.. but for whatever reason in W7 it takes a couple seconds.. Minor complaint though really.. it is a beta after all..\n\nSecondly, I want to know what will happen in August when the license expires..  Will I just be screwed and have to reinstall all over again?  They have already stated that you wont be able to install the automatic updates beyond that point and that the OS will die then.. I find that... Odd..\n\nOH well.. I can say that I would likely purchase this OS if it continues to perform as nicely as it does now.  Since it's the premier gaming platform for PC's at this point I don't have much choice.. heh\n\nI still very much like my Mac.. I still very much like Ubuntu.. but the games demand Dx10, so <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">Vista</span>.. er,  Windows 7 it is..\n","previous":{"next":{"path":"_posts/2009-02-05-windows-7-beta.md","url":"/windows-7-beta/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-02-05-windows-7-beta.md","id":"/windows-7-beta","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Software Review: Windows 7 Beta","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2009/02/vista_7_1-150x150.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-02-05 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"windows-7-beta","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2009-02-01-game-review-dawn-of-war-2.md","output":null,"content":"<img title=\"Dawn of War 2\" src=\"/images/2009/02/dawn-of-war-2-1642-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Dawn of War 2\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" class='pull-right' />\n\nI love Warhammer.  I have played Warhammer table top war game both fantasy and 40k pretty much since they came out.  I also have the Warhammer fantasy role playing game, the more recent Warhammer 40k role playing game and gave the Warhammer fantasy MMO a spin.\n\nGames workshop has done a really good job at creating a compelling IP (too bad blizzard stole most of it.. but I digress).. So I was extremely excited about Dawn of War, though for whatever reason I didn't get to play it much.\n\nDoW looked very good and I wanted to make sure that I played DoW2!    I wasn't about to let more Warhammer goodness slip by!\n\nDoW2 made by Relic studios uses the same engine that Company of Heroes uses and looks fantastic.   More over, so long as you never actually try to play other people you'll have a great time!    The game is designed to be very fast paced and they have removed the \"build\" element from the game entirely.\n\nIt's pretty clear to me that they have geared this game towards the 16 to 20 year old Korean kids or people with a severe case of ADD as the game plays at a pretty much frantic pace.   Not my style, but I can see why it would be fun.\n\nMore over, I bet if I were actually able to play it multiplayer it would be a cool game..   Oh but I can't.\n\nWhy you ask?\n\nSimple really.. Relic uses the same craptacular network code that Company of Heroes used back in 2006, and as such a good 50% of the game owners out there, can't play it online.  The game always complains of a \"NAT ERROR\".\n\nI can (and do) play other multiplayer games all the time.  I can play GRID, Call of Duty, Battlefield 2142, Left 4 Dead, TFC2..etc.. all multiplayer, all online over the internet and all work just fine.   Yet DoW2 (and Company of Heroes) all say my network is bad.   And I have tried everything right down to plugging my system directly into the modem which generally I think is a bad idea..\n\nMore over, the relic forums have a LOT of folks complaining about this issue.  Since this exact same error has been in effect since CoH was released in 2006.. It's pretty apparent that Relic doesn't give a crap..  And as such, I will not buy this game, and would further ask others to not buy this game.\n\nIf the game developers can refuse to fix a problem that has been plaguing their games for a while (and blame the users instead of their code or code decsisions for the problem), then why should I or any one else buy their game?     You don't reward the dog and say \"good boy\" when he craps on the carpet..  Paying money for something we can't use effectively rewards them for making something that doesn't work.\n\nI wont be buying this game.  The game play gets a 2 1/2 out of 5.. the speed RTS isn't my style but I can see what some would like it, however the removal of the build element completely turns the game into a zerg fest designed to compete with star craft 2 which I don't find fun at all..\n\nThe network thing drags the score down to a 1.  Fix your shit Relic.\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2009-01-30-wow134fix.md","url":"/wow134fix/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-01-30-wow134fix.md","id":"/wow134fix","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"World of Warcraft, #134 Error -- Fixed","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-01-30 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"wow134fix","ext":".md"},"url":"/game-review-dawn-of-war-2/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-02-01-game-review-dawn-of-war-2.md","id":"/game-review-dawn-of-war-2","collection":"posts","excerpt":"I love Warhammer.  I have played Warhammer table top war game both fantasy and 40k pretty much since they came out.  I also have the Warhammer fantasy role playing game, the more recent Warhammer 40k role playing game and gave the Warhammer fantasy MMO a spin.","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Game Review: Dawn of War 2","layout":"post","tags":["Warhammer","Review"],"image":"/images/2009/02/dawn-of-war-2-1642-150x150.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-02-01 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"game-review-dawn-of-war-2","ext":".md"},"url":"/windows-7-beta/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-02-05-windows-7-beta.md","id":"/windows-7-beta","collection":"posts","excerpt":"I'm generally slow to change operating systems..  When it comes to making one of those sweeping changes, traditionally I was the equivalent of an old man on his porch yelling for \"you kids to get off my lawn!\"   I was a curmudgeon and quite often would refuse to budge.","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Software Review: Windows 7 Beta","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2009/02/vista_7_1-150x150.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-02-05 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"windows-7-beta","ext":".md"},"url":"/game-review-empire-total-war/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-03-09-game-review-empire-total-war.md","id":"/game-review-empire-total-war","collection":"posts","excerpt":"So I have long been a fan of the Total War franchise created by Creative Assembly..  Their games have always been pretty fun -- but most of them have been fairly buggy..","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Game Review: Empire: Total War","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2009/03/empire_christmas2007_1024x768-150x150.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-03-09 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"game-review-empire-total-war","ext":".md"}
