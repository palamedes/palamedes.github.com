Tipping is no longer a gratuity, in that it's not something that is given voluntarily or beyond any obligation but rather it's expected.  And some how if you don't tip beyond a certain amount, you're the bad guy.\n\nIt doesn't matter that the service completely sucked.. No no.. We are the bad ones for not giving them extra money for their crappy service.\n\nI say screw that – if the service sucked then why should we give them a tip at all?!  But I get ahead of myself..  Let me start at the beginning..\n\nMy office went to lunch today to a favorite sushi place that we often frequent.   There were 12 of us and we had an hour or so to get some lunch.  12 is a lot of people and we knew it would be tight trying to do that lunch in that amount of time.. We certainly didn't expect it to take over two hours like it did..\n\nAnyway, as a former waiter myself I understand that it can be tough handling that many people.  It's up to the waiter though to ask for help if they need it, instead of letting the service suffer.  Its also up to management to step in and offer help or assign other people to the ticket if others are needed.\n\nWe all made our order and sat there.. and sat there.. and sat there..  I had originally ordered something and asked for the rolls to be replaced or changed because I didn't really like those, and she flat out refused.  I wasn't ordering a special or anything.. instead she made me order a second plate of what I actually wanted AND the rolls I didn't want (which came with the sushi I did want).. but fine.. I'll do that.. No sense in making things difficult..\n\nI was the first one served.  Both my orders came out about 20 minutes after we ordered and it took another 30 or 40 minutes for the rest of the people to be served (It may have been longer).  By the time the last person was served their food, most people were done..   So.. the last several folks didn't get anything, until the first people had completed their meal..  That's an obscenely long time for a “lunch”.\n\nShe wouldn't split up the check so we had to handle it ourselves.  We pooled some cash and wrote down on the back of the ticket how much to charge to each of the credit cards placed in the little sleeve.\n\nI don't know the total of the bill, but 12 people at a sushi place I'm gonna guess it was around $250..  She counted the cash at the table and there was over $100.. she then ran off to charge the cards.  After ten to fifteen minutes she came back with stuff for us to sign.. We sign and head out.\n\nAll is well I thought.  We got half way backed out of the space when she comes charging out of the restaurant with charge tickets waiving trying to stop us..  Of course we stop, and ask what the problem is. I thought we didn't pay enough.. someone forgot their card.. someone didn't sign.. something..\n\nShe actually said, “You didn't tip!” .... “The amount on the bill wasn't with tip, and you didn't tip but 10%”...    Uh.. you're shitting me right?!  Did you actually just charge after us because you feel we didn't give you a big enough tip?!\n\nWhat the fuck?!  We paid the bill.. Plus gave 10% despite the service, and you actually think it's okay to rush out and confront us about it?    Where do you get off?\n\nIf they don't put the automatic “tip” in with the charge, that's not our fault.   If you would cut the check up into separate bills it would be easier to to tell, again not our fault.   If it didn't take us 2 hours to eat, then maybe we would tip more.. again.. not on us..\n\nBut you don't get to rush out to our car and confront us about it..\n\nAt the end she actually said; “But its only 10%.. there isn't any tip in with the amount of the bill. You only gave me 10%..  But thats okay! Thats just fine!” in a very snotty way, and stormed off..  Basically saying that we only tipped her 10% and she wanted to make sure we knew that she knew.\n\nTipping is a gratuity..  Or should be..  If the service sucks, if they argue with you about your order, if they refuse to split checks, if they take hours to serve, if the fruit on your plate looked like it stayed out too late drinking, or had been served in last nights cocktail.. etc..  It should be okay to express your opinion with your wallet.  Read: “Service sucked, no extra money for you.”\n\nI've been a waiter.. I know the deal.. If I performed poorly I knew I wasn't going to get much.. And I never though it was okay to go confront my customers about it..  That's NEVER okay..  She got 10%, and her final performance was very much like the rest of it – makes me want to ask for that 10% back.\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2007-03-22-webbased-4x-game-in-the-moo-vein.md","url":"/webbased-4x-game-in-the-moo-vein/","relative_path":"_posts/2007-03-22-webbased-4x-game-in-the-moo-vein.md","id":"/webbased-4x-game-in-the-moo-vein","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Webbased 4X game in the MoO vein","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2007-03-22 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"webbased-4x-game-in-the-moo-vein","ext":".md"},"url":"/tipping-is-a-gratuity/","relative_path":"_posts/2007-04-10-tipping-is-a-gratuity.md","id":"/tipping-is-a-gratuity","collection":"posts","excerpt":"I really hate how in America today, and most likely the world wide, tipping is required.

Typically I try to make something bigger than is really realistic for my skills.  Some grandiose scheme that is so massive even a dedicated company with money to spare would scoff at it's vastness, little alone a single person with marginal programming skills.\n\nSo, in thinking about what those skills are and trying to keep a game within that vein; I have been considering a browser based <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4X\">4X game</a> done like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_orion\">Masters of Orion</a> or <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.freeorion.org/index.php/Main_Page\">FreeOrion</a> (come on guys, I'm rooting for ya!).  More over, I'd like to make this a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMO\">MMO</a> style game in that you're not alone in the universe.\n\nThe rest of this post is me thinking out loud -- take it with a grain of salt.\n\nThis would all revolve around a web service which would host the games.  There would be many different games running at once. This would allow players to join as many games as they like. These games are independent of each other and give the player something to do while waiting for a turn to end in a different game.  This also allows for the division of ability such that you can have a beginner game, and an expert game..etc.\nEach game would be a browser based massively multiplayer online turn based (or real time) game (BBMMOTBG?! Say that three times fast) where you struggle to conquer the universe.\n\n-Basic Gameplay-\n\nThe basic game play flow would be probably pretty close to what you're thinking when you think of Masters of Orion.  You start in a random location in a universe with a bunch of other star systems which in turn have planets and other objects..etc.  In fact this will pretty much be a clone of MoO or FreeOrion but in a browser - thus leaving the core of the game design already done. We can of course expand from that but the basic game play is the same.\nIn short; You move from one system to the next exploring and trying to reveal the map.  This is how you find other races/beings/npcs/pcs..whatever. All the while expanding your territory and technology such that you can deal with new found \"threats\" (cause everyone else is a threat). You also must gain new resources and protect them from others who are trying to exterminate you, while you kill them.  Sounds like fun.\n\n-Real Time or Turn Based?-\n\nThis is a tough decision and to be completely honest, I can see it going either way right now.  Real time is trickier and presents more issues, however both game models will have their own hurdles.\n\nThe major issues as I see them are thus;\n\nReal Time Game Issues:\n\n* A real time game typically goes to the person who is playing the most.  The instant that someone logs off to go eat, or sleep is when everyone else will pounce.\n* There will be some technical issues with displaying things in real time to browsers however I feel these can easily be solved with either Flash or Ajax.  (I lean towards ajax)\n\nTurn Based Game Issues:\n\n* By its very nature, a turn based game will be slow. Players will very quickly become bored while waiting for the turn to advance so they can go again.\n* Must give the players something else to do while waiting for the turn to advance.. maybe some realtime mini-games?\n\nRight now I'm leaning towards turn based on the major games and maybe offering a realtime game for smaller matches. It shouldn't be too hard to offer both actually.\n\n<u>Home World or Mothership?</u>\n\nOne argument against this style of game play is that anyone who logs off or who isn't actively playing 24 hours a day, is a target.  I'd like to figure out a way where by someones home world is basically impossible to take or maybe give them a mother ship instead of a home world where they can keep moving all the time.  The mother ship would only be in the game while the player is actively playing the game.  If they log out, the mother ship provides a mechanic through you can say they went into warp or some such..\n\nI personally like the idea of a home world that is near impossible to destroy.  Its not super useful other than it is your starting point.  It gives its own resources but very few.  The idea being if a player is beaten back to a home world they could still in time create new ships and what not to move out.  If someone does finally destroy your home world, then you're out of the game and rightly so as it's very hard to do.\n\nThe mother ship idea while having some merit, tends to prolong the game and encourages attacks from behind or out of nowhere.  Plus if you're doing poorly or you're directly under attack you could just log out, which would remove your mother ship from the world until the other person is gone at which point you just log back in.. Basically making you unkillable.  I think this would annoy players.\n\nAt this time, you start the game with a Home World.\n\n<u>Restarts or forever persistent?\n</u>\n\nThe ultimate goal of the game is to take over the universe and exterminate the other players and NPC's.  In some games that follow a similar model, it gets to the point where a new player simply can not compete with the current top player.  Thus they usually come a point in a game when someone has \"won\".  Meaning, if you follow that model the games would only last for so long before you would have to restart everything and even the playing field all over again.\n\nRestart Pros - Persistent Cons:\n\n* Fresh playing field every x number of days\n* All players start over with the same possibility of winning the next game\n* New players that log in to play aren't instantly trounced which means they have a chance\n* Easy to maintain metrics that would allow us to rank players from one game to the next\n* Resources can start over on a completely new / random playing field.\n* The universe can stay smaller because you know that it will start again fresh eventually\n\nRestart Cons - Persistent Pros:\n\n* Restart kills the sense of accomplishment over the long term unless we give them some added character benefits that travel with them from one game to the next\n* Persistent has sense of accomplishment, but only for those who are winning.\n\nI think its a pretty good argument for a game system that only lasts X number of turns or Y number of days.. whatever, then restart.\n\nAt this time, the game will restart every so often.\n\n-Start mid game?-\n\nPlayers should be allowed to start mid-game.  The whole point behind having multiple games running all at once is to give players as much opportunity to play as possible.  So while they are waiting for their \"main game\" to advance, they can log into an already running game and start fresh.  So long as there is an unexplored/unclaimed system still on the map, a new player may join the campaign.\n\nTurn lengths and Turns in general-\n\nEach turn would be made every X amount of time, or in the event that everyone has clicked the \"end turn\" button, instantly.  Most likely you would make turns happen ever 10 minutes or so.   This gives you ample time to get up and walk away from it and come back to it later.  Plus even if you're gone for an hour, you've missed a whole 6 turns.. Woopie..\n\nThe down side to this is it makes the game VERY slow.  We need to try to avoid the slowness.  I'm not too sure how to deal with this in a turn based game.  If there are only 2 players logged in, and both have ended their turn you can go ahead and progress the game a turn.  But if there are 100 players actively playing you can't advance the turn until either the time is up, or the players have ALL gone.\n\nYou only have to worry about those players that are logged in as players that aren't logged in aren't there to do anything anyway.\n\nThat also brings up the ability to allow players to do some minor scripting in the event of things..  Allowing players to do basic stuff via a script or some other management system for when they are off line would be nice..\n\nIn the beginning turns should happen in a fixed amount of time, or in real time.\n\nMore as I ponder it... Stay tuned.\n","previous":{"next":{"path":"_posts/2007-03-22-webbased-4x-game-in-the-moo-vein.md","url":"/webbased-4x-game-in-the-moo-vein/","relative_path":"_posts/2007-03-22-webbased-4x-game-in-the-moo-vein.md","id":"/webbased-4x-game-in-the-moo-vein","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Webbased 4X game in the MoO vein","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2007-03-22 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"webbased-4x-game-in-the-moo-vein","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2007-03-12-pulling-weeds-in-my-big-ass-yard.md","output":null,"content":"1 Acre = 4047 Square Meters\n1 Acre = 4640 Square Yards\n1 Acre = 41260 Square Feet\n1 Acre = 8*80 gallon bags of weeds\n1 Acre = A very very sore Jason\n\nA can't believe how sore I am.  Now in all fairness, my front yard and my backyard combined are roughly an acre.  My front yard is only ~26000 sq. feet which is where I was working - so it's not an acre, but spend 6 hours hunched over and doing squats over weeds and you'll think its an acre..

This rant is for you!\n\nAnytime you find your self in the predicament of being trapped in a small box with one or more complete strangers, it's time to employ the use of something that most people never use; Manners.  You might even want to whip out and dust off, common sense, another ill-used and often neglected commodity.\n\nMost likely this torturous sojourn will only last a minute or two, but sometimes it can seem like forever. This is largely due to the fact that most people are completely oblivious to the fact that they are being painfully discourteous and down right rude to the other passengers.  To the \"others\" I say; You're not alone, and you're not the most important person there.  Suspend any and all activity (with the exception of breathing and heart beats) until you get off the elevator.\n\nTo the complainers I say; there is a certain amount of \"discomfort\" that you're going to have to accept here due to the relative size of the elevator. Short and sweet, you either share the space with the \"others\" or you use the stairs.  To the \"others\" I say; try to make that situation as comfortable as possible by following some extremely simple rules;\n\n__When waiting for the elevator, don't stand directly infront of the door. __\n\nDuh.  There is a good chance people are going to be getting off the elevator, so don't block the door ya dolt.\n\n__If the button has already been pushed, don't push it again.__\n\nHey guys. If you walk up to an elevator and someone has already push the UP button, pushing it more wont make the elevator go any faster.  Its not like the elevator thinks, \"Oh Mr. Highandmighty is waiting.. I better hurry..\".. No.. it just makes you look like an ass.. Stand there and wait patiently!\n\n__Before getting on the elevator, let those who are already on get off first.__\n\nDon't try to crowd your fat ass on to the elevator while people are trying to get off!  This is mostly to women.. YOU WAIT!   When everyone that is getting off, then and only then, may you proceed onto the elevator.  I can't tell you how many times people have tried to push their way onto an elevator when people where trying to exit.  You can wait 10 seconds for them to exit.\n\n__If the elevator is full, wait for the next one.__\n\nDear god.. the 1 minute it takes for the elevator to come back wont kill you.  If the compartment is full, don't try to elbow your way among the other sardines.. Just wait!\n\n__Push the button for your floor once, or not at all if already lit.__\n\nYou impatient shit!  Don't sit there pounding on the floor button because you're in a hurry.. the whole world is in a hurry, slow down and wait.  The extra 3 seconds it takes for the door to close wont kill you.  You just end up looking like an ass.\n\n__Don't push or even touch the close door button.__\n\nYet again, impatient jerks will stand there hammering on the close door button.  'cause they are in a hurry.. Never mind grandma who is trying to get on the elevator; \"no I want the door to close! I'm in a hurry!\"  Fuck you.  Keep your fat digit away from the close door button.  I'd be fine if they removed it completely..  Or better yet, everytime you poke it the elevator voice should say \"The button pusher is an asshole!\" really loudly.  You can wait. It takes what?  3 seconds.. maybe 5.. Oh gosh.. we might be late!\n\n__Hold the door open for people. __\n\nIf someone is very clearly coming to the elevator, hold the damn door for them you selfish bitch.  Ladies, if someone is walking through a door behind you.. HOLD THE DOOR!  Same goes for elevators.  The world doesn't revolve around you.\n\n__When entering the elevator, go as far back as possible.__\n\nYo! Meatsack!  Move all the way to the back of the elevator to make room.  Most likely there are more people getting on the elevator.. Move your tub of guts out of the way.\n\n__Whoever is in front, goes first.__\n\nLadies, if someone is in front of you getting off the elevator (you are both going to the same floor) THEY GO FIRST.  I have actually seen on more than one occasion women claw there way from the back of the elevator so they can get off before someone that was right next to the door. Fuck you. You wait! Again, and this may seem like a theme,  3 or 4 seconds wont kill you.\n\n__If the car is crowded, ask for your floor.__\n\nIf you get on the elevator, and you can't reach the buttons - hell even if you can, just blurt out a floor.  Followed by that rarely used word \"Please\".  It may take several tries to pronounce it correctly, so you may want to practice..    Try it the next time you get on an elevator.. \"3 please\".  I bet you someone will be more than happy to push the button for you.. Most likely followed by pushing the close door button.\n\n__Face the door you're exiting.__\n\nRemember, personal space is at a premium on an elevator.  And thus to help maximized the sense of area around individuals it's best to not look them in the eye.  Don't be an obnoxious twit and stare at someone.  Face the door.. Eyes front dirtbag!\n\n__Don't preen in the mirror.__\n\nMany elevators have a mirrored finish, this isn't an excuse to put on makeup ladies. You should have done that shit at home.. and most likely it didn't do any good anyway.. Put it away!  And the next bitch who puts on hairspray while I'm standing next to her in the elevator gets curbstomped.  I mean seriously.. Hairspray!\n\n.. I can keep going for days.. Most of these rules are very simple and are easily covered by \"Common sense\".. which is so uncommon as to be a rare commodity..   Sometimes I wish we could bottle it and sell it.. But thats for another thread..\n\nNeedless to say, be polite on elevators.  There is a good chance that you're going to be sharing the same elevator with the same people over and over.   How about be nice for a change?\n","previous":{"next":{"path":"_posts/2007-03-12-elevator-etiquette.md","url":"/elevator-etiquette/","relative_path":"_posts/2007-03-12-elevator-etiquette.md","id":"/elevator-etiquette","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Elevator Etiquette","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2007-03-12 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"elevator-etiquette","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2007-03-02-vegas-baby.md","output":null,"content":"Well we just got back from a three day in Vegas.. It was really only about 48 hours all together and I must admit, I'm glad to be home.\n\nVegas has really gone to hell.. I mean it was always a seedy pit, but it's gotten much worse of late it seems.. It's so massively over crowded.. It's impossible to walk anywhere without being shoulder to shoulder with folks you most likely don't want anything to do with..\n\nAnd the number of \"porn flapper drones\" on the street was stunning.. Every five feet there was some guy trying to hand out little porn fliers, and he would flap them against one another so they would make a snap noise, and then shove it into your gut ..  Do these things work?!  Firstly.. I dont want anything that some drone on the street is trying to hand me.. AND does these people not see that I'm walking with a woman?!  I'm probably not going to be interested in porn at that moment.. thanks..\n\nWe did get to see some neat stuff.. We went and saw the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mandalaybay.com/entertainment/sharkreef.aspx\">Shark Reef exhibit</a> at Mandalay bay and it was nice.  Crowded, and short.. but a very cool view of the undersea world..\n\nWe also saw <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tropicanalv.com/ent_bodies.asp\">Bodies the Exhibition</a> at the Tropicana and let me tell you, it was stunning.. VERY long.. but awesome..  Humans are in fact, made of meat.\n\nHowever, the pinnacle of the visit turned out to be the show we saw on the night before we came home.  We got to see the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cirquedusoleil.com/cirquedusoleil/ka/\">Cirque Du Soleil show, Kà</a> at the MGM Grand.  It was more than impressive.  A very good show and I recommend it.  However, I would say that the $69.95 nose bleed seats aren't the way to go.. But since the trip as a whole was meant to be done on the cheap, It was okay.\n\nEasily the worst part of the trip was the flight to and from Vegas.. Both were so turbulent that I nearly lost my lunch.. I hate planes..  On the way home they had to pull the plane back to the gate after we had pushed back to replace something that had broken.. Nothing instills confidence more than knowing you have fresh parts, on your broken plane..\n\nAll in all I had fun.. it was a fun trip but Vegas isn't what I remember it being..\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2007-02-14-six-figures-for-a-domain.md","url":"/six-figures-for-a-domain/","relative_path":"_posts/2007-02-14-six-figures-for-a-domain.md","id":"/six-figures-for-a-domain","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Six figures for a domain?!","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2007-02-14 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"six-figures-for-a-domain","ext":".md"},"url":"/vegas-baby/","relative_path":"_posts/2007-03-02-vegas-baby.md","id":"/vegas-baby","collection":"posts","excerpt":"Well we just got back from a three day in Vegas..
