I know, shocking..   The RIAA, is suing XM for offering a device that allows people to record songs off the XM satellite service.   Recording songs off the radio for home use is 100% legal.  However, because those boondogglers had convinced Sirius to pay a bunch of extra money in the form of a licensing fee, they now want XM to pay as well.    This is yet another example of how the RIAA are a bunch of greedy shits.\n\nWhat's really jacked up is that the RIAA actually insisted that they wouldn't complain about private home recording devices.  Of course, someone has to feed the greedy beast so the sue happy bastards are at it again..\n\nI have to say that every time I see \"RIAA\" .. whatever follows usually pisses me off..  At this point, they are a four letter word.  They are making millions of dollars on their products alone, but have decided that they need more and more so go out of their way to extort money from every poor slob they come across..\n\nThe RIAA claims to help musicians - that seems like a bunch of crap.  It really seems like the RIAA are more for helping the producers the packagers, the big box stores and everything else BUT the musicians.   There are millions of musicians out there who aren't being protected but rather are left out in the cold so that the RIAA can toss another log of money on the fire for one or two \"major\" stars.\n\nHere's a clue guys.. The more you promote music, the more people will consume it.  XM and Sirius are promoting the consumption of music by allowing people to record (crappy recordings) to their own systems.  They aren't discouraging it..The more hoops you force people to jump through the less likely they are to do so..  MP3's cause people to BUY music.. not keep them away from it.   Why do you think iTunes like stores work?\n\nI don't understand why you would sue a service that is promoting your industry - and doing so in a FAR better capacity than you have EVER done..  Instead of continuing to hang on to your outdated business model, why not leap forward into the 90's and embrace this change..\n\nIs this about the publicity that you're getting, because you're getting the wrong kind.  Everyone in their life has known that kid that always needed attention - good attention/bad attention, it didn't matter.. just something.. (Sort of like how some recent \"starlettes\" can't seem to find a pair of underwear..) Is this only about money? Or is all this just about control?\n\nI mean the control argument makes some sense, but not a lot.. The record companies don't want us to use our personal players, and thus promote their songs, because that would remove them from control.  The piracy argument is a bunch of shash we know that because the MPAA/Hollywood have admitted as much by directly saying that DRM is not about preventing piracy.. So is this a control thing?\n\nThe more you sqeeze your fist, the more customers will slip through your fingers..  Consumers vote with their wallets -  I for one wont be buying any more music until the RIAA are gone, and I haven't since 2000.  I'm just one person though, but you keep pissing on the masses the more likely you're signing you're own death.\n\nI have to think that it must be about money because the control thing just doesn't make logical sense..  The problem is you're coming across as a mobster.. and that's not good.  Quick.. someone call Eliot Ness..\n\nThe irony is, you fear piracy so much that you have gone to extraordenary lengths to stop it, only to have created the very environment with which it is acceptable; You have enabled your own downfall.\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2007-01-19-ie7s-jsfoo-sucks-so-badly-its-painful.md","url":"/ie7s-jsfoo-sucks-so-badly-its-painful/","relative_path":"_posts/2007-01-19-ie7s-jsfoo-sucks-so-badly-its-painful.md","id":"/ie7s-jsfoo-sucks-so-badly-its-painful","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"IE7's JSFoo sucks so badly it's painful!","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2007-01-19 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"ie7s-jsfoo-sucks-so-badly-its-painful","ext":".md"},"url":"/the-riaa-pissing-on-the-masses/","relative_path":"_posts/2007-01-22-the-riaa-pissing-on-the-masses.md","id":"/the-riaa-pissing-on-the-masses","collection":"posts","excerpt":"So.. yet again the RIAA has decided to sue someone..

IE7's javascript engine is complete shit.  They need to scrap it completely and start over.  Firstly, It's sloooowww..  IE7's JS is slower than IE6.. which I find to be impressive as IE6 was slow as hell..\n\nIn one of my current projects we have a bunch of objects being cloned in real time to make a popup menu.  It pops up over all other divs and what not from a nested element to a child element of the body.  It's a very simple procedure;\n\nMouse over the icon - pop goes the menu.\n\nWe are attaching the event to fire the pop dynamically.. (Don't even get me started on the \"attachEvent\" command.. Can we please use addEventListener like everyone else.. )  When the even fires it is sent to a function which does the work.\n\nAll other browsers know that \"this\" in that function is the sender.. Not IE.  IE expressly requires you to define the sender through the function handle and then call \"sender.fromElement\" to get the sender.  That's retarded.  Oh but the good times don't stop there.. No no..\n\nSee it takes time to figure out who the sender is, and it will report the sender as whatever is below the mouse when it finally gets around to it.    So the fromElement could be fricken anything! Its the most unreliable crap on the planet.\n\nThank you very much Microsoft for this wonderful piece of crap browser.
