Gone are the heady days of playing games with huge pixilated sprite based characters running down a two dimensional scrolling map dodging mushrooms and grabbing floating coins..\n\nMost games have embraced the power of 3D and have gotten so good at it, in fact, that sometimes you can't tell the game engine screen from reality.. Anyone that has played Half-life 2 can attest to that.\n\nThe problem with most of these games that strive to simulate ultra-reality is that they forget that they are doing so in an extremely unrealistic medium.\n\nFirst person shooter style games are very bad about this in that they will usually strive to deliver weaponry that is based on the real world equivalent..\n\nBut all games suffer from the same issues here, you can't simulate reality with a monitor and some speakers.. There is no way to get true surround sound or peripheral vision which goes a long way to inform us about our reality.\n\nTry walking around for a couple hours looking through toilet paper tubes. This would pretty accurately reflect what you're doing when looking at a game reality through the use of a monitor.\n\nUnfortunately, at this time there is no real worth while solution to that..\n\nBut another problem that comes up there is a solution to -- if you care enough to try;\n\nIn any game, if a problem or situation arises, you only have so many ways to deal with it. You can only do those things that the coders of the game programmed in as solutions.\n\nThat's very much unlike reality where if a problem occurs, you can think and be creative about how you want to solve it. And the solution you use to deal with a real world issue isn't going to be the same solution that someone else would come up with. It might be, but doesn't have to be.\n\nIn a game environment you can only solve issues the ways in which the programmers gave you to solve it. The more vast the game, then the more likely it is that there is only one solution to your particular issue simply because the coders don't have a lot of time to program in all the various ways to finish one thing. Thus, the solution you figured out for a problem in a game, is most likely the exact same way someone else will deal with it..\n\nNo creativity required.. infact.. no creativity allowed..\n\nThis is a huge barrier to every game out there and goes a long way to hurt every game there is simply because the programmers solution may not be intuitive to someone else..\n\nIf a game engine could be created that would allow players of the game to be creative.. allow them to try things, ANY thing.. things that the programmer had never intended in the first place.. And do it in such away as to not break or exploit the game.. I believe that game would blow the rest of them out of the water..\n\nThis change in mind set on how games work and allowing players this sort of freedom would bring a whole new level of \"reality\" to games. While it doesn't solve the monitor issue.. it does allow that creativity that has been otherwise stifled up to now.\n\nEverquest2 is a good game but very much suffers from the \"no creativity {thinking} required\" problem.\n\nQuests are given to you by NPC's and you run around \"solving\" the quest. But \"solving\" to these people doesn't entail puzzles that change and it certainly doesn't allow you to be creative about the answers, but rather it means that you have to go one step at a time doing something and then run back to the NPC to update it to the next step.. Etc.. Sometimes it's hard to not drool.. They are completely scripted.. There is typically only one answer to each step..\n\nFor some reason, this is a popular system.. Everquest2 has thousands of such quests. \"No creativity required\".\n\nI'm not picking on Everquest2.. I have played it from the beginning and will for the foreseeable future.. All games suffer from this.\n\nI find it funny that most massively multiplayer online games call themselves role playing games. And yet if you seriously play you realize that role playing in games like this is all but dead. Mostly because creativity is stifled by the game engine itself.\n\nThis is something that will have to be addressed at the very core of the game engine.\n\nThere are many solutions to every problem in the modern day world, so why do we limit everyone in a game to one solution only? This harkens back to the days of M.U.D.'s when everything was text based and you had to type in exactly what the programmer had typed in to get something to work. \"Open the chest with the large skeleton key.\"\n\nWhen we went to a graphical interface they simply gave you a single button to push, as opposed to allowing for something more..\n\nNo key? Try your foot.. try hitting it with a hammer.. try tossing it off a cliff.. A suitable application of explosives might work.. How about a laser?\n\nSo how do we go about addressing this?\n\nHow do you let a person be creative in a game?\n\nI think first of all you have to start at the micro level in the game environment.\n\nA player needs to be able to manipulate EVERYTHING in the game environment. Everything in the game environment needs to have a \"physical\" presence and react accordingly when fiddle with by a player.\n\nThis alone is a huge undertaking.\n\nFrom there, you provide players with very simple abilities.. Pickup, put down.. move.. gather.. push.. pull.. lift.. drop.. throw.. hit.. kick.. etc..\n\nThose abilities combined with a physics engine and a reality engine would do the trick.\n\nThe physics engine would know that if you dropped a rubber ball from x height it would behave in y way. Standard physics..\n\nThe reality engine is the other trick -- and there is no reason you couldn't combine the two.. but I say keep them separate that way when the PPU's (Physics processor unit) come out in a couple years (and I believe they will) you can easily adapt..\n\nThe reality engine says.. if you drop this object, made of metal on these two wires one of which has electricity running through it.. it will cause a X reaction.. In this case a short.\n\nThat way if the solution to the player is to complete that circuit.. ANY metal object would do.. unless that metal object is a bomb.. then the reality engine would punish the player with a nice explosion.. etc..\n\nSee it's actually very simple.. you go down to the very core basic abilities that all humans have to manipulate things.. then apply the logic of what those things are and how they behave..\n\nBoom.. You have creativity. Or at least you have the starts of a system that would allow a person to be creative. Allow a player to think.. Get rid of the canned / scripted solutions.. Allow the players to devise their own clever solutions.\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2005-01-01-ambivalent-about-people.md","url":"/ambivalent-about-people/","relative_path":"_posts/2005-01-01-ambivalent-about-people.md","id":"/ambivalent-about-people","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Ambivalent about people","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2005-01-01 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"ambivalent-about-people","ext":".md"},"url":"/creativity-in-modern-games/","relative_path":"_posts/2005-01-02-creativity-in-modern-games.md","id":"/creativity-in-modern-games","collection":"posts","excerpt":"One of the main issues with games today is that they are all striving very hard to simulate reality.","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Creativity in modern games","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2005-01-02 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"creativity-in-modern-games","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2005-01-01-ambivalent-about-people.md","output":null,"content":"Sometimes I wish I were alone, out in space.. A lone trader.. Just trying to make a living.. Not bothering anyone.. More to the point, not being bothered.. This of course is a silly wish.. No one else in space to trade with as of this writing.. I think this irrational desire signifies my.... Contempt?... Dislike?... for other people. Though other times I want to be with people.. hang out.. if only just for a time.. Ambivalence? I dunno.\n\nMaybe it's a safety thing. Out in space, in my little ship.. I would only allow those people into my life that I specifically wanted there. Other people simply wouldn't get the password to my little club. A perfect way to live life without truly living. In my self contained cube with no chance of being hurt. No chance of forced interaction.\n\nSometimes that sounds wonderful. Other times it sounds frightening... Ambivalence?\n\nJust when I start to like people.. Just when I start to get comfortable with the way people are and accept them for who they want to be.. Just when I start to think the world is going to be okay.. Something comes along and reminds me that people, in general, are fucktards. Most people tread their way through their lives without giving one thought to everyone else around them.\n\nMost people think they are king, the ruler of the world.\nMost people think nothing bad could ever happen to them, and if it did it's someone else's fault.\nMost people think that there is no way they could be at fault, it is always someone else.\nMost people think their way is the right way and everyone else is wrong, period.\nMost people are wrong.\nMost people are in denial.\nMost people need a reality check.\nMost people need a life lesson.\n\nLife doesn't work the way you want it to in the pretty fantasy world. That is why I am not that lone space man with my perfectly chosen world. You aren't the only one living your life, everyone around you is living it too. Their actions are a direct result of your actions. Most of the time they aren't to blame, you are. Your way isn't always the right way, many times there are a bunch of right ways. Your way may be wrong. You don't know everything. Most likely, you don't really know anything. Take the time to look around and try if even only for a second, to grasp what is going on around you. You are not king. You aren't the center of the universe.\n\nI went to go see a movie the other day. Sat down just as my friends were arriving, we came in separate vehicles. Steve sat to my left, Pat to my right. Pat was drunk. Not fall down stupid drunk, but annoyingly loud drunk. Just drunk enough to not know when to shut up. I don't like drunk people. I don't hang out with drunk people. You wouldn't be invited in to my space ship if I knew you were drunk.\n\nThe movie started but there wasn't any sound. The pictures were moving but no sound was coming out. For about 5 minutes we watching a completely silent move. Boy was it dull. People around the audience were yelling at the screen and making fun. My \"friend\" Pat, the drunk one, kept saying quite loudly, \"fuck I really wanted to see this god damned movie.\" I tried to shhh him but he wouldn't have anything to do with it. It was a kids movie we had come to see, so there were quite a few children about the movie theater, not counting Pat of course. So I know that some of the parents around us were probably tired of hearing the cussing. And had they said anything, note I said 'SAID', we would have shut up and apologized. But that isn't what happened. Not at all.\n\n\"Damn! I really wanted to see this fucking movie!\"\n\nOf a sudden the guy in the seat in front of us jerked around and grabbed Pat. This pissed me off, immediately and completely. I leaned forward..\n\n\"Hey you need to keep your hands off my friend... I don't know who you think you are but...\" that's all I got out, before he cuffed me. He just backhanded me. Wasn't hard, just enough to get my attention and really annoy me. Good thing it wasn't a hard hit or it would have spawned a totally different reaction. One much less, pleasant.\n\n\"Are you out of your fucking mind?! You're going to just haul off and hit me in a movie theater?\" I yelled standing up.. Boy if I had thought the theater was quiet a second ago, it was nothing compared to now.\n\n\"Well you were cussing!\" he says, as if that is going to justify everything. Oh well okay then..\n\n\"OH .. Cussing is a mortal sin, but hauling off and smacking someone.. That's okay.. If you have a problem with something someone is doing you ask, or you get the manager you don't put your hands on someone.. \"\n\n\"Well I will go get the manager.. \" {'cause I'm a yutz and can't play well with others and have no clue how to solve this myself}\n\n\"Oh.. we are just trying to watch a movie,\" his fat wife sitting next to his two kids says, \" and you terrible people just ruined it..\"\n\nOh come on lady. Your charming husband just smacked me and it's our fault? I bet he beats you too huh. I mean if this guy.. this manly man, is willing to whack someone in a theater.. A complete stranger no less, I bet he hits you at home all the time. What about the kiddies? Daddy come home after a bad day and spank them too? 'cause they deserved it', I'm sure.\n\nSo he leaves and goes and gets the management.. Or at least that is what I supposed. He comes back with 3 or 4 sixteen year olds that are the cleaners of the theaters. It's funny that he went and got a bunch of them, like they were going to muscle us out of the theater.. hah Joke.\n\nThis story is totally anticlimactic by the way -- So, if you are reading it hoping that someone pulls a gun out or something you are going to be disappointed..\n\nWe were escorted out of the theater and into the lobby area where I confronted this guy. I basically told him that he had no right to put his hands on anyone and that he certainly had no right to hit me. Which of course he denied. I told him that if we were bothering him he can ask us to stop. And if we continue to bother him he can get the manager or the police. That's it. Those are his options. So what does he do? Guess...\n\nHe gets the cops. The theater that I frequent is a nice new theater and for whatever reason they keep a police officer on staff. For unruly customers like me I guess. He goes off and explains to the officer about how we were being terrible people and how he asked us three times to be quiet and how we refused and were doing it just to spite him.. huh?! Where the fuck did that version of reality take place.. He thinks he is king and that there is no way he could be at fault.. What I don't get is how he thinks he could be right.. I mean he smacks me and then HE goes and gets the cops? Why is this idiot continuing to escalate this situation? I could have pressed charges and he would have been in cuffs. I didn't.. But I could have. I consider myself a better person than that. It just saddens me that this person wasn't.\n\nHe single handedly reaffirmed my animosity towards other people.. Well.. animosity is a strong word.. Maybe ambivalence.. I must admit I seriously wanted to pop this guy in the nose. I just can't fathom how he thinks he could be right. I can't count the number of times when I was wrong on something and I apologized, \"Woops.. Hey man.. I was wrong.. sorry..\" I have done that before and will do that again..\n\nWhy couldn't this guy do that? My father used to tell me all the time that it's better to be the bigger person, the better man if you will and just let it go. But it doesn't feel as good. I really wanted to teach this guy a lesson. But who am I? Maybe I am wrong. Either way.. I walked away.. What a jerk. Yet another person who thought they were king. Someone, one day will squash his delusional rule. I just wasn't sure that person should have been me.. And thus I backed off.\n\nThat guy is definitely not allowed on my space ship.\n","previous":{"next":{"path":"_posts/2005-01-01-ambivalent-about-people.md","url":"/ambivalent-about-people/","relative_path":"_posts/2005-01-01-ambivalent-about-people.md","id":"/ambivalent-about-people","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Ambivalent about people","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2005-01-01 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"ambivalent-about-people","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2004-12-21-sky-diving.md","output":null,"content":"I got to do something that was literally above and beyond the range of the word cool. I got to jump out of an airplane at 14,000 ft.\n\nMost people that do that sort of thing go tandem. Meaning they harness themselves to the front of some expert before they jump out of a plane so that all they have to do is enjoy the ride. It's a lot of fun that way because all you have to do is fall.\n\nI on the other hand, am a bit too big to go tandem so I had to leave the plane on my own. I took a 5-hour class (that lasted for 8 hours) that taught the finer points of falling out of an airplane. They go over how you fall and how everything works so you can function on the way out. They teach you how to land and how to react once out of the plane. They also go over emergency procedures and what to do if something isn't working correctly. You are all alone out there when you do the accelerated free fall class and it was important to really get this stuff. I went over it and over it and over it..\n\nI must say that I am amazed that I had the presence of mind to actually do that stuff upon exiting the plane. The sensory overload is beyond compare. You leave the airplane and enter a world that is just indescribable. The world is rushing up at you at 160 miles an hour. The wind is deafening. The view is spectacular. The drop zone suddenly seems very, very small. Something that was very large while standing there was suddenly the size of a postage stamp, and the spot you were supposed to hit was the size of an \"o\". Literally, it was about the size of that o.\n\nIt was great fun! I was in complete awe with the whole experience.\n\nThe day started for me at 5:30 am. I had to wake up early because the skydiving place was about an hour away and we needed to be there before 8:00 am. I got up, showered, and got ready to go. I wasn't nervous at all, and was a bit excited. Normally getting up at 5:30 in the morning was just out of the question, but not this day. No sir, I hopped out of bed.\n\nI drove to my friend, Pat's house and picked him up. Soon, we were off. We headed to the drop-zone and only stopped for about 20 minutes to pick up some food. Once we got there we started to fill out a bunch of paperwork, the basic, \"Our lawyer is bigger than your lawyer\" stuff. Once everyone was there we all went into a classroom and began the lessons.\n\nI won't bore you with the detail's here but the class wasn't as good as it should have been. They really should have drilled things in more than they did. At one point in the class I was quite confused and was getting nervous because of my confusion. Eventually I got it all and knew what I had to do. I wasn't \"comfortable\" with everything because we only went over it for 5 hours, but I figured I got it. Looking back on it, that 5 hour course should have been stretched out over several days. (but then they do call it Accelerated free fall. It's accelerated alright.. sheesh)\n\nThe winds were blowing hard that day. The gusts were up to 28 miles an hour, holding around 22. They put us on hold for quite a while. Eventually we got to go up, I think they just gave up on waiting because they wanted to get us out of an airplane before we forgot everything. Again looking back on this, they should have waited.\n\nEventually I got suited up and get my chute on and was ready to go. The only thing left was the ride up to 14,000. They loaded the \"twin otter\" up with people, two AFF students (Pat and I) and our main and reserve jump masters. Two tandem jumpers and their jumpmasters and two cameramen for the tandem jumpers, plus a couple veteran jumpers; So about 15 people and all. At 10,000ft they opened the door and out the Tandem people went. Once they were out they closed the door and up the plane headed for 14k.\n\nNow I was super surprised at how calm I was. I totally wasn't scared. I figured I would be terrified, but I wasn't. I was just going over all the things I had to do once I got out of the plane. The only time I was \"hesitant\" and that's not to say I was afraid either, I just was taken aback a little, a moment of pause if you will; was when they cranked that door back open at 14,000 feet. It was a little chilly. When that cold hit me, I was like.. \"Yeeesh.. what am I doing?\" But that feeling went away as soon as it came, and I was ready to go.\n\nI got up in the doorway with the two jumpmasters that were going to go out the door with me and looked out at the world, really, really far below. I yelled to my left JM,\n\n\"Ready left?\" I yelled to my left Jumpmaster\n\nHe yelled back, \"Okay!\"\n\n\"Ready right?\" I said to the other.\n\n\"Okay!\", He said with a big smile.\n\nAt which point my brain said.. \"uh.. excuse me.. what are you about to do?\" Muhahahaha too late brain, because, with a 1,2,3.. we're already out the door!\n\nI didn't arch enough when I went out the door and we did a gentle tumble over backwards to look at the plane flying away. Now at the time I thought my jumpmasters did this on purpose because it was a very cool site. But in reality it was because I wasn't arched enough. My left JM gave me the arch sign and I arched as hard as I could and we were good to go from then on.\n\nIt took me maybe two or three seconds to un-overload my brain and remember that I had stuff to do. I can see why many people freak out at this point, the sensory overload comes at you fast and hard, and there is NO getting around it. It is a completely foreign environment and the ground is coming up fast.\n\nOnce I got my brain back on track, I did my heading and what they called the circle of awareness. I looked around and realized where we were and that everything was okay. I checked my altimeter and yelled it out to my left JM. He gave me a thumbs up. I yelled it out to my right JM and he gave me the same. (Come to find out they were both shocked that they actually heard me. Falling at 160 miles an hour makes a lot of noise, as a general rule you don't hear anything but the scream of the passing wind.) I then did three practice touches to my pull-chute to make sure I could actually find it when the time came. Then once that was don I checked altimeter again and yelled it out. Then I had about 5 seconds to enjoy the view before it was time to wave off and pull my chute. At 6,400 ft things went a little wrong but nothing big.\n\nAt 6,000 ft you are supposed to lock on to your altimeter and then \"wave off\" at 5,500ft. at which point you pull your chute. I went to do this and waved my hands just in time to whack my right jumpmaster in the hand. He was about to give me the \"pull chute\" sign when I hit him. Normally you don't wave off until 5,500 feet and pull sometime there after before you hit 4,500 ft. But we were FAR away from the dropzone because of both wind and that we were the last ones to leave the plane, he wanted me to pull sooner so I could get all the way back to the dropzone. No biggie really. It scared me when I hit him because at that point I noticed that the two jumpmasters were having a conversation over my back (using eye and hand gestures). They both agreed that we needed to pull a little sooner or we would have a long walk ahead of us. When I whacked my right JM, he jerked away from me so as to get out of the way. Well this scared me because of the look on his face and I thought I had done something wrong. I of course hadn't but at the time I was worried I had. I didn't know what he wanted me to do and so I just decided, \"when in doubt, pull it out.\" I reached to pull my chute. At which point I accidentally grabbed my JM's altimeter instead of the pullchute.. hehe whoops.. But I got the chute out and about 3 seconds later I was under a lovely canopy.\n\nThat's when everything slowed down to a speed that was much easier to process. I made sure the canopy was good and released my toggles. (The things you use to steer the chute with) I steered around for a while and did a lot of S-turns. I knew that my JM's had misjudged and that I was going to over shoot the DropZone by quite a bit, so I S-turned like a mad dog to try to cut some of my altitude down while not losing ground. The wind was blowing at 25 miles an hour though so I knew I was going to miss the DZ by a bit.\n\nAt 500 ft, I was RIGHT over the runway. And the PLANE LANDED UNDER ME!!! That was kind cool. I turned back and forth a bit more and then settled in on a landing zone. (The whole world is a landing zone by the way).. The landing was what I feared the most. I thought it was going to be bad. It wasn't though. I was a bit canted so I didn't land standing up. I was going to try to but I figured instead of risking in I would just do a PLF and be done with it. (Parachute Landing Fall.. basically you fall down instead of trying to land on your feet) It was nice and gentle. I got up and had a big smile on my face. I was about half a mile away from the LZ. Pat, the guy that went with me, landed about 3 miles away.. hehe\n\nI walked back in and we talked about it. My jumpmasters said I did an excellent job and that I could come back any time to fly with them. That made me feel good. They also told me that they were shocked that they actually heard me because that just doesn't happen. My voice was quite hoarse the next day.\n\nI don't think I had as much fun as those that went tandem because I was too busy thinking about all the stuff I had to do to not die. Where as the tandem flyer is just along for the ride and can have fun.\n\nI also think that no matter what you should have to do a tandem jump first. I think that those that do tandem first will have the experience necessary to NOT freak out on the way out the door.\n\nIt was an interesting first trip and I plan to go again this weekend. I don't think I am \"hooked\" but I did enjoy it.\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2004-01-02-t-mobiles-stellar-service.md","url":"/t-mobiles-stellar-service/","relative_path":"_posts/2004-01-02-t-mobiles-stellar-service.md","id":"/t-mobiles-stellar-service","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"T-Mobile's Stellar Service","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2004-01-02 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"t-mobiles-stellar-service","ext":".md"},"url":"/sky-diving/","relative_path":"_posts/2004-12-21-sky-diving.md","id":"/sky-diving","collection":"posts","excerpt":"I got to do something that was literally above and beyond the range of the word cool.

No sir, I hopped out of bed.\n\nI drove to my friend, Pat's house and picked him up. Soon, we were off. We headed to the drop-zone and only stopped for about 20 minutes to pick up some food. Once we got there we started to fill out a bunch of paperwork, the basic, \"Our lawyer is bigger than your lawyer\" stuff. Once everyone was there we all went into a classroom and began the lessons.\n\nI won't bore you with the detail's here but the class wasn't as good as it should have been. They really should have drilled things in more than they did. At one point in the class I was quite confused and was getting nervous because of my confusion. Eventually I got it all and knew what I had to do. I wasn't \"comfortable\" with everything because we only went over it for 5 hours, but I figured I got it. Looking back on it, that 5 hour course should have been stretched out over several days. (but then they do call it Accelerated free fall. It's accelerated alright.. sheesh)\n\nThe winds were blowing hard that day. The gusts were up to 28 miles an hour, holding around 22. They put us on hold for quite a while. Eventually we got to go up, I think they just gave up on waiting because they wanted to get us out of an airplane before we forgot everything. Again looking back on this, they should have waited.\n\nEventually I got suited up and get my chute on and was ready to go. The only thing left was the ride up to 14,000. They loaded the \"twin otter\" up with people, two AFF students (Pat and I) and our main and reserve jump masters. Two tandem jumpers and their jumpmasters and two cameramen for the tandem jumpers, plus a couple veteran jumpers; So about 15 people and all. At 10,000ft they opened the door and out the Tandem people went. Once they were out they closed the door and up the plane headed for 14k.\n\nNow I was super surprised at how calm I was. I totally wasn't scared. I figured I would be terrified, but I wasn't. I was just going over all the things I had to do once I got out of the plane. The only time I was \"hesitant\" and that's not to say I was afraid either, I just was taken aback a little, a moment of pause if you will; was when they cranked that door back open at 14,000 feet. It was a little chilly. When that cold hit me, I was like.. \"Yeeesh.. what am I doing?\" But that feeling went away as soon as it came, and I was ready to go.\n\nI got up in the doorway with the two jumpmasters that were going to go out the door with me and looked out at the world, really, really far below. I yelled to my left JM,\n\n\"Ready left?\" I yelled to my left Jumpmaster\n\nHe yelled back, \"Okay!\"\n\n\"Ready right?\" I said to the other.\n\n\"Okay!\", He said with a big smile.\n\nAt which point my brain said.. \"uh.. excuse me.. what are you about to do?\" Muhahahaha too late brain, because, with a 1,2,3.. we're already out the door!\n\nI didn't arch enough when I went out the door and we did a gentle tumble over backwards to look at the plane flying away. Now at the time I thought my jumpmasters did this on purpose because it was a very cool site. But in reality it was because I wasn't arched enough. My left JM gave me the arch sign and I arched as hard as I could and we were good to go from then on.\n\nIt took me maybe two or three seconds to un-overload my brain and remember that I had stuff to do. I can see why many people freak out at this point, the sensory overload comes at you fast and hard, and there is NO getting around it. It is a completely foreign environment and the ground is coming up fast.\n\nOnce I got my brain back on track, I did my heading and what they called the circle of awareness. I looked around and realized where we were and that everything was okay. I checked my altimeter and yelled it out to my left JM. He gave me a thumbs up. I yelled it out to my right JM and he gave me the same. (Come to find out they were both shocked that they actually heard me. Falling at 160 miles an hour makes a lot of noise, as a general rule you don't hear anything but the scream of the passing wind.) I then did three practice touches to my pull-chute to make sure I could actually find it when the time came. Then once that was don I checked altimeter again and yelled it out. Then I had about 5 seconds to enjoy the view before it was time to wave off and pull my chute. At 6,400 ft things went a little wrong but nothing big.\n\nAt 6,000 ft you are supposed to lock on to your altimeter and then \"wave off\" at 5,500ft. at which point you pull your chute. I went to do this and waved my hands just in time to whack my right jumpmaster in the hand. He was about to give me the \"pull chute\" sign when I hit him. Normally you don't wave off until 5,500 feet and pull sometime there after before you hit 4,500 ft. But we were FAR away from the dropzone because of both wind and that we were the last ones to leave the plane, he wanted me to pull sooner so I could get all the way back to the dropzone. No biggie really. It scared me when I hit him because at that point I noticed that the two jumpmasters were having a conversation over my back (using eye and hand gestures). They both agreed that we needed to pull a little sooner or we would have a long walk ahead of us. When I whacked my right JM, he jerked away from me so as to get out of the way. Well this scared me because of the look on his face and I thought I had done something wrong. I of course hadn't but at the time I was worried I had. I didn't know what he wanted me to do and so I just decided, \"when in doubt, pull it out.\" I reached to pull my chute. At which point I accidentally grabbed my JM's altimeter instead of the pullchute.. hehe whoops.. But I got the chute out and about 3 seconds later I was under a lovely canopy.\n\nThat's when everything slowed down to a speed that was much easier to process. I made sure the canopy was good and released my toggles. (The things you use to steer the chute with) I steered around for a while and did a lot of S-turns. I knew that my JM's had misjudged and that I was going to over shoot the DropZone by quite a bit, so I S-turned like a mad dog to try to cut some of my altitude down while not losing ground. The wind was blowing at 25 miles an hour though so I knew I was going to miss the DZ by a bit.\n\nAt 500 ft, I was RIGHT over the runway. And the PLANE LANDED UNDER ME!!! That was kind cool. I turned back and forth a bit more and then settled in on a landing zone. (The whole world is a landing zone by the way).. The landing was what I feared the most. I thought it was going to be bad. It wasn't though. I was a bit canted so I didn't land standing up. I was going to try to but I figured instead of risking in I would just do a PLF and be done with it. (Parachute Landing Fall.. basically you fall down instead of trying to land on your feet) It was nice and gentle. I got up and had a big smile on my face. I was about half a mile away from the LZ. Pat, the guy that went with me, landed about 3 miles away.. hehe\n\nI walked back in and we talked about it. My jumpmasters said I did an excellent job and that I could come back any time to fly with them. That made me feel good. They also told me that they were shocked that they actually heard me because that just doesn't happen. My voice was quite hoarse the next day.\n\nI don't think I had as much fun as those that went tandem because I was too busy thinking about all the stuff I had to do to not die. Where as the tandem flyer is just along for the ride and can have fun.\n\nI also think that no matter what you should have to do a tandem jump first. I think that those that do tandem first will have the experience necessary to NOT freak out on the way out the door.\n\nIt was an interesting first trip and I plan to go again this weekend. I don't think I am \"hooked\" but I did enjoy it.\n","previous":{"next":{"next":{"path":"_posts/2005-01-01-ambivalent-about-people.md","url":"/ambivalent-about-people/","relative_path":"_posts/2005-01-01-ambivalent-about-people.md","id":"/ambivalent-about-people","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Ambivalent about people","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2005-01-01 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"ambivalent-about-people","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2004-12-21-sky-diving.md","output":null,"content":"I got to do something that was literally above and beyond the range of the word cool. I got to jump out of an airplane at 14,000 ft.\n\nMost people that do that sort of thing go tandem. Meaning they harness themselves to the front of some expert before they jump out of a plane so that all they have to do is enjoy the ride. It's a lot of fun that way because all you have to do is fall.\n\nI on the other hand, am a bit too big to go tandem so I had to leave the plane on my own. I took a 5-hour class (that lasted for 8 hours) that taught the finer points of falling out of an airplane. They go over how you fall and how everything works so you can function on the way out. They teach you how to land and how to react once out of the plane. They also go over emergency procedures and what to do if something isn't working correctly. You are all alone out there when you do the accelerated free fall class and it was important to really get this stuff. I went over it and over it and over it..\n\nI must say that I am amazed that I had the presence of mind to actually do that stuff upon exiting the plane. The sensory overload is beyond compare. You leave the airplane and enter a world that is just indescribable. The world is rushing up at you at 160 miles an hour. The wind is deafening. The view is spectacular. The drop zone suddenly seems very, very small. Something that was very large while standing there was suddenly the size of a postage stamp, and the spot you were supposed to hit was the size of an \"o\". Literally, it was about the size of that o.\n\nIt was great fun! I was in complete awe with the whole experience.\n\nThe day started for me at 5:30 am.

It rules.\n\nIt can do full internet among other things.. but I noticed I wasn't getting full internet through my service provider, T-Mobile.. I had \"Unlimited T-Zones\" from them which is an added $4.99 a month which they SAY will give you full internet (or it used to).. Well suddenly I'm not getting internet access but I can get WAP access..\n\nSo I call them.\n\nShe explains to me that I need the T-Mobile Internet option that is an additional $19 a month. It gives me T-Zones and Internet. So, so much for unlimited t-zones that used to give me the internet.. Gotta love them changing shit without telling me..\n\nBut that isn't what bothers me..\n\nWhat bothers me is that the chick that I was talking to flat out lied to me about activation times, and the reason the way they are.\n\nIn order to get the T-Mobile Internet, she has to flip some switches and it takes 2-48 hours for them to \"propagate\".. But since T-Mobile Internet has T-Zones included, I can drop the Unlimited T-Zones service. So I do.\n\nIt dropped absolutely INSTANTLY. I was on the phone with her, and when she said, \"Okay I'll do that now, it can take 2-48 hours to stop working\" I clicked refresh in the phone browser and was given an access denied prompt.\n\nI explained to her that it suddenly stopped working, and she said \"oh well I guess it can happen quicker, and it was only a chance that it could take 2-48 hours\".. So either she lied to me about the amount of time it takes to disconnect, or she simply didn't know and was making it up.\n\nSo, you can disconnect me instantly, but it takes 48 hours to connect me? Why?\n\n\"Well it has to propagate a bunch of information to your phone\"\n\nBut it disconnected instantly, isn't it a matter of flipping a bit and it connects the other one instantly?\n\n\"No it has to propagate.\"\n\nWhat's that mean? What does it have to do? It stands to reason that if you can instantly disconnect, then you can instantly connect.\n\n\"It has to update your account to reflect the changes and it has to send information to your phone.\"\n\nBut you just updated my account to discontinue T-Zones and it was instant, why does connecting take 48 hours?\n\n\"Cause it has to propagate...\"\n\n{ You keep using that word, I don't think it means what you think it means.. }\n\n\"Put simply, it has to send information to your phone so it knows to use the Internet\"\n\nSo, T-Mobile is pushing information to my phone? My phone already knows how to use the internet, it was doing it. It's a pretty high tech device I got here. And when she said \"put simply\" that pissed me off.. she was talking down to me the whole damn conversation. I was asking very straight forward questions that she didn't have an answer for.\n\n\"Yes your phone has to be updated by the server to make this T-Mobile Internet work.\"\n\nThat's a complete fabrication.\n\nI just said whatever and hung up.. So now I have no internet on my remote device while their system does some magical shit to connect me that she could have done right there..\n\nIt irritates me.. and frankly this is amazingly poor customer service..\n\nT-Mobile used to be a damn good mobile carrier, but their service is starting to suck. Their customer service people lie, are generally rude, and talk down to you.\n\nTheir phone service is starting to suffer lately too. My new home site gets full bars Verizon and Cingular, but nothing from T-Mobile.. (My phone can ping all towers in the area and tell me the signal strength..)\n\nOkay at this point I was sufficiently pissed enough about this (especially after reliving it as I wrote it down) that I called back..\n\nI got another lady who was very nice and actually admitted to me that she just didn't know and that she probably received the same training that the first girl got..\n\nShe put me on hold and went and talked to someone over in the \"PDA queue\" about this problem .\n\nShe came back and said that the expert that she talked to, who was an expert on my phone, said that the GPRS connection is instant.. But the other services and features have to be turned on by the \"webmaster\"..\n\nSo in order to get email it has to be setup.\n\nI explain to her that I had email working just fine. I was able to read my emails through the GPRS system which has now been turned off to me, and all of these connections are through GPRS whether to WAP or to WEB.. She gave me the phone equivalent of a blank stare and put me back on hold.\n\nI swear these tech support people are the virtual deer in headlights of technology..\n\nSO then I get a third woman, who was an escalation of the first two I suppose.. She (a very butch sounding \"She\" btw) told me that the engineers handle all this stuff and that the reason it takes so long to get something implemented was because of the way billing works.. It has to go through the billing account system and that system delays any feature you added.\n\nExample you HAVE T-Zones, you remove T-zones.. it will be instant. You add it back, and boom..48 hours. She called these provisional delays.. It basically takes into account that everything is added in queue order.. so anyone who asked for a thing before you gets it before you..\n\nMy main point of contention is, if you have me on the fuckin phone.. do it right then..\n\nWhat's funny is that this chick actually admitted to me that at one time it the T-Zones system worked just fine for web browsing but they \"fixed\" that. And they angered and lost a lot of customers due to that fix.\n\nThis third person while nice and knowledgeable wasn't able to help me either.. She went through every setting in my phone..\n\nEverything was \"Correct\", shockingly.\n\nSo, she shucked me off to the advanced PDA group in England who know more about \"fancy foreign phones\". Back on hold .. yeah..\n\nAt this point, I have been on the phone for over an hour and have to pee so bad I am floating.. I have a co-worker come over and sit on hold while I go throw a line..\n\n20 minutes later I get someone else.. Not in England, but rather Seattle.. Not even close..\n\nAnother woman. She didn't know a thing about my phone, and had to go look it up.\n\nWe went through the exact same routine the previous person did.. checked all my settings and had me reboot the phone and try again.. (\"Did ya try rebooting?\")\n\nThis woman basically told me that everyone I talked to previously were idiots. She said that any phone that has full HTML browser used to be able to get full access with the T-ZONEs.. so they \"fixed that\".. Information I already had..\n\n\"Having a smart phone with full HTML wasn't something they planned for.. and since it was just changed we can set it up and we wont know if its working.. \"\n\nLong story short, they can't help me.. Nothing she did made a damn bit of difference. She said though that even though it can show up as provisioned (enabled), it may not be actually working.. Nice.. Cause, it aint..\n\nIn the end they TRIED to help but either their knowledge was lacking, or the system they are working with is so technical it borders on magic..\n\nOh and another interesting note, ONLY port 80 is blocked on WAP. Everything else works fine. So basically, you pay an extra $15 a month to have that port opened .. What a fucking scam.\n\nI'll give them 48 hours. Then I call another carrier.\n","previous":{"next":{"path":"_posts/2004-01-02-t-mobiles-stellar-service.md","url":"/t-mobiles-stellar-service/","relative_path":"_posts/2004-01-02-t-mobiles-stellar-service.md","id":"/t-mobiles-stellar-service","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"T-Mobile's Stellar Service","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2004-01-02 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"t-mobiles-stellar-service","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2004-01-02-ebay-bidding.md","output":null,"content":"__if you don't have the cash, don't bid on the item__\n\nI am not financial wiz-kid here. Infact, ever since my girl friend moved in, I have pushed all financial responsibility off on to her. Hey it's what she does for a living, and she's pretty good at it. That aside, I can still tell you at any given point, what I can afford; infact, I'm willing to bet I could give you an accurate guess plus or minus a hundred dollars of exactly what I can afford at any time.\n\nI'm not talking about groceries or something, I'm talking about big stuff.. Like several hundred or several thousand dollar items. Big dollar items, trips, vehicles, guns..etc..\n\nWe recently put our Toyota MR2 Turbo up for sale on eBay. It's a good car, and we figured it would fetch ~$5k or so, our target price was $5,500. We listed the initial price of the vehicle at $5000, with that target in mind.\n\nThe final bid winner had managed to get it for $6k. Great, we thought. We made more than we wanted, and yet its still a good price as there are others on there (worse versions of the car) that go for more.\n\nTwo days later, which already told me something was up, I get a call from him saying that he can't pay for the car. Not only can he not afford the $6000 price that HE BID FOR, he couldn't even afford the OPENING BID of $5000.\n\n\"I talked to my bank and the most I could get was $4900\".\n\nWhy the hell did he bid on the car in the first place?!\n\nIf you can't afford something, then don't bid on it. I mean its okay to dream. There are lots of cool toys and things out there that I would love to own, but I know I couldn't possibly afford.. But I don't go bid on them just because I want them.. If I know I can't afford something, I'm not going to place my name in the hat as a possible buyer. All that does is screw up the entire auction system.\n\nHe initiated the conversation by saying \"We have a bit of a problem\"... A bit?! You, by bidding, signed a promissory agreement in good faith to pay the amount you bid. Now you're going back on that promise. Infact, you had no business making that promise in the first place. \"WE\" don't have a bit of a problem, YOU have a problem as you're financially a moron, and I have a problem with you bidding on things you can't afford.\n\nFirst of all, this tells me that you didn't even think about this you mindless simpleton. You should know based on your income alone, how much you can afford. I mean if you can't foot half the bill out of pocket why did you bid at all? The car is a 13 year old vehicle and you expected a bank to give you 100% of the loan?! Why on Earth would they do that? Have you no idea how money works at all?\n\nSecondly, because of the way eBay works, I was charged to list the vehicle in the first place. So not only are you not paying me the money that you promised to pay, but you just cost me money and wasted my time. Not only do you have so much debt that $6k is evidently way out of reach for you, but you also managed to cost me $50.\n\nI may not be a financial wiz, but clearly some people are much much worse...\n\nThe winning bidder, who's email address and phone number I have so nicely left off of here, has promised to pay the $50 listing fee. Now, the question is, should I leave negative feedback on him via eBays feedback system or should I let this one slide.\n\nMy thoughts on the matter are that I should not only leave the negative feedback, but report him to eBay. To me this is an abuse of the system. He bid an amount that he knew he didn't have. He didn't have the opening bid amount, and couldn't even get financed for the opening bid amount, not even mentioning the final bid amount that he won.\n\nPersonally, I feel it is my duty as a seller on eBay to report this guy, this way it might save someone else from the hassle.\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2003-01-02-i-hate-advertising.md","url":"/i-hate-advertising/","relative_path":"_posts/2003-01-02-i-hate-advertising.md","id":"/i-hate-advertising","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"I hate advertising...","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2003-01-02 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"i-hate-advertising","ext":".md"},"url":"/ebay-bidding/","relative_path":"_posts/2004-01-02-ebay-bidding.md","id":"/ebay-bidding","collection":"posts","excerpt":"I am not financial wiz-kid here.
