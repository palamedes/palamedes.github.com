Even now I get a lump in my throat thinking about it.  Yesterday my long time pet, companion and friend died.  She had been suffering for a while, and it was finally time to stop that suffering and let her rest.  A hard day indeed.\n\nShortly after I started working for C3 Communications in 2000, I was approached by a co-worker who was looking for a good home for a cat that she had recently adopted.   She was getting married and the new man in her life was \"allergic\" to cats.  The way she said it implied to me that he was just a jerk and was being mean to the cat, and she wanted to find another home for it -- instead of finding another man.\n\nI told her I was interested in the critter and was more than happy to take a look to see if we would get along.  Well, she had brought the cat that same day, and had it in the back seat of her car in a carrier.  Again, I got the impression it was me, or the pound.\n\nUpon seeing this scared little kitty in a cat carrier, all sad and dejected, I was more than happy to give her a good home.\n\nI took the rest of the day off and took her home.  She was completely silent the whole way home, looking this way and that not knowing what was going on, clearly terrified.\n\nWhen I got the carrier open she just sat in the back of it refusing to come out.  I knew better than to reach in and try to get her too.  I just let her sit there with the door open and spoke softly to her letting her know it was okay and she could come out whenever she wanted.\n\nEventually I just went about my business around the house.  I put some food and water down, and put the catbox where she could see them all.\n\nIt took several hours, but eventually she came out and disappeared under the bed. hehe   I honestly didn't see her for 2 weeks after that.  Every morning before going to work I would put some more catfood down, clean out the box and leave.  I'd come home and there'd be food missing so I knew she ate..  =)  She was very scared and clearly had a rough time in her previous home.\n\nThere was no way for me to make her understand clearly that I wasn't ever going to hurt her other than to let her adjust in her own time.\n\nShe eventually did of course, and we were pretty fast friends.  Eventually she was in my lap pretty much always demanding some lovin, which I was more than happy to provide.\n\nI don't know exactly when it happens, but at some point in our relationships with our pets they go from being \"Eh a cat\", to a very important member of our family, a loved one.   So of course it was very hard news to hear when I found out she was sick.\n\nShe was diagnosed with a hyperthyroid problem and given 6 months to live.  We kept her on the medication the doctors gave us and even purchased special expensive food to feed her which was supposed to help her get better.\n\nIt didn't.  In fact, nothing seemed to help.  She was wasting away before our eyes, getting sicker and sicker.   The final visit to the vet proved the medications and what not we had her own weren't doing anything and in fact the thyroid problem was an ancillary problem.\n\nBabie had some how contracted <a href=\"http://www.vet.cornell.edu/fhc/brochures/felv.html\" target=\"_blank\">feline leukemia</a>, an extremely nasty virus that is basically \"kitty HIV\".  I don't know where or how she got it as our cats never go outside.  But now we have to get the other two <a href=\"/my-cats-diary/\" target=\"_blank\">captives</a>.. er cats checked and make sure they are okay.   I seriously hope they don't have anything -- this sucked.\n\nBy the end, babie was hurting.  She was weak and unable to lift her head.  She had lost a ton of weight, and couldn't keep any food or water down.  She was having a very hard time breathing due to the leukemia and her liver had likely developed cancer.  Her body was failing her.  All around she wasn't her usual happy self, and it broke my heart.\n\nAt 2:45ish on Thursday Jan 17, 2008 she died.\n\nBabie was an awesome cat.  She was easily the best kitty friend I have ever had, and I will sorely miss her.\n\nShe was an extremely gentile soul, that just wanted to love and be loved by all those around her.  Very sweet animal that I will never forget.   Babie I love you very much, and I hope your life was a good one.  You'll be missed.\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2008-01-11-wow-i-hate-you.md","url":"/wow-i-hate-you/","relative_path":"_posts/2008-01-11-wow-i-hate-you.md","id":"/wow-i-hate-you","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Wow, I hate you!","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-01-11 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"wow-i-hate-you","ext":".md"},"url":"/my-kitty-babie/","relative_path":"_posts/2008-01-18-my-kitty-babie.md","id":"/my-kitty-babie","collection":"posts","excerpt":"Yesterday was a hard day.

Okay I don't actually.. In fact, I think the game play is pretty good.  The social aspect is pretty good, the combat is pretty good, raiding can be fun, and it's a nice mindless game to play with your friends and loved ones..  In fact, just about everything is pretty good.\n\nExcept one major detail -- the game looks like ass.\n\nBut I get ahead of myself.  I have played <a href=\"/past-mmos-i-have-played/\">MMO games for a long time</a>, so I have a pretty darn good idea of what a good game is.  And just about across the board, World of Warcraft (WoW) has done some very nice things.  I think blizzard did a great job in capturing everything that makes a game fun to play.   Since my wife has decided to play the game again, that meant I was going to have to play the game too.. (I swear Scott Kurtz has a <a href=\"http://www.pvponline.com/2008/01/08/wow-frau/\">camera in my house</a>..)\n\nNow there are a lot of people (especially in EVE) that hate WoW just because they need something to hate.  They hate everything about it, and when you complain that they are doing something stupid they will tell you to; \"Go back to Wow!\"  Or some such rubbish..  These people are the opposite of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fanboy\" target=\"_blank\">fanboi's</a> in that they hate WoW with a fervor and passion unparalleled (and unexplained.)  I'm not one of those folks.\n\nFor some reason, however, I have never liked WoW and up until very recently I didn't know why.   I thought the reason was due to the stylistic game play (read: the cartoony nature.)  But since I love TFC2 that can't be the reason -- It's all cartoony.  But finally, after much thought and reasoning I have come to the real culprit.\n\nThe game just looks terrible.  It's extremely low-poly and frankly, unimpressive.  I am not one that usually puts graphics before gameplay, but they have the game play.. Now fix the graphics!  Wheels should have more than 5 sides..  I mean seriously, this game looks like it was put together with lego blocks.\n\nI realize its an older game, but so is EVE and they are constantly working on their graphics.. (<a href=\"http://www.eve-online.com/trinity/index.html\">Trinity</a> = good!)\n\nIt really needs an overhaul.  At this point it looks extremely dated -- sorta like looking at EQ1 now compared to EQ2 or any other game for that matter.  WoW is of the EQ1 generation.  It's time for an upgrade.\n\nI realize the game was designed with the lowest common denominator in mind with regards to hardware -- and maybe that's smart and the reason its as popular as it is.. but I personally don't like it.\n\nEspecially considering my game rig.. I have a game machine that can play Crysis at 1680x1050 with ALL the settings maxed and still get 20+ fps.  (Try it some time.. If you get more than 10 fps you're doing good -- I still prefer to turn stuff off and play it at lower settings.. anything lower than 40 fps seems laggy to me..)  So it seems wasteful to play WoW with all that hardware.. heh..\n\nSo that's it.. That's my big problem with the game.. It's too low-poly at this day an age.  It just seems klunky.  And I'm not keen on the klunk.\n","previous":{"next":{"path":"_posts/2008-01-11-wow-i-hate-you.md","url":"/wow-i-hate-you/","relative_path":"_posts/2008-01-11-wow-i-hate-you.md","id":"/wow-i-hate-you","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Wow, I hate you!","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-01-11 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"wow-i-hate-you","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2008-01-07-eve-being-bad-and-tools.md","output":null,"content":"So as some of you know I have been playing the hell out of Eve..

I'm trying to focus on what should have been done so that new games like <a href=\"http://www.fl-tw.com/Infinity/\" target=\"_blank\">Infinity Earth</a> don't fall into the same trap.  I just hope the new games will listen and take note.\n\nFirst let me start by saying that I think Eve Online is a beautiful game and can be fun once you get DEEP into the game, and it's certainly challenging. However a new players experience is terrible and doesn't give any clues as to what is to come later, more over the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_versus_environment\" target=\"_blank\">PVE</a> aspect of the game is down right bad which means new players are forced to deal with experienced players in a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_versus_player\" target=\"_blank\">PVP</a> realm often resulting in repeated trouncings with no end in sight.\n\nIs it any wonder that many new players leave pretty quick?  Think of what kind of power house this game would be if it's new player experience was just a bit better..\n\nThe biggest problem with Eve online is it's learning curve, it's steep to the point of making Mt. Everest look small. Combine the learning curve with the complete lack of \"newbie\" game and the fact that it's PVE content is nearly non-existent and you have the core issues.\n\nA new player to Eve is immediately overwhelmed with the UI and all the possible features and functions in the game.  <a href=\"http://www.ccpgames.com/\" target=\"_blank\">CCP</a> has done a pretty good job creating a tutorial for the new players to follow, but even so once the tutorial is over you're very much thrown to the wolves.  And trust me when I say, the players in Eve aren't forgiving or kind in their treatment of others.  If you cross the wrong line you'll find yourself on the wrong end of some pretty big guns..\n\nAs I said above, the PVE aspect of Eve is nearly non-existent and this is a damn shame.  They could have done so much with this.  Look at the major (read: successful/profitable) MMO games out there and see that all of them have vast loads of PVE content.  Some of that very simple content could benefit the game as a whole greatly. I think Eve and CCP could do a lot of justice to the game by taking a realistic look at what the other MMO games are doing and maybe implementing some of it.  I'm not suggesting changing any of the end game PVP stuff.. (So calm down guys..)\n\nOur goal as gamers is to have fun, their goal as a game producer is to make money.  Chasing away players due to complexity and other issues is bad and ultimately doesn't meet either goal, thus implementing some of the stuff that makes WoW or EQ2 popular might help the game.\n\nNow I just crossed a line.  I am sure the rabid pack of Eve players that do actually read this are now frothing at the mouth because of what I just suggested..  It seems at every turn the hard core gamers out there bash games like WoW and EQ2 for being too easy or being too \"care bear.\"  Its very easy for these extremists to badmouth WoW without looking at all the things they are doing right.  Personally I don't care for WoW either, but I atleast can recognize some of the things that the game has done right and what other games can take from it.\n\nGiving the players something easy to do will help the people become in tune with their character.   It will help them build a sense of ownership and pride in there online persona, as well as foster a desire to achieve greater and greater goals.  In other words, it makes them want to keep playing the game.\n\nRealistically, in Eve the PVE content should give the players something to do while waiting for their skills to train up.  There only other option really is to mine rocks in high security space, which is tough with all the farmers -- Not to mention down right boring.\n\nThe real \"fun\" of Eve doesn't come until Much MUCH later in the game.  And new players don't get to experience any of that for months.  But just like a new player to EQ2 doesn't get to raid gods their first day, neither should Eve players.  The difference is EQ2 players CAN raid smaller boss mobs, or at least get some idea of what a raid would be like at lower levels.  Eve players have no clue what its like to play with the big boys until its too late and they are \"egging\" their way back to a home base.  Trust me, this isn't fun -- it's frustrating as hell.\n\nYou don't want to piss off your players -- it hurts your bottom line.\n\nI fear that so many new games that are being created by small developers, like Infinity Earth, are so against creating what they call a \"WoW clone\" that they aren't willing to even look at some of the stuff that WoW did right.\n\nI'm all for thinking outside the box, and implementing things others haven't tried, but to dismiss everything that WoW did simply because \"its been done\" or because they don't want to be identified with something that the big boys did, is folly.\n\nGames should be fun. More over to be successful they should be fun for the majority, not just a niche market.  An example was <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega_%281989_computer_game%29\" target=\"_blank\">Omega</a>.  Omega was a programmers game in that to truly play it and know how to play it, you had to know how to program.  Talk about niche!  I thought it was HUGELY fun, and thought it would take off like a rocket.  Of course it didn't do that well because most people didn't know how to write the code required to program the tanks..  Sure it was fun to me, but not to the majority -- the majority rule, don't lose sight of that.\n\nPeople want to play games because they are fun..  I think its the responsibility of developers to give them fun games to play.  And in Eve's case it would be easy!  You could add low level content, without altering the rest of the game at all.\n\nI wonder why they wont..\n","previous":{"next":{"path":"_posts/2007-11-05-games-should-be-fun.md","url":"/games-should-be-fun/","relative_path":"_posts/2007-11-05-games-should-be-fun.md","id":"/games-should-be-fun","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Games","Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Games should be fun","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2007-11-05 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"games-should-be-fun","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2007-10-30-space-submarine.md","output":null,"content":"I have been playing the hell out of Silent Hunter 3 recently.  I have always enjoyed good submarine games, which can be tough to do in an age of few good submarine games heh..    The Silent Hunter games are excellent however, and I very much look forward to getting Silent Hunter 4 -- which is out already, but I've been forbidden to purchase since Christmas is coming up.. (  Aaawwww.. But maaaa!!!  )\n\nI'll be a good little boy and wait though.. *taps foot*\n\n####Space Submarine!\n\nWhile playing any game, I just about always think about how to improve the game, or how the game could be thought about in different ways..  Not only am I looking for emergent game play ideas, but how the game play in general can be applied to other genre of games -- as well as how the game itself could be improved.\nIt occurred to me while playing Silent Hunter 3 that this same game could be applied to space combat..  Most likely in the \"far distant future\" you're going to be attacking space ships in the very same manner that submarines have been doing it since the 30's.  Sneak up.. Launch weapon.. Run away and hope you don't die.. hehe\n\nMost weapons in the future will have a range far beyond what we have today, and even today our weapons reach far beyond what we can see or perceive physically..    So why do all space games out there use very short ranged laser weaponry that must be manually aimed?  Why do we look through windows at the vast black searching with our eyes for our enemy to shoot?  It's silly..\n\nDon't even get me started on the \"short ranged laser\"...  But why wouldn't we be fighting more from a position of stealth in which our ship does the majority of the work?  You start hidden waiting for target or trolling for a target from a position of stealth.. Once it shows up, you select the target through whatever targeting devices we use then push the \"launch\" button and go back to ground.  The concept of a first person space shooter isn't a good one just due to the size of space in general as well as the relative speed and size of objects in it.  Two \"fighter craft\" in space might never see one another, never mind actually mingling and fighting one another.\n\nAnyone who knows me and my game dreams knows this is a radical step away from my previous position.. I used to think it was a good idea to continue the first person space game genre, but maybe thats why they haven't done well..  It doesn't make sense - and unlike fantasy games in which things don't have to make any kind of sense (P1:\"Uh hows this work?!\"  P2:\"Magic\"  P1:\"Oh okay..\") most scientific/futuristic games will need to be based on some kind of reality or its just \"fantasy in the future.\"\n\nThe more I think about it, the more I think that small fighter craft in a space situation will be of very limited use.  I think you're going to see a lot more hot battleship on battleship action.  Or if I were to make a game this is how it would be..\n\n####Silent Hunter 3\n\nSomething I think SH3 needs is the ability for players to play the destroyers.. I love playing a sub and sinking ships, but it would be equally cool to play the sub hunter..  Or even play multiplayer, sub versus sub or sub versus destroyer..\n\nIt does have a multiplayer aspect, but I have no idea how it works.\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2007-10-11-gutsy-windows-and-portal.md","url":"/gutsy-windows-and-portal/","relative_path":"_posts/2007-10-11-gutsy-windows-and-portal.md","id":"/gutsy-windows-and-portal","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Gutsy > Windows and Portal","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2007-10-11 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"gutsy-windows-and-portal","ext":".md"},"url":"/space-submarine/","relative_path":"_posts/2007-10-30-space-submarine.md","id":"/space-submarine","collection":"posts","excerpt":"I have been playing the hell out of Silent Hunter 3 recently.  I have always enjoyed good submarine games, which can be tough to do in an age of few good submarine games heh..    The Silent Hunter games are excellent however, and I very much look forward to getting Silent Hunter 4 -- which is out already, but I've been forbidden to purchase since Christmas is coming up..","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Space Submarine!","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2007-10-30 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"space-submarine","ext":".md"},"url":"/games-should-be-fun/","relative_path":"_posts/2007-11-05-games-should-be-fun.md","id":"/games-should-be-fun","collection":"posts","excerpt":"I fear that so many new games that are being created by small developers, like Infinity Earth, are so against creating what they call a \"WoW clone\" that they aren't willing to even look at some of the stuff that WoW did right.","draft":false,"categories":["Games","Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Games should be fun","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2007-11-05 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"games-should-be-fun","ext":".md"},"url":"/eve-being-bad-and-tools/","relative_path":"_posts/2008-01-07-eve-being-bad-and-tools.md","id":"/eve-being-bad-and-tools","collection":"posts","excerpt":"So as some of you know I have been playing the hell out of Eve..
