(  Aaawwww.. But maaaa!!!  )\n\nI'll be a good little boy and wait though.. *taps foot*\n\n####Space Submarine!\n\nWhile playing any game, I just about always think about how to improve the game, or how the game could be thought about in different ways..  Not only am I looking for emergent game play ideas, but how the game play in general can be applied to other genre of games -- as well as how the game itself could be improved.\nIt occurred to me while playing Silent Hunter 3 that this same game could be applied to space combat..  Most likely in the \"far distant future\" you're going to be attacking space ships in the very same manner that submarines have been doing it since the 30's.  Sneak up.. Launch weapon.. Run away and hope you don't die.. hehe\n\nMost weapons in the future will have a range far beyond what we have today, and even today our weapons reach far beyond what we can see or perceive physically..    So why do all space games out there use very short ranged laser weaponry that must be manually aimed?  Why do we look through windows at the vast black searching with our eyes for our enemy to shoot?  It's silly..\n\nDon't even get me started on the \"short ranged laser\"...  But why wouldn't we be fighting more from a position of stealth in which our ship does the majority of the work?  You start hidden waiting for target or trolling for a target from a position of stealth.. Once it shows up, you select the target through whatever targeting devices we use then push the \"launch\" button and go back to ground.  The concept of a first person space shooter isn't a good one just due to the size of space in general as well as the relative speed and size of objects in it.  Two \"fighter craft\" in space might never see one another, never mind actually mingling and fighting one another.\n\nAnyone who knows me and my game dreams knows this is a radical step away from my previous position.. I used to think it was a good idea to continue the first person space game genre, but maybe thats why they haven't done well..  It doesn't make sense - and unlike fantasy games in which things don't have to make any kind of sense (P1:\"Uh hows this work?!\"  P2:\"Magic\"  P1:\"Oh okay..\") most scientific/futuristic games will need to be based on some kind of reality or its just \"fantasy in the future.\"\n\nThe more I think about it, the more I think that small fighter craft in a space situation will be of very limited use.  I think you're going to see a lot more hot battleship on battleship action.  Or if I were to make a game this is how it would be..\n\n####Silent Hunter 3\n\nSomething I think SH3 needs is the ability for players to play the destroyers.. I love playing a sub and sinking ships, but it would be equally cool to play the sub hunter..  Or even play multiplayer, sub versus sub or sub versus destroyer..\n\nIt does have a multiplayer aspect, but I have no idea how it works.\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2007-10-11-gutsy-windows-and-portal.md","url":"/gutsy-windows-and-portal/","relative_path":"_posts/2007-10-11-gutsy-windows-and-portal.md","id":"/gutsy-windows-and-portal","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Gutsy > Windows and Portal","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2007-10-11 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"gutsy-windows-and-portal","ext":".md"},"url":"/space-submarine/","relative_path":"_posts/2007-10-30-space-submarine.md","id":"/space-submarine","collection":"posts","excerpt":"I have been playing the hell out of Silent Hunter 3 recently.  I have always enjoyed good submarine games, which can be tough to do in an age of few good submarine games heh..    The Silent Hunter games are excellent however, and I very much look forward to getting Silent Hunter 4 -- which is out already, but I've been forbidden to purchase since Christmas is coming up..","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Space Submarine!","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2007-10-30 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"space-submarine","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2007-10-11-gutsy-windows-and-portal.md","output":null,"content":"At work I use just about nothing but Linux.  Even my IBM issued laptop is dual-bootable..

It’s in a quiet little area in a very tasteful building not hurting anyone.\n\nAnd it seems that about 3 times a week there is a pack of 10 or so college age people standing out side quietly protesting.  All of them wearing the same obnoxious t-shirt with anti-abortion rhetoric and wearing tape over their mouths acting like they were the “baby” that was killed.   All quietly standing next to their BMW’s and Jags saying that you’re a bad person and should be prisoned for murder.\n\nMy initial thought was, what the hell don’t these children have anything better to do?!\n\nBut the more I thought about it the more it pissed me off.

More than half of the protesters were men!\n\nYou’ve never been pregnant while standing between a rock and a hard place..  Yet you have the raw audacity to stand there and judge a persons action, when you yourself haven’t had to make that choice?!  Fuck you!\n\nThey say that “adoption” is an option, yet none of them are familiar with the process or the foster care system.

A painfully clear case of “do what I say, not what I do.”\n\nAt the end of the day, or whenever they get tired – these kids all get back in their BMW’s and jags that mommy and daddy are paying for and drive home.

Why do people think they have a right to judge the actions of others, especially when they haven’t had to make those decisions themselves?  I mean it’s very easy to stand back and armchair the world.. but when you actually live it life gets a little more complex.

Did you talk to them?\n\n\n<i class='icon-star'></i> Jason - Monday, Aug 13th 2007 at 12:57 pm\n\n        Sorry but “Don’t judge me, while I judge others” isn’t a valid argument. That dog don’t hunt.\n\n        Granted, I’m judging people.  But I’m judging those who are themselves judging others in a very public and extremely obnoxious way. That in my mind opens them up to comment. They want to be viewed and commented about, or they wouldn’t be standing on the street corner with their shirts and attitudes.\n\n        Where as they are judging those who want to be left alone and not judged. People who are going through a tough time and probably have made a very hard decision — or in some way need help (Not public scrutiny.)\n\n        And no.. I have not spoken to them. Today as I went by there was only one woman, and she was very young. While she may have gone through what others have, the 7 men (I drove by at lunch to check) have most likely not come up preggers..\n\n        Either way.. my last point stands.. You don’t get to tell people what to do, you don’t get to pressure people to do what you want..\n\n        Additional — I also find it extremely amusing that the very first comment, not even an hour after I posted, was from a holy roller pro-lifer who’s likely more interested in telling others how they should live than actually living themselves ( He left a link. ). Get off your box man — leave people alone.\n\n\nRon - Tuesday, Oct 16th 2007 at 1:30 pm\n\n        I don’t undrstand your argument or how you can have an objection to these young people. They are desperately trying to save the lives of babies who are powerless to help themselves from being murdered. How can you or anyone else justify the slaughter of these children for the sake of what the parent is going through?\n\n        I have heard of all the arguments of why abortion is just OK to do, but just because there is a law that says you can do it, doesn’t mean that the act is diminished. It is still child murder, and all the justifications in the world can’t change that. You can’t just wish your atrocities away into the cornfield!\n\n\n<i class='icon-star'></i> Jason - Tuesday, Oct 23rd 2007 at 10:15 am\n\n        “Murder” is the crime of unlawfully killing a person especially with malice aforethought. (http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/murder)\n\n        For there to be “murder”, there must be a crime.\n\n        Since abortion is not illegal, it is not a crime — therefore it isn’t murder.\n\n        However, I’ll play your little game. If abortion is murder — what punishment should we hand out to the woman? How much time should she do for that murder?\n\n        The death penalty? Or if she’s answerable to God, then why make it illegal in the first place? I’m fairly certain that God doesn’t need your help. If this is a matter between the woman and God why are you sticking your nose in to it at all? (Oh right.. Christianity.. I forgot..)\n\n        The problem I have is that you’re willing to fight to outlaw abortion, but not fight to ensure good and effective birth control to help prevent conception in the first place. You don’t fight for easy free access to neonatal care, or quicker adoption programs or any other benefit to expecting mothers who don’t want the child — underprivileged or otherwise.\n\n        You could easily advocate all manner of good things from the government to better this situation which you call murder, but you don’t.\n\n        All you give a shit about is the fetus while its in utero. Once it gets its first cry suddenly in your eyes its just another poverty stricken criminal-in-waiting whelpling born of a morally questionable whore and an anonymous baby-daddy that’s stealing money from welfare, not giving back to society and dragging the rest of us down.\n\n        Your narrow minded morality tale doesn’t impress me — you’re only true interest is forcing all of us to live by your mores by any means. Religious fascists by any other name.\n\n        How many children have you adopted?","previous":{"next":{"path":"_posts/2007-08-13-how-dare-you-judge.md","url":"/how-dare-you-judge/","relative_path":"_posts/2007-08-13-how-dare-you-judge.md","id":"/how-dare-you-judge","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"How dare you judge!","layout":"post","tags":["Abortion"],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2007-08-13 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"how-dare-you-judge","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2007-08-12-mental-note-boiling-oil-hot.md","output":null,"content":"<a rel='lightbox' class=\"fancybox pull-right\" title=\"Burnt Fingers\" href=\"/images/2007/08/owwie.jpg\"><img alt=\"Burnt Fingers\" src=\"/images/2007/08/owwie.jpg\" /></a>\n\nSo I got it into my head today that I'd like to make some falafel.  I like the stuff, and hadn't had any in a while.   I had a mix all done up and upon sliding off a patty into the oil, it splashed.  Right on to my fingers.  And not a little splash either.  This was a big bunch of oil that went all over the place.  I was unamused.\n\nMostly because it took the skin off two of my fingers.. =(  Not exactly what I would call a \"fun time\".\n\nI thought about going to the emergency room but really there was no point..  They would do the same thing for me that I was already doing.. keep it clean, keep it dry.. cover it with some sterile gauss etc..
