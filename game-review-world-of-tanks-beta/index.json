They used to be \"the\" game genre, but over the years as time and technology has marched forward they have largely started to decline in  favor of more real time strategy games and first person shooters.\n\nSo when <a href=\"http://www.wgames.biz/\" target=\"_blank\">W!Games</a> introduced Greed Corp a modern turn based strategy game with a very clever land collapsing mechanic to the PC late last year, I was pretty excited..  This was the first I had heard of it even though the  PS3 and XBox players had access to it since last February.  I don't follow the console games market at all so it was completely new to me.\n\nI have to admit I really like it.. The best part about this game is that it's actually a game.. Meaning it focuses on game play not wizbang special effects or graphics..  I really feel that this is a shining example of good game design and salute the W!Games folks.\n\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2011/01/Greed-Corp-screen.jpg\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"Greed Corp screen\" src=\"/images/2011/01/Greed-Corp-screen-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Greed Corp screen\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Greed Corp screen</span></a>\n\nThe fun of the game comes in the form of playing on the edge of a very delicate balancing act between harvesting resources to fuel your expansion and preserving that land to stay alive.   The games landmass is divided up into these hex tiles that you take control of in an attempt to control the whole map.  Each hex tile has a level associated with it and each time your harvester harvests it's tile and the six around it, that level is lowered one.\n\nIf you lower it too far, it breaks up and falls away.  You can (and often do) intentionally crack up some key spots to  help direct the flow or to cause a cascade of tile collapses in order to win the game..  It's a lot of fun and can be deceptively challenging..\n\nIt's not your standard 4X (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate) game like Masters of Orion or Civilization..   In that there is no exploration, you see the entire map from get go and know exactly what your opponents are doing all the time.   Nor does it have that rock/paper/scissors mechanic in it's pieces where each piece has an advantage over some other piece, but a weakness to a third as so many modern games try to do..\n\nTo me this is one of those \"chess\" games..  You have a one primary game piece that has a very specific movement rule-set.  And you have a 3 possible placeable pieces (buildings) with no movement mechanic but affect the map or gameplay in some way.  That's it.  Simple.  Elegant.\n\nThe rest of it is about playing your opponent by out maneuvering them with your few pieces..  It's brilliant..\n\nI give this game 4.5 out of 5.  The only reason it's not a 5 is because the of the camera angle and zoom level.  I can't help but feel the camera angle is too steep, and pine for the ability to zoom out a bit..  But other than that I can honestly say well done guys.. Great stuff.\n","collection":"posts","url":"/game-review-greed-corp/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2011-02-09-15-mac-book-pro.md","collection":"posts","url":"/15-mac-book-pro/","path":"_posts/2011-02-09-15-mac-book-pro.md","id":"/15-mac-book-pro","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"15\" Mac Book Pro!","layout":"post","tags":["Apple"],"image":"/images/2011/01/apple_mbp_core_i5_8.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2011-02-09 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"15-mac-book-pro","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2011-01-15-game-review-greed-corp.md","excerpt":"I have always liked turn based strategy games..

The only issue with the Sony is it's age and it has a really small screen.. But still!  These are expensive machines and they should last.  It was completely unacceptable to me that the Lenovo's didn't even come close.  And most people I have talked to who had Lenovo's of their own had a similar experience.\n\n{% include ad.primary.html %}\n\nSo, I splurged and purchased a 15\" Mac Book Pro.  This is a really nice piece of hardware.. I'm quite excited about it..  Everyone that I know that has a mac book is happy with it and they all say that hardware wise it's easily the best laptop you can buy.. I have to agree.. It's a rock solid laptop..\n\nI went through and got all the software on it that I wanted and got my LAMP setup working so I can do some development on there..etc..  Good stuff..\n","collection":"posts","url":"/15-mac-book-pro/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2011-02-09-15-mac-book-pro.md","collection":"posts","url":"/15-mac-book-pro/","path":"_posts/2011-02-09-15-mac-book-pro.md","id":"/15-mac-book-pro","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"15\" Mac Book Pro!","layout":"post","tags":["Apple"],"image":"/images/2011/01/apple_mbp_core_i5_8.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2011-02-09 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"15-mac-book-pro","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2011-02-21-game-review-world-of-tanks-beta.md","content":"<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2011/02/tiger_ii_1024_768.jpg\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Tiger II\" src=\"/images/2011/02/tiger_ii_1024_768-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Tiger II\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Tiger II</span></a>\n\nWhen I heard a buddy of mine tell me that he was playing a game called \"World of Tanks\" I thought he was kidding.. I thought he was making some reference to \"tanking\" in World of Warcraft or something..  But no, he was serious..\n\nWho on Earth would name their game this?!  Well.. Apparently Wargaming.net and BigWorld Technology that's who..\n\nWorld of Tanks is a real first person shooter style game currently in open beta in which you get to drive tanks, tank destoyers and/or self propelled guns around fairly large maps all with the goal of mass destruction, mayhem and general killing of your fellow man.  Booyah!  Who wouldn't like that right?\n\nI have to admit, its a lot of fun but has a lot of flaws that I'm concerned about..  But first the good!\n\nThey have a LOT of tanks.  Light, Medium, Heavy, Tank Destroyers of every flavor and even Artillery if that's your speed..  You're thrust on to one of a dozen or more (not sure how many all told) maps with 15 people per side and you fight it out until your team is the last standing..\n\nYou can currently choose from Russian, German and USA when buying your tanks and you're never restricted to a side.  You can easily go up the Russian tech tree and the German tech tree at the same time.  By the time of release they have stated that they will have fleshed out the USA tree (its kinda broken at the moment and missing tank destroyers entirely), as well as adding French and Japanese tanks.  I even heard rumor of British.. Awesome..\n\nIt's a lot of fun, and I liken it to a really slow first person shooter..  Unlike most FPS style games you go go go, but you have no choice but to go slower in this game as tanks don't move that fast, barrels are slow to traverse, reload times are slow..etc..  And if you do manage to get in a light tank and zip up to the front line you're likely to die very quickly as.. well.. light tanks are light for a reason..   So you have to play this game kinda slowly and carefully.. That's appealing..\n\nThe games themselves are usually 5 to 15 minutes long and can never go beyond 15 minutes, plus if you do die early you can always bail on that game to start up another one while waiting for that game to finish.. So you're never just sitting there waiting for the next round like some FPS games..  If at the end of 15 minutes there isn't a resolution (all dead on one side or the flag is captured) then it's a draw.  I have played over 300 games and this has happened once.\n\nThe objects on the terrain are completely destructible.. (for the most part)  Don't like that house in your way?  Drive through it!! Or shoot it.. And it's free to play!!  Even after release they have a free to play model but it will be slow going for you.. but still free is good..\n\nBut.. now we get to the bad.. You see the game has a lot of problems too that are starting to effect my fun:\n\n__Completely Silent Devs__:  As with any game, the developers are non-existent.  We hear nothing as players and all our pleas, prayers and questions go unanswered.   This is the unfortunate trend in the gaming industry that has been going on for years and all it does is piss off customers.  Mums the word and that blows.\n\nThey also appear to have an extremely slow development cycle or their iterations are very long as patches seem to come rather infrequently.. If ever..\n\n__Zero Control__:  Currently there is absolutely no way to choose which map you want to play on.  When you queue for a battle you're thrown into the first available \"room\" with a random group of people in random vehicles, on a random map.  Okay Fight! This sucks and leads to a lot of issues where you're in a room with people that have tanks 4 and 5 tiers above yours.   Many times have I felt like I brought a bb-gun to a bazooka-fest because I happened to be in my T3 tank going against t8 behemoths..\n\nI want to be able to to decide what vehicle I'm in for what map.  If I'm in a heavy city fight, I don't want to bring artillery..etc..   I want to be able to switch guns to suit the situation and you just can't, you have to make due with whatever you're given.\n\nI want to be able to see who/what is queueing so that I can decide to stay or go.. If I know I'm not going to be effective in a battle due to being in too small a kit then I need the ability to opt-out.  But you can't, you're in it for the fight until your tank gets turned into a smoking hole.. and it will..  This isn't fun..\n\n__Physics Model__:  The game has a very poor if non-existent physics model, as such it's possible sometimes to hang a tank off a cliff and fire down the slope in such a way as to defy gravity..  In reality the tank would take a tumble.. This is silly and makes it impossible in some cases to be safe down a hill from someone.  Where as you should be safe because they can't dip their gun low enough.. but.. no.\n\n__Graphics Engine__:  The graphics engine itself is a tad dated.. It's not bad looking by any stretch of the meaning, but it's not the most modern thing either, add to that the pretty bad memory leak issues they can't seem to plug and things start to fall apart fairly quickly.. Frustrating having to restart the client every hour or so..\n\n__Damage Model__:  There seems to be some pretty big issues with the damage model right now too..  Huge tanks firing Volkswagen sized shells at smaller tanks quite often do no damage what so ever.. This is frustrating and leads to a lot of odd damage issues where you should be able to kill a tank 2 or 3 tiers your junior but can't because for some reason they are impenetrable..  This is frustrating as hell..\n\n__Tank Tracks__:  It seems that the tank tracks for any given vehicle are made of papier-mâché in that if you even bump another tank the damn things fall off and you have to just sit there and wait for your crew to fix it..  This is extremely annoying to say the least..\n\n__Line of Sight__:  Easily the biggest issue though is the line of sight system they have implemented by which tanks constantly just up and vanish..  Unlike other first person shooters where people are always rendered as they run around the map and you have to spot them yourself.. this game has opted for a weird system by which enemy tanks are completely invisible (read: not rendered by the graphics engine) if your \"crew can't see them\"..\n\nTHIS SUCKS.  This sucks because half the time you could be and often are a very short distance from an enemy tank that you would otherwise absolutely see.. but just doesn't get rendered.. At all.  Until suddenly POP! There he is!  And it seems to be completely random for each individual..\n\nSo, for you the enemy tank is invisible.. But for him he sees you just fine, and is shooting you..  So you're dying but you can't see the enemy tank that's shooting you mere feet away because your crew has their heads up their asses..\n\nThis is an absolute game breaker!  They have to fix this or the game will be doomed to fail.  And such an easy fix too!  Render everyone, all the time.  Done.\n\n__Grouping__:  The game is \"free to play\" and as such anyone can download it and get in but in order to group up with a friend you have to have paid for the \"Premium\" access.  This sucks as it doesn't allow players to introduce a friend to it for free.. This is dumb of them, they need to allow anyone to group, free player or paid player.\n\n__Not an MMO__: They tout the game as an MMO but it's very much not.  It's more along the lines of \"Counterstrike with Tanks\".  The largest battle you can have (the only battle you can have at this time) is a 15 on 15 battle, and 30 people aint massive.  It's just a FPS, most FPS games are pay-once/play free games.   This game smacks of a company trying to get people to pay a monthly subscription for a really small amount of content that other games give away for free.  Imagine if Counterstrike, or Call of Duty tried to charge a monthly fee..\n\n__Match Making__:  The match making system is broken right now in that I'm currently, as I type this, in a game where a tier 3 vehicle is on the same map as a tier 9 vehicle..  That's completely silly as the tier 3 Marder can't do anything to a tier 9 IS-4..\n\nI mean come on, that's not even remotely fair to the Marder player..  The biggest gun the Marder can fit fires an average pen of 158 points of damage using the expensive ammo that costs real money (118 for the free stuff that people are actually using) where as the armor on the IS-4 is 160..  So the Marder actually can't do anything against this tank..    I'm pretty sure the Marder player didn't join the game in the hopes of being cannon fodder..\n\nThe match tier range needs to be limited to one or two levels at most.. 3 at the absolute outside.. otherwise you end up with a bunch of folks on the map who can't contribute to the match at all, but count as slots for that team.   Whats more is we have that one tier 3, and two tier 4s on our team where as the opposite team's lowest tiered tank is a tier 6..   Guess which side won..\n\n__Balance__:  I realize fully that due to the sheer volume of different tanks and vehicles its going to be near impossible to balance the tanks.  And at some point you have to accept that certain tanks suck when compared directly with other specific tanks..etc..  But it really seems that all of the American tanks, suck horribly.. Where as all of the Russian tanks are pure liquid awesome..  And it's a Russian made game.. Hmmmm..\n\nIt's telling when the biggest gun my American tier 6 heavy can fit is a 76mm gun that does an average damage of 115 points, and the Russian tier 6 heavy can fit a 152mm gun that does 700 points!!!!!!   I mean come on!  That's not even subtle, it's to the point of being silly.. (Note: this gun is often called the \"derp gun\" in game cause its just stupid..)\n\nIt may be completely realistic and historically accurate (American tanks during this period did very much suck..)but at some point \"fun\" has to step in and be the guide..  This isn't a tank simulator and isn't meant to be..\n\n__Pay-to-Win__:  The other issue I fear for is the Free-to-play model that they are employing..  The economic model they have chosen to use is confusing and messy.  There are multiple types of money to be used, money you buy and money you earn. You can convert money you buy into money you earn but both are used to buy things.  Some objects in the store are purchased with the earned money, some with the purchased money.  Experience is the same way in that there is earned experience for a given thing, and free experience that you can use on anything.  You can of course convert experience on a given thing to free experience but it costs money that you purchase.. etc..\n\nIt's confusing to a new player even though I understand it now it still boggles a little. I honestly don't know why they didnt just go to one type of money, one type of experience.. Done.   And to boot the cost for the gold money that you buy is too high compared to what you get, as well as them gouging you to convert experience to free experience.. it's almost like they see that as a cash cow and are trying like hell to get folks to fork over the $$$..\n\nPlus now they have added things like special tanks and ammo that you can purchase, and while it's kind of expensive it's nearly twice as good as the free stuff..  So sure, it's free to play but you're extremely gimped if you don't pony up the cash..  Paid (Premium) players get 50% more experience, access to WAY better ammo and tanks as well as gear and experienced crew..etc.. basically they have tried to monetize the game into a pay-to-win model where by the player who buys the most stuff will win every time.   Not cool.\n\nOkay enough.. you get the idea.. And having said all that, I still like the game.. It's still fun!  But I wonder how much of that is just due to a novelty value of getting to drive around in tanks and blow shit up..\n\nI just don't see how it's going to hold peoples attention in the long run.  The issues are out weighing the fun slowly.  The line of sight issue is easily the biggest with people just popping into and out of existence.. they have to get that one fixed or this game will be DOA..\n\nMy biggest concern at this point is that I just don't see how they are going to get all the issues fixed in time for their release at the beginning of next month.\n","collection":"posts","url":"/game-review-world-of-tanks-beta/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2011-03-06-game-review-night-sky.md","collection":"posts","url":"/game-review-night-sky/","path":"_posts/2011-03-06-game-review-night-sky.md","id":"/game-review-night-sky","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Game Review: Night Sky","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2011/03/nicalis-nightsky-pc-ss-01.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2011-03-06 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"game-review-night-sky","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2011-02-21-game-review-world-of-tanks-beta.md","excerpt":"When I heard a buddy of mine tell me that he was playing a game called \"World of Tanks\" I thought he was kidding..

But for him he sees you just fine, and is shooting you..  So you're dying but you can't see the enemy tank that's shooting you mere feet away because your crew has their heads up their asses..\n\nThis is an absolute game breaker!  They have to fix this or the game will be doomed to fail.  And such an easy fix too!  Render everyone, all the time.  Done.\n\n__Grouping__:  The game is \"free to play\" and as such anyone can download it and get in but in order to group up with a friend you have to have paid for the \"Premium\" access.  This sucks as it doesn't allow players to introduce a friend to it for free.. This is dumb of them, they need to allow anyone to group, free player or paid player.\n\n__Not an MMO__: They tout the game as an MMO but it's very much not.  It's more along the lines of \"Counterstrike with Tanks\".  The largest battle you can have (the only battle you can have at this time) is a 15 on 15 battle, and 30 people aint massive.  It's just a FPS, most FPS games are pay-once/play free games.   This game smacks of a company trying to get people to pay a monthly subscription for a really small amount of content that other games give away for free.  Imagine if Counterstrike, or Call of Duty tried to charge a monthly fee..\n\n__Match Making__:  The match making system is broken right now in that I'm currently, as I type this, in a game where a tier 3 vehicle is on the same map as a tier 9 vehicle..  That's completely silly as the tier 3 Marder can't do anything to a tier 9 IS-4..\n\nI mean come on, that's not even remotely fair to the Marder player..  The biggest gun the Marder can fit fires an average pen of 158 points of damage using the expensive ammo that costs real money (118 for the free stuff that people are actually using) where as the armor on the IS-4 is 160..  So the Marder actually can't do anything against this tank..    I'm pretty sure the Marder player didn't join the game in the hopes of being cannon fodder..\n\nThe match tier range needs to be limited to one or two levels at most.. 3 at the absolute outside.. otherwise you end up with a bunch of folks on the map who can't contribute to the match at all, but count as slots for that team.   Whats more is we have that one tier 3, and two tier 4s on our team where as the opposite team's lowest tiered tank is a tier 6..   Guess which side won..\n\n__Balance__:  I realize fully that due to the sheer volume of different tanks and vehicles its going to be near impossible to balance the tanks.  And at some point you have to accept that certain tanks suck when compared directly with other specific tanks..etc..  But it really seems that all of the American tanks, suck horribly.. Where as all of the Russian tanks are pure liquid awesome..  And it's a Russian made game.. Hmmmm..\n\nIt's telling when the biggest gun my American tier 6 heavy can fit is a 76mm gun that does an average damage of 115 points, and the Russian tier 6 heavy can fit a 152mm gun that does 700 points!!!!!!   I mean come on!  That's not even subtle, it's to the point of being silly.. (Note: this gun is often called the \"derp gun\" in game cause its just stupid..)\n\nIt may be completely realistic and historically accurate (American tanks during this period did very much suck..)but at some point \"fun\" has to step in and be the guide..  This isn't a tank simulator and isn't meant to be..\n\n__Pay-to-Win__:  The other issue I fear for is the Free-to-play model that they are employing..  The economic model they have chosen to use is confusing and messy.  There are multiple types of money to be used, money you buy and money you earn. You can convert money you buy into money you earn but both are used to buy things.  Some objects in the store are purchased with the earned money, some with the purchased money.  Experience is the same way in that there is earned experience for a given thing, and free experience that you can use on anything.  You can of course convert experience on a given thing to free experience but it costs money that you purchase.. etc..\n\nIt's confusing to a new player even though I understand it now it still boggles a little. I honestly don't know why they didnt just go to one type of money, one type of experience.. Done.   And to boot the cost for the gold money that you buy is too high compared to what you get, as well as them gouging you to convert experience to free experience.. it's almost like they see that as a cash cow and are trying like hell to get folks to fork over the $$$..\n\nPlus now they have added things like special tanks and ammo that you can purchase, and while it's kind of expensive it's nearly twice as good as the free stuff..  So sure, it's free to play but you're extremely gimped if you don't pony up the cash..  Paid (Premium) players get 50% more experience, access to WAY better ammo and tanks as well as gear and experienced crew..etc.. basically they have tried to monetize the game into a pay-to-win model where by the player who buys the most stuff will win every time.   Not cool.\n\nOkay enough.. you get the idea.. And having said all that, I still like the game.. It's still fun!  But I wonder how much of that is just due to a novelty value of getting to drive around in tanks and blow shit up..\n\nI just don't see how it's going to hold peoples attention in the long run.  The issues are out weighing the fun slowly.  The line of sight issue is easily the biggest with people just popping into and out of existence.. they have to get that one fixed or this game will be DOA..\n\nMy biggest concern at this point is that I just don't see how they are going to get all the issues fixed in time for their release at the beginning of next month.\n","collection":"posts","url":"/game-review-world-of-tanks-beta/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2011-02-09-15-mac-book-pro.md","collection":"posts","url":"/15-mac-book-pro/","path":"_posts/2011-02-09-15-mac-book-pro.md","id":"/15-mac-book-pro","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"15\" Mac Book Pro!","layout":"post","tags":["Apple"],"image":"/images/2011/01/apple_mbp_core_i5_8.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2011-02-09 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"15-mac-book-pro","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2011-02-21-game-review-world-of-tanks-beta.md","content":"<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2011/02/tiger_ii_1024_768.jpg\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Tiger II\" src=\"/images/2011/02/tiger_ii_1024_768-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Tiger II\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Tiger II</span></a>\n\nWhen I heard a buddy of mine tell me that he was playing a game called \"World of Tanks\" I thought he was kidding.. I thought he was making some reference to \"tanking\" in World of Warcraft or something..  But no, he was serious..\n\nWho on Earth would name their game this?!  Well.. Apparently Wargaming.net and BigWorld Technology that's who..\n\nWorld of Tanks is a real first person shooter style game currently in open beta in which you get to drive tanks, tank destoyers and/or self propelled guns around fairly large maps all with the goal of mass destruction, mayhem and general killing of your fellow man.  Booyah!  Who wouldn't like that right?\n\nI have to admit, its a lot of fun but has a lot of flaws that I'm concerned about..  But first the good!\n\nThey have a LOT of tanks.  Light, Medium, Heavy, Tank Destroyers of every flavor and even Artillery if that's your speed..  You're thrust on to one of a dozen or more (not sure how many all told) maps with 15 people per side and you fight it out until your team is the last standing..\n\nYou can currently choose from Russian, German and USA when buying your tanks and you're never restricted to a side.  You can easily go up the Russian tech tree and the German tech tree at the same time.  By the time of release they have stated that they will have fleshed out the USA tree (its kinda broken at the moment and missing tank destroyers entirely), as well as adding French and Japanese tanks.  I even heard rumor of British.. Awesome..\n\nIt's a lot of fun, and I liken it to a really slow first person shooter..  Unlike most FPS style games you go go go, but you have no choice but to go slower in this game as tanks don't move that fast, barrels are slow to traverse, reload times are slow..etc..  And if you do manage to get in a light tank and zip up to the front line you're likely to die very quickly as.. well.. light tanks are light for a reason..   So you have to play this game kinda slowly and carefully.. That's appealing..\n\nThe games themselves are usually 5 to 15 minutes long and can never go beyond 15 minutes, plus if you do die early you can always bail on that game to start up another one while waiting for that game to finish.. So you're never just sitting there waiting for the next round like some FPS games..  If at the end of 15 minutes there isn't a resolution (all dead on one side or the flag is captured) then it's a draw.  I have played over 300 games and this has happened once.\n\nThe objects on the terrain are completely destructible.. (for the most part)  Don't like that house in your way?  Drive through it!! Or shoot it.. And it's free to play!!  Even after release they have a free to play model but it will be slow going for you.. but still free is good..\n\nBut.. now we get to the bad.. You see the game has a lot of problems too that are starting to effect my fun:\n\n__Completely Silent Devs__:  As with any game, the developers are non-existent.  We hear nothing as players and all our pleas, prayers and questions go unanswered.   This is the unfortunate trend in the gaming industry that has been going on for years and all it does is piss off customers.  Mums the word and that blows.\n\nThey also appear to have an extremely slow development cycle or their iterations are very long as patches seem to come rather infrequently.. If ever..\n\n__Zero Control__:  Currently there is absolutely no way to choose which map you want to play on.  When you queue for a battle you're thrown into the first available \"room\" with a random group of people in random vehicles, on a random map.  Okay Fight! This sucks and leads to a lot of issues where you're in a room with people that have tanks 4 and 5 tiers above yours.   Many times have I felt like I brought a bb-gun to a bazooka-fest because I happened to be in my T3 tank going against t8 behemoths..\n\nI want to be able to to decide what vehicle I'm in for what map.  If I'm in a heavy city fight, I don't want to bring artillery..etc..   I want to be able to switch guns to suit the situation and you just can't, you have to make due with whatever you're given.\n\nI want to be able to see who/what is queueing so that I can decide to stay or go.. If I know I'm not going to be effective in a battle due to being in too small a kit then I need the ability to opt-out.  But you can't, you're in it for the fight until your tank gets turned into a smoking hole.. and it will..  This isn't fun..\n\n__Physics Model__:  The game has a very poor if non-existent physics model, as such it's possible sometimes to hang a tank off a cliff and fire down the slope in such a way as to defy gravity..  In reality the tank would take a tumble.. This is silly and makes it impossible in some cases to be safe down a hill from someone.  Where as you should be safe because they can't dip their gun low enough.. but.. no.\n\n__Graphics Engine__:  The graphics engine itself is a tad dated.. It's not bad looking by any stretch of the meaning, but it's not the most modern thing either, add to that the pretty bad memory leak issues they can't seem to plug and things start to fall apart fairly quickly.. Frustrating having to restart the client every hour or so..\n\n__Damage Model__:  There seems to be some pretty big issues with the damage model right now too..  Huge tanks firing Volkswagen sized shells at smaller tanks quite often do no damage what so ever.. This is frustrating and leads to a lot of odd damage issues where you should be able to kill a tank 2 or 3 tiers your junior but can't because for some reason they are impenetrable..  This is frustrating as hell..\n\n__Tank Tracks__:  It seems that the tank tracks for any given vehicle are made of papier-mâché in that if you even bump another tank the damn things fall off and you have to just sit there and wait for your crew to fix it..  This is extremely annoying to say the least..\n\n__Line of Sight__:  Easily the biggest issue though is the line of sight system they have implemented by which tanks constantly just up and vanish..  Unlike other first person shooters where people are always rendered as they run around the map and you have to spot them yourself.. this game has opted for a weird system by which enemy tanks are completely invisible (read: not rendered by the graphics engine) if your \"crew can't see them\"..\n\nTHIS SUCKS.  This sucks because half the time you could be and often are a very short distance from an enemy tank that you would otherwise absolutely see.. but just doesn't get rendered..

This is dumb of them, they need to allow anyone to group, free player or paid player.\n\n__Not an MMO__: They tout the game as an MMO but it's very much not.  It's more along the lines of \"Counterstrike with Tanks\".  The largest battle you can have (the only battle you can have at this time) is a 15 on 15 battle, and 30 people aint massive.  It's just a FPS, most FPS games are pay-once/play free games.   This game smacks of a company trying to get people to pay a monthly subscription for a really small amount of content that other games give away for free.  Imagine if Counterstrike, or Call of Duty tried to charge a monthly fee..\n\n__Match Making__:  The match making system is broken right now in that I'm currently, as I type this, in a game where a tier 3 vehicle is on the same map as a tier 9 vehicle..  That's completely silly as the tier 3 Marder can't do anything to a tier 9 IS-4..\n\nI mean come on, that's not even remotely fair to the Marder player..  The biggest gun the Marder can fit fires an average pen of 158 points of damage using the expensive ammo that costs real money (118 for the free stuff that people are actually using) where as the armor on the IS-4 is 160..  So the Marder actually can't do anything against this tank..    I'm pretty sure the Marder player didn't join the game in the hopes of being cannon fodder..\n\nThe match tier range needs to be limited to one or two levels at most.. 3 at the absolute outside.. otherwise you end up with a bunch of folks on the map who can't contribute to the match at all, but count as slots for that team.   Whats more is we have that one tier 3, and two tier 4s on our team where as the opposite team's lowest tiered tank is a tier 6..   Guess which side won..\n\n__Balance__:  I realize fully that due to the sheer volume of different tanks and vehicles its going to be near impossible to balance the tanks.  And at some point you have to accept that certain tanks suck when compared directly with other specific tanks..etc..  But it really seems that all of the American tanks, suck horribly..

Ugh.. Seriously?!   My Desktop resolution is 5520x1200..  This game looks like a postage stamp by comparison forcing me to play it in the full screen mode which jacks up my other two monitors..  I really don't like this and seems an odd choice all things considered.\n\nThat's it!  There it is.. the only complaint I can find..   If you read my game reviews I can always find a lot of things to complain about.. but I got nothing else..\n\nAll in all I give this game a 4.5 out of 5 and say get it!  It's a lot of fun and considering how small a team put it together they deserve the money.  Yet another perfect example of how simple elegant game play will win over big budget massive game every time.  Take note big developers, game play wins!\n\nTo Nicklas Nygren and the <a href=\"http://nifflas.ni2.se/\" target=\"_blank\">Nifflas</a> crew I say thanks a lot!  This is a keeper..\n\n","collection":"posts","url":"/game-review-night-sky/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2011-03-06-game-review-night-sky.md","collection":"posts","url":"/game-review-night-sky/","path":"_posts/2011-03-06-game-review-night-sky.md","id":"/game-review-night-sky","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Game Review: Night Sky","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2011/03/nicalis-nightsky-pc-ss-01.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2011-03-06 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"game-review-night-sky","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2011-03-13-grid-computing-and-boinc.md","content":"<a href=\"http://boincstats.com/stats/boinc_user_graph.php?pr=bo&amp;id=05439a7a6a0f2499a04b1da317b68e1d\" target=\"_blank\" class='pull-right'><img title=\"BOINC Stats\" src=\"http://www.boincstats.com/signature/user_238192.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"325\" height=\"173\" /><br /><span>My BOINC Stats</span></a>\n\nI really like the idea of community computing, or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grid_computing\" target=\"_blank\">grid computing</a>..  I've always thought it was a damn good idea and I always try to leave one running. I mean think about all the wasted computer cycles that your machine could be using to do good things with when you're not around.\n\nEspecially if you set it up to be completely invisible like I do..  I never know its running because I have it setup to run only when my machine is idle, and I disable the screen saver portion of it in favor of just showing a blank screen.  Doing it this way I have generated over a hundred thousand points and turned in a lot of good results for them to chew on and I never even noticed.  Yay doing my part, by doing nothing.  Seriously it costs me nothing; why not?\n\nThe down side of my method is that it's so invisible that I didn't notice it hadn't been running for the last couple months.  I forgot to reinstall it when I formatted and reinstalled windows.  Woops.\n\nSo today I got BOINC reinstalled and set back up the way I like it and it's now chewing away at the bigger problems of life, the universe and everything.\n\nAnd since some will be curious, I typically do some World Community Grid projects (Help Conquer Cancer, Human Proteome Folding, FightAIDS@Home, Genome Comparison..etc), SETI@home Einstein@home, Docking@home and the MilkyWay@home stuff.  (See the graphic above)\n\nI have used the Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) since 2004.  And I used a very scientific method for picking it; It was the first one I heard of and it was the one doing SETI@Home.  Okay not so scientific but it's served me well (or rather I have served it well) for a while and I hope it's doing some good.\n\nNow-a-days, one of my main requirements is that they use the CPU and GPU to calculate results.   It seems right now the GPU calculation stuff is a tad underdeveloped or at least you have poor control over it.  I have two GPU's in my machine, but it only uses one.  Or says it only uses one, who knows how many it actually uses.  But one is better than none.  The Nvidia CUDA core calculations are way faster than CPU only.. like 10x faster..  If you don't use the GPU you're wasting your time.\n\nThis got me to thinking, are there better grid systems out there?   Do some deserve our computer cycles more than another?   Why?   What do you use?    Do you have a grid machine setup?  Why not?  I honestly can't think of a down side... Can you?\n\nOkay that's not true, I guess the major down side is your computer is always hyperactive.  It's never \"at rest\".  But is that a problem?  Computers aren't like people in that they don't rest.  A CPU using 10% of its processing power is effectively the same as a CPU using 100% of its processing power in all ways except one;  Heat.\n\nSo a computer that's chewing away at @Home stuff is going to be hotter than an idle machine.  And there will be a slight spike in bandwidth when transferring the files back and forth, but its hardly worth mentioning as these files are tiny.   So that's the two \"major\" downsides I can think of.\n\nThoughts?\n\nEdit: I swear to god I had more points than this at one time..
