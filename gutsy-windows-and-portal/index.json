It’s in a quiet little area in a very tasteful building not hurting anyone.\n\nAnd it seems that about 3 times a week there is a pack of 10 or so college age people standing out side quietly protesting.  All of them wearing the same obnoxious t-shirt with anti-abortion rhetoric and wearing tape over their mouths acting like they were the “baby” that was killed.   All quietly standing next to their BMW’s and Jags saying that you’re a bad person and should be prisoned for murder.\n\nMy initial thought was, what the hell don’t these children have anything better to do?!\n\nBut the more I thought about it the more it pissed me off.  And now all I can think is; how dare they?!\n\nThese kids are actually protesting the actions of people who are in very hard situations; situations that they themselves have NEVER been in.  More than half of the protesters were men!\n\nYou’ve never been pregnant while standing between a rock and a hard place..  Yet you have the raw audacity to stand there and judge a persons action, when you yourself haven’t had to make that choice?!  Fuck you!\n\nThey say that “adoption” is an option, yet none of them are familiar with the process or the foster care system. More over, all of them are out there saying you should do something that they themselves aren’t willing to do!  I assure you, none of those twenty-something’s have adopted a child.   A painfully clear case of “do what I say, not what I do.”\n\nAt the end of the day, or whenever they get tired – these kids all get back in their BMW’s and jags that mommy and daddy are paying for and drive home.  They haven’t a clue what others are going through or how hard their lives could be.\n\nI seriously don’t understand people..  Why do people think they have a right to judge the actions of others, especially when they haven’t had to make those decisions themselves?  I mean it’s very easy to stand back and armchair the world.. but when you actually live it life gets a little more complex.  Most of those decisions are very hard, and not easily made.\n\nPeople making those decisions sure as hell don’t need some snot nosed juvenile barely off their mothers tit to cast their trained opinions at them..\n\nUltimately it comes down to this;\n\n  * You don’t get to tell others what to do..\n  * You shouldn’t get to pressure people into doing what you want them to either..\n  * And you certainly don’t get to judge people who make actions contrary to your beliefs, especially when you yourself haven’t lived this situation..\n\n\n---\n\n####Legacy Comments\n\nJivinJ - Monday, Aug 13th 2007 at 12:34 pm\n\n        Aren’t you judging the actions of these protesters?\n\n        Aren’t you saying that they shouldn’t be doing what they are doing?\n\n        How do you know that none of the females protesting haven’t been pregnant? Did you talk to them?\n\n\n<i class='icon-star'></i> Jason - Monday, Aug 13th 2007 at 12:57 pm\n\n        Sorry but “Don’t judge me, while I judge others” isn’t a valid argument. That dog don’t hunt.\n\n        Granted, I’m judging people.  But I’m judging those who are themselves judging others in a very public and extremely obnoxious way. That in my mind opens them up to comment. They want to be viewed and commented about, or they wouldn’t be standing on the street corner with their shirts and attitudes.\n\n        Where as they are judging those who want to be left alone and not judged. People who are going through a tough time and probably have made a very hard decision — or in some way need help (Not public scrutiny.)\n\n        And no.. I have not spoken to them. Today as I went by there was only one woman, and she was very young. While she may have gone through what others have, the 7 men (I drove by at lunch to check) have most likely not come up preggers..\n\n        Either way.. my last point stands.. You don’t get to tell people what to do, you don’t get to pressure people to do what you want..\n\n        Additional — I also find it extremely amusing that the very first comment, not even an hour after I posted, was from a holy roller pro-lifer who’s likely more interested in telling others how they should live than actually living themselves ( He left a link. ). Get off your box man — leave people alone.\n\n\nRon - Tuesday, Oct 16th 2007 at 1:30 pm\n\n        I don’t undrstand your argument or how you can have an objection to these young people. They are desperately trying to save the lives of babies who are powerless to help themselves from being murdered. How can you or anyone else justify the slaughter of these children for the sake of what the parent is going through?\n\n        I have heard of all the arguments of why abortion is just OK to do, but just because there is a law that says you can do it, doesn’t mean that the act is diminished. It is still child murder, and all the justifications in the world can’t change that. You can’t just wish your atrocities away into the cornfield!\n\n\n<i class='icon-star'></i> Jason - Tuesday, Oct 23rd 2007 at 10:15 am\n\n        “Murder” is the crime of unlawfully killing a person especially with malice aforethought. (http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/murder)\n\n        For there to be “murder”, there must be a crime.\n\n        Since abortion is not illegal, it is not a crime — therefore it isn’t murder.\n\n        However, I’ll play your little game. If abortion is murder — what punishment should we hand out to the woman? How much time should she do for that murder?\n\n        The death penalty? Or if she’s answerable to God, then why make it illegal in the first place? I’m fairly certain that God doesn’t need your help. If this is a matter between the woman and God why are you sticking your nose in to it at all? (Oh right.. Christianity.. I forgot..)\n\n        The problem I have is that you’re willing to fight to outlaw abortion, but not fight to ensure good and effective birth control to help prevent conception in the first place. You don’t fight for easy free access to neonatal care, or quicker adoption programs or any other benefit to expecting mothers who don’t want the child — underprivileged or otherwise.\n\n        You could easily advocate all manner of good things from the government to better this situation which you call murder, but you don’t.\n\n        All you give a shit about is the fetus while its in utero. Once it gets its first cry suddenly in your eyes its just another poverty stricken criminal-in-waiting whelpling born of a morally questionable whore and an anonymous baby-daddy that’s stealing money from welfare, not giving back to society and dragging the rest of us down.\n\n        Your narrow minded morality tale doesn’t impress me — you’re only true interest is forcing all of us to live by your mores by any means. Religious fascists by any other name.\n\n        How many children have you adopted?","collection":"posts","url":"/how-dare-you-judge/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2007-08-22-upgrading-woes.md","collection":"posts","url":"/upgrading-woes/","path":"_posts/2007-08-22-upgrading-woes.md","id":"/upgrading-woes","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Upgrading Woes","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2007-08-22 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"upgrading-woes","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2007-08-13-how-dare-you-judge.md","excerpt":"<p>So near where I work there is a Planned Parenthood facility.

(  Aaawwww.. But maaaa!!!  )\n\nI'll be a good little boy and wait though.. *taps foot*\n\n####Space Submarine!\n\nWhile playing any game, I just about always think about how to improve the game, or how the game could be thought about in different ways..  Not only am I looking for emergent game play ideas, but how the game play in general can be applied to other genre of games -- as well as how the game itself could be improved.\nIt occurred to me while playing Silent Hunter 3 that this same game could be applied to space combat..  Most likely in the \"far distant future\" you're going to be attacking space ships in the very same manner that submarines have been doing it since the 30's.  Sneak up.. Launch weapon.. Run away and hope you don't die.. hehe\n\nMost weapons in the future will have a range far beyond what we have today, and even today our weapons reach far beyond what we can see or perceive physically..    So why do all space games out there use very short ranged laser weaponry that must be manually aimed?  Why do we look through windows at the vast black searching with our eyes for our enemy to shoot?  It's silly..\n\nDon't even get me started on the \"short ranged laser\"...  But why wouldn't we be fighting more from a position of stealth in which our ship does the majority of the work?  You start hidden waiting for target or trolling for a target from a position of stealth.. Once it shows up, you select the target through whatever targeting devices we use then push the \"launch\" button and go back to ground.  The concept of a first person space shooter isn't a good one just due to the size of space in general as well as the relative speed and size of objects in it.  Two \"fighter craft\" in space might never see one another, never mind actually mingling and fighting one another.\n\nAnyone who knows me and my game dreams knows this is a radical step away from my previous position.. I used to think it was a good idea to continue the first person space game genre, but maybe thats why they haven't done well..  It doesn't make sense - and unlike fantasy games in which things don't have to make any kind of sense (P1:\"Uh hows this work?!\"  P2:\"Magic\"  P1:\"Oh okay..\") most scientific/futuristic games will need to be based on some kind of reality or its just \"fantasy in the future.\"\n\nThe more I think about it, the more I think that small fighter craft in a space situation will be of very limited use.  I think you're going to see a lot more hot battleship on battleship action.  Or if I were to make a game this is how it would be..\n\n####Silent Hunter 3\n\nSomething I think SH3 needs is the ability for players to play the destroyers.. I love playing a sub and sinking ships, but it would be equally cool to play the sub hunter..  Or even play multiplayer, sub versus sub or sub versus destroyer..\n\nIt does have a multiplayer aspect, but I have no idea how it works.\n","collection":"posts","url":"/space-submarine/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2007-10-30-space-submarine.md","collection":"posts","url":"/space-submarine/","path":"_posts/2007-10-30-space-submarine.md","id":"/space-submarine","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Space Submarine!","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2007-10-30 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"space-submarine","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2007-11-05-games-should-be-fun.md","content":"So I have been playing <a href=\"http://www.eve-online.com\" target=\"_blank\">Eve Online</a> again a bit and have been thinking about it and what it does \"wrong\".  I'm trying to focus on what should have been done so that new games like <a href=\"http://www.fl-tw.com/Infinity/\" target=\"_blank\">Infinity Earth</a> don't fall into the same trap.  I just hope the new games will listen and take note.\n\nFirst let me start by saying that I think Eve Online is a beautiful game and can be fun once you get DEEP into the game, and it's certainly challenging. However a new players experience is terrible and doesn't give any clues as to what is to come later, more over the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_versus_environment\" target=\"_blank\">PVE</a> aspect of the game is down right bad which means new players are forced to deal with experienced players in a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_versus_player\" target=\"_blank\">PVP</a> realm often resulting in repeated trouncings with no end in sight.\n\nIs it any wonder that many new players leave pretty quick?  Think of what kind of power house this game would be if it's new player experience was just a bit better..\n\nThe biggest problem with Eve online is it's learning curve, it's steep to the point of making Mt. Everest look small. Combine the learning curve with the complete lack of \"newbie\" game and the fact that it's PVE content is nearly non-existent and you have the core issues.\n\nA new player to Eve is immediately overwhelmed with the UI and all the possible features and functions in the game.  <a href=\"http://www.ccpgames.com/\" target=\"_blank\">CCP</a> has done a pretty good job creating a tutorial for the new players to follow, but even so once the tutorial is over you're very much thrown to the wolves.  And trust me when I say, the players in Eve aren't forgiving or kind in their treatment of others.  If you cross the wrong line you'll find yourself on the wrong end of some pretty big guns..\n\nAs I said above, the PVE aspect of Eve is nearly non-existent and this is a damn shame.  They could have done so much with this.  Look at the major (read: successful/profitable) MMO games out there and see that all of them have vast loads of PVE content.  Some of that very simple content could benefit the game as a whole greatly. I think Eve and CCP could do a lot of justice to the game by taking a realistic look at what the other MMO games are doing and maybe implementing some of it.  I'm not suggesting changing any of the end game PVP stuff.. (So calm down guys..)\n\nOur goal as gamers is to have fun, their goal as a game producer is to make money.  Chasing away players due to complexity and other issues is bad and ultimately doesn't meet either goal, thus implementing some of the stuff that makes WoW or EQ2 popular might help the game.\n\nNow I just crossed a line.  I am sure the rabid pack of Eve players that do actually read this are now frothing at the mouth because of what I just suggested..  It seems at every turn the hard core gamers out there bash games like WoW and EQ2 for being too easy or being too \"care bear.\"  Its very easy for these extremists to badmouth WoW without looking at all the things they are doing right.  Personally I don't care for WoW either, but I atleast can recognize some of the things that the game has done right and what other games can take from it.\n\nGiving the players something easy to do will help the people become in tune with their character.   It will help them build a sense of ownership and pride in there online persona, as well as foster a desire to achieve greater and greater goals.  In other words, it makes them want to keep playing the game.\n\nRealistically, in Eve the PVE content should give the players something to do while waiting for their skills to train up.  There only other option really is to mine rocks in high security space, which is tough with all the farmers -- Not to mention down right boring.\n\nThe real \"fun\" of Eve doesn't come until Much MUCH later in the game.  And new players don't get to experience any of that for months.  But just like a new player to EQ2 doesn't get to raid gods their first day, neither should Eve players.  The difference is EQ2 players CAN raid smaller boss mobs, or at least get some idea of what a raid would be like at lower levels.  Eve players have no clue what its like to play with the big boys until its too late and they are \"egging\" their way back to a home base.  Trust me, this isn't fun -- it's frustrating as hell.\n\nYou don't want to piss off your players -- it hurts your bottom line.\n\nI fear that so many new games that are being created by small developers, like Infinity Earth, are so against creating what they call a \"WoW clone\" that they aren't willing to even look at some of the stuff that WoW did right.\n\nI'm all for thinking outside the box, and implementing things others haven't tried, but to dismiss everything that WoW did simply because \"its been done\" or because they don't want to be identified with something that the big boys did, is folly.\n\nGames should be fun. More over to be successful they should be fun for the majority, not just a niche market.  An example was <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega_%281989_computer_game%29\" target=\"_blank\">Omega</a>.  Omega was a programmers game in that to truly play it and know how to play it, you had to know how to program.  Talk about niche!  I thought it was HUGELY fun, and thought it would take off like a rocket.  Of course it didn't do that well because most people didn't know how to write the code required to program the tanks..  Sure it was fun to me, but not to the majority -- the majority rule, don't lose sight of that.\n\nPeople want to play games because they are fun..  I think its the responsibility of developers to give them fun games to play.  And in Eve's case it would be easy!  You could add low level content, without altering the rest of the game at all.\n\nI wonder why they wont..\n","collection":"posts","url":"/games-should-be-fun/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2008-01-07-eve-being-bad-and-tools.md","collection":"posts","url":"/eve-being-bad-and-tools/","path":"_posts/2008-01-07-eve-being-bad-and-tools.md","id":"/eve-being-bad-and-tools","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Eve being bad and tools","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-01-07 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"eve-being-bad-and-tools","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2007-11-05-games-should-be-fun.md","excerpt":"I fear that so many new games that are being created by small developers, like Infinity Earth, are so against creating what they call a \"WoW clone\" that they aren't willing to even look at some of the stuff that WoW did right.","id":"/games-should-be-fun","draft":false,"categories":["Games","Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Games should be fun","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2007-11-05 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"games-should-be-fun","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2007-10-30-space-submarine.md","excerpt":"I have been playing the hell out of Silent Hunter 3 recently.  I have always enjoyed good submarine games, which can be tough to do in an age of few good submarine games heh..    The Silent Hunter games are excellent however, and I very much look forward to getting Silent Hunter 4 -- which is out already, but I've been forbidden to purchase since Christmas is coming up..","id":"/space-submarine","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Space Submarine!","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2007-10-30 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"space-submarine","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2007-10-11-gutsy-windows-and-portal.md","excerpt":"At work I use just about nothing but Linux.  Even my IBM issued laptop is dual-bootable..
