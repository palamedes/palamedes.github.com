And I have to say, <a href=\"/rock-band-to-real-band/\">I totally called it</a>!!   Or at the very least I wished for it really, really hard over a year ago..  I know they have been working to get to this point for years, but I want to take credit!  haha\n\nFirstly --  Watch this video that Engadget posted today:\n<object id=\"viddler\" classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" width=\"437\" height=\"266\" codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowScriptAccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"flashvars\" value=\"fake=1\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"http://www.viddler.com/simple/b0821d16/\" /><param name=\"name\" value=\"viddler\" /><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" /><embed id=\"viddler\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"437\" height=\"266\" src=\"http://www.viddler.com/simple/b0821d16/\" name=\"viddler\" flashvars=\"fake=1\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\"></embed></object>\n(<a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2010/09/14/rock-band-3-pro-guitar-preview-the-guitarist-vs-the-guitar-her/\" target=\"_blank\">Link to full story</a>)\n\nI am SO very proud of Harmonix..  They have the vision to follow this thing through to the final conclusion.. You guys ROCK!   Even if the end product is only so so, it still will go a really long way towards a musical reawakening..  I can't wait!!\n\nThis \"game\" will be the next hot ticket you watch.. I put game in quotes because this sucker is transcending game, and becoming something much more..  I really believe everyone will buy this thing, and it will sell like crazy cause suddenly not only will video game enthusiasts buy it for the pure fun of it, but would-be musicians and music teachers alike will use it as a training tool!!!  Awesome sauce.. They just doubled their potential user base..  Probably more really..\n\nMy only concern at this point is screen real estate..  Now they have Vocals, Guitar, Bass, Drums and Keyboard...  Going to be darn hard to fit much more in there unless they start having guitar and bass share a single track or something.. (totally doable..)\n\nI also seriously hope they have a pro-piano mode like the pro-guitar mode promised..   I have a full sized Yamaha keyboard (<a href=\"/play-the-radio/\">that I have talked about before</a>) with midi that is just beginning me to play it..  Either way I'll get to learn to play a guitar one way or the other and have fun doing it..  Just awesome..\n\nI'm so stoked.. I can't wait to get my hands on this and begin learning..  Thanks Harmonix.\n","collection":"posts","url":"/rockband-3/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2010-09-15-i-hate-people.md","collection":"posts","url":"/i-hate-people/","path":"_posts/2010-09-15-i-hate-people.md","id":"/i-hate-people","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"I hate people...","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2010/09/internet_dickwad_theory.gif","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2010-09-15 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"i-hate-people","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2010-09-14-rockband-3.md","excerpt":"I can't even begin to describe how awesome this is going to be..  I'm so stoked..

I mean flame one another and act complete assholes..    Oh goodie..\n\nSeriously whats the point of a chat system when people only use it to call one another \"noob\" or worse..  It's not used for actual game play, which is what it was clearly design for.. or even friendly chat..  But rather used to cast the most obnoxious slander and profane slurs at other people just to get a rise out of folks..\n\nMost of these children haven't had their nap yet for the day so they frustrated at the game and feel the need to lash out at their own team..\n\nToday I had one guy go off on me about how I was a noob and the worst player he had ever seen when I was ganked by 3 other players..  *shrug* I died.. it happens.. 3 people jumped me.. 3v1 is hard to pull off in LoL.. No big deal..    The same 3 people did it to him, and he was \"unlucky\"..  Oh I see.. so when I die it's cause I'm a noob.. when you die to the exact samething, you're just unlucky.. What a jackass..\n\nThis sort of behavior happens every game..  More over, I see people all the time actually demand that other players do what they say.. never mind how you want to have fun.. no you do what I say!!   Seriously?   How about you play your game, and I'll play mine..  Where do you get off demanding I play a certain way?  Who the hell do you think you are?\n\nThe question I have to the gamers out there that feel the need to show your ass is;  why do this?!  Why do you feel the need to bash and badmouth everyone?  Is your life so pathetic that you must put everyone else down in order to feel good about yourself?   Why do you think you're better than everyone else?  Why do you think you're opinion carries more weight or that you know better about everything than everyone else?\n\nIt really frustrates me because I was raised to be a good person and not treat other people like garbage..  I also believe you shouldn't say anything over the internet that you wouldn't say in person..   And lets be honest, the vast majority of these kids wont dare say this shit to someone in person because they know they'd be eating fist shortly there after..  That makes them a coward too..\n\nSo, now you're not only an asshat but a craven one at that..  Why can't you leave people alone?   Don't be like this.. it just makes you look bad..\n\nThe real sad statement is that a lot of kids these days use this obnoxious and profane behavior as \"good-natured banter\" when it's anything but..  Being intentionally harsh and rude to someone is never a good idea unless you have known that person long enough to know its okay and they know you're kidding.. It's certainly never okay to a complete stranger..\n\nBut then that's the issue.. Anonymity on the internet means everyone's a stranger.. More over, it means you're 100% anonymous and can say or do anything you want \"without repercussion\"..  The fact that most people choose to be a jerk as opposed to nice is a sign of our times, and a bad one..  I tend to think of it as the harbinger of our societies downfall that people go \"asshole\" before they go \"nice\"..\n\nMy father always told me that a true test of character is what you do when no one can stop you..  I have to think that kids that act this way fail this test completely..\n\nActing obnoxiously on the internet is not only rude, but it's a cowardly act and you're pathetic if you behave that way..   More over, you don't know everything and certainly don't have the whole picture, why not just do your thing and let other people do their thing..\n\nOr even better, try something new for once..  Be nice..\n","collection":"posts","url":"/i-hate-people/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2010-09-15-i-hate-people.md","collection":"posts","url":"/i-hate-people/","path":"_posts/2010-09-15-i-hate-people.md","id":"/i-hate-people","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"I hate people...","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2010/09/internet_dickwad_theory.gif","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2010-09-15 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"i-hate-people","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2010-09-26-book-review-a-game-of-thrones.md","content":"<img class=\"pull-right\" title=\"30652075\" src=\"/images/2010/09/30652075.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"170\" height=\"280\" />I don't normally do book reviews but this book was so good I had to make an exception..   This book is easily some of the best candy I have had in a long time, with extremely rich and deep characters that often leave you guessing as to whom the good guy or bad guy actually is.. \n\nSet in a fictional medieval time this book is a fantasy, but the fantastic elements slowly creep in over the course of the series and as such almost seems more of a historical fiction with knights, kings and what not..   Either way, George R.R.

It was quite possibly one of the best 3 hour games I have ever played.. I mean, it was absolutely genius..  It a first person physics puzzle that walked this amazingly fine line of comedic darkness that kept you thinking, and laughing..\n\nThe only negative feedback anyone ever was able to come up with was how short it was.. When I say its a 3 hour game.. I mean it, it's a 3 hour game..  Even going slow you should be able to solve it in that amount of time..  You can eek out a couple extra hours of fun by doing the bonus levels or trying to get all the achievements but that's really it..\n\nThat was a tad disappointing, but Valve knew they were on to something and started working on the next installment almost immediately..\n\nAnd I have to say, holy crap.. it looks amazing..  Check out all the videos over at <a href=\"http://thinkwithportals.com/\" target=\"_blank\">http://thinkwithportals.com/</a>\n\nI couldn't help but sit here giggling with the pure liquid awesomeness that is the coming game.. It looks so good!   I got so excited I played through the first game again..\n\nAnd btw, if you haven't played Portal yet.. You should.. It costs $19 on Steam and is worth every penny!  yes it's only a 3 hour game, but still it's so fun you'll likely play it several times.. I know I have...\n","collection":"posts","url":"/portal-2-looks-so-awesome/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2010-10-11-portal-2-looks-so-awesome.md","collection":"posts","url":"/portal-2-looks-so-awesome/","path":"_posts/2010-10-11-portal-2-looks-so-awesome.md","id":"/portal-2-looks-so-awesome","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Portal

fancybox\"><img title=\"Voting Process\" src=\"/images/2010/11/votingprocess-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Voting Process\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Voting Process</span></a>\n\nSo as a general rule, I don't vote.  I don't vote, and it's my right to do so.  Leave me alone.  Stop harassing me with mindless slogans and social pressure.  I don't want to be bothered by it, I don't have to be bothered by it, I won't be bothered by it.\n\nThe common sense rhetoric that often follows my making that statement is that if I don't vote, then I shouldn't complain or that \"bad officials are sent to govern where good people don't vote\".. etc..\n\nI disagree.  I maintain that voting in ignorance of the issues or the people and their policies is worse that voting at all..\n\nI don't vote because I know myself to not be educated as to the various parties, stances, issues..etc.  And that you by voting, have in fact gone out of your way to educate yourself, as opposed to voting from a stance of ignorance..  So if you vote badly, then I can complain about your poor choice.. =)  I say this facetiously but there's a hint of truth to it..\n\nEither way I am very tired of the often attempted guilt inducing slogans and verbiage that voters feel is their right to spout at those who choose to abstain..  The very notion that those who refrain from voting are often the ones to blame, or that some how by not acting as an agent for one party or another makes you an agent for the other side is pure shenanigans..\n\nSome might wonder why I don't go out of my way to educate myself as to the issues and the people so that I can offset the ignorant..etc..  I don't vote for a number of reasons but the primary one is because I'm completely disillusioned with the system and because I am tired of trying to sift through the reams and volumes of lies and bullshit to get to the nugget of truth that an individual should use to cast their ballot..\n\nI really believe the system is broken.  It's not because I'm lazy or that I simply don't care.  If I didn't care, I wouldn't be writing this.  I just don't like how things are working right now and am voicing my right to not \"pick the lesser of two evils\" and I don't feel in the least bit guilty about this..  I have made a choice to not make a choice, and that's okay.\n\nSee the whole voting process is based on the notion that we are all equal and that we all get to turn in one ballot, and those votes should all be treated equally with no exception because we are all educated on the issues and policies.  Sounds great!  But its completely unrealistic.  Gone are the days were it was even possible to know all the candidates, or the issues.  It's simply not possible.\n\nThis very system means that someone who is so stupid as to not know the Earth revolves around the Sun, or that evolution actually happened has the power to negate your carefully considered opinion just because some bumper sticker or social pressure guilted him into going out and voting.\n\nSo with one swift stroke, or a flip of a switch this uneducated person (who has no idea what or who they are voting for) has the power to enact through their vote legislation that will now affect you.\n\nI agree that individuals should have the right to vote, and that they should do so with an educated view of the outcome, but the masses are so far from being \"in the know\" that it breaks the system down, and that's exactly where the government wants you.   The government wants you to believe that by choosing one or the other bad candidate you're in charge and making a difference!  Crock of shit.\n\nPolitics any more is about who can out lie the other, who can put on the best face and look good on TV.  How many TV ads start with one political jack monkey bashing another one in order to prove he's the best.  That's broken.  If the only way one candidate can differentiate himself from another is to bash and badmouth, then he has nothing worth having and he's already lost.  What happens though when they all do it?  Who do you vote for when they all suck?\n\nMore over,  I really believe one vote doesn't matter, doesn't make a difference..  If Candidate A had 23.012345% of the vote before I voted, and 23.012346% of the vote after I voted it makes no difference.  No news outlet reports that many decimal points.. The simply truth is that one vote has no value and I can prove it to you;\n\nIf my vote is such a big deal I'll tell ya what, I'll sell you my vote.   I'm pretty sure I can get a mail ballot and send it to you so that you can vote as me..  You can vote for anything you want..  That's pretty cool right?  Suddenly you could double your voting potential!\n\nHow much is my vote worth to you?  How much money are you willing to send to me in order to get this \"precious commodity\"?   yeah I thought so..\n\nUltimately though, it's my right.  I served in the US Army and after words as a Police Officer to ensure your freedoms and mine.  I choose, to not choose.\n","collection":"posts","url":"/i-dont-vote/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2010-11-05-game-review-star-wars-the-force-unleashed-2.md","collection":"posts","url":"/game-review-star-wars-the-force-unleashed-2/","path":"_posts/2010-11-05-game-review-star-wars-the-force-unleashed-2.md","id":"/game-review-star-wars-the-force-unleashed-2","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Game Review: Star Wars The Force Unleashed 2","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2010/11/tfu2_dated.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2010-11-05 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"game-review-star-wars-the-force-unleashed-2","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2010-11-02-i-dont-vote.md","excerpt":"So as a general rule, I don't vote.  I don't vote, and it's my right to do so.  Leave me alone.  Stop harassing me with mindless slogans and social pressure.
