src=\"/images/2010/06/citibank_logo.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"320\" height=\"214\" />\n\nI have been a Citibank member for 15 years.  I got my first Citicard in 1995 while I was in the military after I got back from Korea because I figured it was time to go ahead and start working on my credit..\n\nI have always tried to keep a balance off of it, but there have been a couple  years where just due to the times I couldn't help but carry a small balance..\n\nWell the other day I went to pay off my card and I noticed that they bumped my APR to 29.998%...   Are you fucking kidding me?  30% APR is highway robbery..\n\nI called them up and asked them to lower my rate and they refused..  The operator I got ahold of (once I navigated their automated system) told me that \".. they were unable to lower my rate at this time. Thanks for calling.. *click*\"\n\nI immediately called them back and told the new operator (that I got after navigating their automated system.. again) that I wanted to cancel my account and that it was due to their recent rate hike.. I have zero intention of paying 30% and that's ludicrous..   He said, \"but wait.. what if we lowered your APR would that make you stay?\"\n\nI explained that the previous operator told me there was no way to lower my rate.. So I want to cancel the account.. (2)..  He came back explaining that he could lower my rate to 26% for 6 months.. (after which it would spring back to 30%)..  I said that this was a bunch of crap, that if this was such a deal why didn't the last guy offer it and that 26% is still robbery..  No thank you, I'd like to cancel my account.. (3)..\n\n\"But wouldn't you like to lower your rate?\" ..   I explained that if he could lower my rate to 0% I'd stick around, otherwise, I'd like to cancel my account.. (4)..  \"No you want to lower your rate, so that the remaining balance doesn't take that 30% rate, but instead gets this much lower rate... \"  (26% is \"much lower\")..  I told him that I just paid the account off, online.. that there is no remaining balance and that I'd like to cancel my account.. (5)..\n\nBut.. blah blah.. and blahdiddy blah..   I'd like to cancel my account.. (6).. if you keep pestering me to lower my rate I will ask to speak to your manager..\n\n\"Id be more than happy to let you speak to my manager..  but golly we need to lower this rate.. blah blah bullshit bullshit I'm a douche blah blah blah\"..   I'd like to cancel my fucking account please.. (7).. and now I want to speak to your manager..\n\nI honestly was getting really pissed.. this asshat wouldn't let me just cancel the damn account..  I don't want it any more.. you're trying to screw me, and I refuse to do business with you..  Take your \"amazing low rate of 26%\" and shove it up your ass..  cancel my account.. I shouldn't have to ask for this 7+ times.. (I'm sure it was more than 7.. this is very much the short version.. )\n\nEventually he asks me to hold (I fully expected him to just hang up the phone..)  A minute or so later someone got on the line claiming to be his manager and I told him that I wanted to cancel the account and that I shouldn't have to ask so many times, and that I shouldn't be pressured to do something I don't want to do.. I want to cancel the account.. Period.. I'm done working with you..\n\nHe said, \"Fine it's canceled, do you want confirmation of the cancelation?\"  -- \"You're damn skippy.. \"  --  \"It will be sent to your billing address.. *click*\"\n\nThe manager was rude as hell..  I should never have had to deal with him.. The initial call taker should be fired to be honest.. Or retrained at best..\n\nAs to Citibank..  I'm done with you..  Jack my rate to 30% which should be criminal, and then as of April 1st 2010, charge a $60 annual fee just to have the card?!   That's $60 a year, just to have that card empty in your wallet.  Are you kidding me?  This is some kind of joke right?\n\nIt's clear to me that Citibank doesn't give a rats ass about their members if this is the way they plan to treat us..   So fine.. Bye.. I'm done with Citibank forever.. I wont do business with you ever again.. period.\n\nMore over I plan to tell as many people as possible not to do business with Citibank as they are clearly a bunch of crooks..\n","previous":{"next":{"path":"_posts/2010-06-29-fuck-you-citibank.md","url":"/fuck-you-citibank/","relative_path":"_posts/2010-06-29-fuck-you-citibank.md","id":"/fuck-you-citibank","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"15yr Citibank member says; Fuck you Citibank","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2010/06/citibank_logo.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2010-06-29 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"fuck-you-citibank","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2010-05-13-game-review-napoleon-total-war.md","output":null,"content":"<img title=\"Napoleon Total War\" src=\"/images/2010/05/napoleon-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Napoleon Total War\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" class='pull-right' />\n\nI have always been a fan of the Total War franchise, but in my opinion none of them have been all that great.  Good and fun in most cases, sure.. but great?  Eh not really..  All of them have had their share of issues of which Napoleon TW shares some of them.. NTW is by far the most refined version so far and a lot of fun but, I'm not quite sure it peeks the \"great\" meter just yet.. I will say its pretty darn good and a lot of fun though..\n\nTotally worth the price as it's clear to me that Creative Assembly (the developers) are getting better at their craft but the game has one staggering short fall that it shares with all it's siblings;  Horrible AI.\n\nThis is the 6th iteration of the game core concept and the AI is still just dreadful..  I'm pretty sure we could train a monkey to play the game better..  I know AI is very complex and as a programmer myself I'm not sure how to solve this problem, but dang..  The computer is down right bad.   Given enough time you probably could beat any army with just about any force..  It's actually fun trying to do just that.. heh\n\nIn comparison to Empire Total War, it's immediate predecessor, Napoleon is the clear winner.  The game is much more polished and refined than ETW ever was and it makes me feel like ETW was what NTW was supposed to be, but they ran out of time and money..  I will say that the AI in NTW is better than ETW, but when up is the only possible direction....\n\nI will say this, NTW is beautiful.. There is nothing cooler than watching your line of infantry slowly disappear in a hazy cloud of black powder smoke as a line of enemy advance forward.. Or the small skip gashes that are cut into the scenery as a cannon ball goes whizzing by.. Great stuff..  The level of care and detail there is pretty high..\n\nBut the AI is so dumb that the enemy unit of 120 line infantry will happily walk into a line of cannon..  Or horse melee units that charge into the barriers (only to die immediately in droves)..  Or how the diplomacy system is completely pointless..etc..\n\nThe AI is the killer.. It's just not good..\n\nOne way they got around that was to introduce the notion of \"drop in battles\" in which you can, during your single player campaign, enlist a friend (or complete stranger even) to play the part of the enemy during some of the battles.   I will admit.. This was a damn good and innovative idea.. Well done guys..  I love this..\n\nWhats nice about it is that the other player when he's playing your enemy, or when you're playing his enemy in his campaign, isn't really invested in the same way..  So if he loses it's almost like it's not a personal loss.. after all its not like you chose the force..etc..   I like it.. this was a good addition to the game..\n\nFor the next iteration of the game I hope they go more into the trading, and economy aspects of the game.   I want to be able to set individual tax rates for a single province.. or define whats being traded where..etc..  Right now its fairly limited.. you're either trading or not.. etc..  I know this game is more about the killin and less about things like trade and diplomacy but I still would like a more rounded game experience in these areas..\n\nAll in all... Not \"great\".. but pretty damn good and a lot of fun against like minded friends..\n\nAdditional;\n\nI really think Games Workshop should get with Creative Assembly and make Warhammer Total War.. Dear god.. talk about two franchises that absolutely belong together..  This engine, plus GW's IP?!  WIN!!  It would be like chocolate and peanut butter man..\n\nHow cool would it be to see a pack of Skaven march into a pack of Witchelves (dead Skaven)..  Or see a bunch of Jezzails take out some Coldone Knights.. etc..  Hot..\n\nI think this is such a good idea I'm going to send them a letter...\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2010-05-01-game-review-splintercell-conviction.md","url":"/game-review-splintercell-conviction/","relative_path":"_posts/2010-05-01-game-review-splintercell-conviction.md","id":"/game-review-splintercell-conviction","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Game Review: Splintercell Conviction","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2010/05/tom_clancys_splinter_cell_conviction-4.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":true,"allow_comments":false,"date":"2010-05-01 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"game-review-splintercell-conviction","ext":".md"},"url":"/game-review-napoleon-total-war/","relative_path":"_posts/2010-05-13-game-review-napoleon-total-war.md","id":"/game-review-napoleon-total-war","collection":"posts","excerpt":"I have always been a fan of the Total War franchise, but in my opinion none of them have been all that great.  Good and fun in most cases, sure..","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Game Review: Napoleon Total War","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2010/05/napoleon-150x150.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":true,"allow_comments":false,"date":"2010-05-13 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"game-review-napoleon-total-war","ext":".md"},"url":"/fuck-you-citibank/","relative_path":"_posts/2010-06-29-fuck-you-citibank.md","id":"/fuck-you-citibank","collection":"posts","excerpt":"Well the other day I went to pay off my card and I noticed that they bumped my APR to 29.998%...   Are you fucking kidding me?  30% APR is highway robbery..
