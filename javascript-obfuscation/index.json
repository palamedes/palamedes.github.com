When I was in middle and high school I was in band and played everything from the trombone to the baritone and tuba but my musical aspirations sorta died there.   So it's not that I don't have skill, or that I can't learn -- I just haven't.   I know many folks that are completely tone deaf, I'm not one of those.  I just haven't had the time/inclination to invest into learning a musical instrument.\n\nMy lack of musical skills came gallingly apparent one year at Halloween when everyone in the company showed up playing some instrument or another -- and I had nothing of the sort.  One of the co-workers asked with complete honesty and earnest, \"What instrument do you play?\" as if it were a foregone conclusion that I had to play something..\n\nMy response was, \"I can play the radio..\"  Which got a chuckle from everyone who heard it, but it left me a little hollow inside.  I really do want to learn something I just am not sure what.  Or rather, I wasn't.\n\nFirstly, why did the aspirations die?   Well band in middle school was something we did to get the required credit and to avoid any sort of P.E. ~ I'm lazy and playing an instrument sounded a lot more fun that running laps around a track.  And while it filled that need nicely, it really did nothing to foster musical desires or competency on my part and I largely didn't enjoy it..\n\nI think the primary reason for my lack of enthusiasm was that I wanted to play the saxophone, but was assigned the trombone.  Back then the players had virtually NO choice..  Had I showed up with a sax of my own and could form the correct embouchure I'm sure I would have been a shoe in, but since we didn't own a sax and I had no clue what an <a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/embouchure\" target=\"_blank\">embouchure</a> was;  I wasn't even remotely in the running for the job.  I was handed a trombone and told to go sit down -- I made do.  But I didn't like it.\n\nI enjoyed the baritone more, but didn't get to play it for long before they decided they needed me carrying the sousaphone around.  That effectively ended my band career in my mind.   I quit the band and spent the next 4 years swimming on the swim team.. Hey at least I wasn't running laps ~ just swimming them.  Low impact I tell ya! (trying to put a positive spin on it)\n\nSo whats changed?  Well.. Nothing.  I still don't play anything and really would like to.  It's something that I want to get into as a hobby.  Just something I can piddle around with.\n\nPart of the issue is my other major hobby is software engineering -- programming.  I very much enjoy programming and it's something I do often, but it's also what I do for a living.  And nothing will rob you of a hobby more than being forced to do it.\n\nSo I need a new hobby.  My usual waste of time comes in the form of playing games, but that's still massive amounts of time with 'ass in chair' really not expanding my horizons.. Playing games is fine and all but it doesn't broaden the mind much.  Entertaining, sure.. Growth educing, not so much..\n\nSo this has made me want to look at musical instruments again.  I have always had a fondness for music and really would like to learn to make my own.  When I listen to music I often imagine myself playing the instruments and what that must feel like..\n\n<img class=\"pull-right\" title=\"Yamaha s90\" src=\"/images/2008/07/s90.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" />I thought for a long time that I'd like to learn to play the piano, and even got one.  I have a very nice <a href=\"http://www.yamaha.com/yamahavgn/CDA/ContentDetail/ModelSeriesDetail/0,,CNTID%25253D2709%252526CTID%25253D206500%252526CNTYP%25253DPRODUCT,00.html\" target=\"_blank\">Yamaha S90</a> piano that I really have never learned to use.\n\nIt's an excellent piano with all manner of very nice bells and whistles, but for what ever reason it didn't inspire me like I thought it would.\n\nI tried, and had a friend start to teach me but it just didn't do anything for me.  It was a bit daunting of course because of all the various buttons, dials and widgets but so long as you just focused on the piano keys themselves it was fine.  It played nicely as far as I could tell but I really didn't get much out of it.   I certainly didn't do it any justice and at this point its a shame the machine isn't being better used.  I don't feel it was too hard for me, it just didn't inspire me.\n\nI still very much like the idea of learning to play the piano but it still doesn't grip me like I thought it would.  I think each person to their instrument and this one simply isn't mine.\n\nFor a long time I wanted to learn to play the guitar and that still entertains me to some degree but no more so than the piano.  I know several folks who play the guitar and even dated a woman many years ago who was into it..  Classical acoustic guitar sounded very warm and soulful and I think would be a lot of fun to play.  I may still get one at some point, but it doesn't really drag me away from my other hobbies right now.\n\nI was digging around on the internet when I stumbled across the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapman_Stick\" target=\"_blank\">Chapman Stick</a> being played by <a href=\"http://myspace.com/robmartino\" target=\"_blank\">Rob Martino</a> in his song <a href=\"http://youtube.com/watch?v=_JjimMO2SdE\" target=\"_blank\">\"One Cloud\" on You Tube</a>..  Nice job Rob.  Well done my friend.\n\nThis instrument has been around since the mid 70's but is completely new to me.  I never new it existed until recently (a couple months ago now).  When I saw Rob playing it though I immediately recognized it as a \"Baliset\" which I thought was a completely fictional instrument played by Gurney Halleck (Patrick Stuart) in David Lynch's move Dune.\n\nThis was a favorite movie of mine when I was a younger man and so I had seen the Baliset scene many times. So, I was stunned to find that the Baliset was a real instrument, sorta.\n\nI've been looking into this for a couple months now and the chapman stick really kind of speaks to me.  One thing I like about it is that, from everything I have read it is the perfect amalgamation of keyboard and guitar -- in one.\n\nI am going to keep looking into it, but I think I'd like to learn to play one.   So far from what I have seen they are brutally expensive.. but I have a nice keyboard I can sell in order to get one, or atleast part way to one.\n\nI have read a couple folks say that learning the guitar first is good, while others say because of the \"free hands\" tap method used to play it learning the guitar first is actually a hindrance..   I don't know of course.. and comments are welcome..\n\nI'm going to keep looking into it though.. I have nothing but time so this is no rush.. but I think I'd like to learn the stick.  Getting setup with one might be the hard part.. but eventually..\n\nIf not the stick then something else.. I know that most of this is likely a pipedream, but I want to learn something.. I need to unplug a tad from all my gaming and programming ~ this seems a good direction..\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2008-06-30-web-based-games.md","url":"/web-based-games/","relative_path":"_posts/2008-06-30-web-based-games.md","id":"/web-based-games","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Games","Software Development"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Web based games","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-06-30 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"web-based-games","ext":".md"},"url":"/play-the-radio/","relative_path":"_posts/2008-07-07-play-the-radio.md","id":"/play-the-radio","collection":"posts","excerpt":"... and that's about it.

And just about all of them has brought to the fore of my mind the glaring fact that there is nothing they have done that I can't do.   Seriously.  More over, I think I can do it better in just about every way.\n\nOne of the games I find myself playing is a space game which, to be fair, isn't very good -- in fact it's bad.  It's just not a very good game, yet for some reason I find myself continuing to play it -- as does a lot of other folks.  It's strangely popular.   While playing at just about every turn I see things that could not only be done a little better, but done WAY better.   Not just game play wise, but technically as well.  Their HTML is bad, they clearly don't understand CSS and their PHP is poorly written (from what I can tell.)  So, this of course always lead me to the line of thinking that, why shouldn't I try to make my own?\n\nI have a lot of irons in the fire right now so it would happen after I get the WPMU thing up and working, but if they can make a popular game, and it's in that condition -- anything I make should be at least as popular.\n\nI want to make a game, everyone knows that.  I want to make a space game, most know that too.   I already have some ideas as to the game itself, but the majority of the time my idea was to make a game in C/C++/Java or some other language than the one that I'm familiar with.\n\nI think this outlines a colossal error in my thinking..  I'm a professional developer of web applications.. I consider myself to be an expert in php, javascript, xhtml, css, etc..   I should use those, since its what I know.   It's only a minor rewrite of my core ideas to make them come inline with a web based game.\n\nThe hard part will be figuring out the specifics..  I mean web based games by their very nature are turn based games so this is the paradigm you're stuck with.. if I can adopt my ideas to a turn based game then we are good to go!\n\nI'd love to see a Masters of Orion like game made into a web based game, but how would that work?  That game has a definite start and end to it and it seems to me that most games that work that would would tend towards alienating your players every time the game \"ends\" and restarts..\n\nI almost lean towards a persistent world where by the game doesn't end, it just continues on.\n\nI'll have to ponder this.. I'm pretty keen on it.\n","previous":{"next":{"path":"_posts/2008-06-30-web-based-games.md","url":"/web-based-games/","relative_path":"_posts/2008-06-30-web-based-games.md","id":"/web-based-games","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Games","Software Development"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Web based games","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-06-30 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"web-based-games","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2008-06-25-javascript-obfuscation.md","output":null,"content":"Code obfuscators will strip out the unnecessary characters like white space, tabs, newlines and comments.

I pondered it a bit and it occurred to me that this was a very misleading question, and showed an error in thinking.  Of the three commonly used formats none of them are \"correct\" and all three of them have their place in web design.  This is very much a \"use the correct format, for the correct job.\"\n\nOf the three image types commonly used on the web today (GIF, PNG and JPEG) usually the argument comes in the form of people agreeing that JPEG has one use; and either GIF or PNG has the other use. The religious war begins when folks try to argue the merits of GIF versus PNG.  And usually it comes in the form of arguing PNG's new hotness and it's lack of support by Microsoft against GIF as the old standard that may not have as many features but at least its supported.\n\nLets examine each format;\n\n__Graphics Interchange Format__, or GIF is an 8 bit format that was introduced by CompuServe back in the late 80's. It's one of the first 2 image formats used on the world wide web and continues to be one of the big three formats used through out the web.  GIF images are compressed using the Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) lossless data compression technique and as of 1989 and the GIF89a format can store multiple images in a single stream.  The GIF format uses a palette of up to 256 distinct colors from the 24-bit RGB color space.\n\n__Portable Network Graphics__, or PNG was created in the mid 90's and was created with the intention of improving upon and replacing the GIF format.  The PNG brings to the table the ability to have an alpha channel transparency which gives us a much wider range of transparency options.   The PNG also gives us a much wider range of color depths than GIF (truecolor up to 48-bit compared to 8-bit 245-color), which allows for greater color precision and smoother fades..etc..  In just about every way the PNG is superior to the GIF, save one.  PNG's do not support storing multiple images in a single file.\n\n__Joint Photographic Experts Group__, or JPEG was a group who got together and issued a graphical standard (of the same name) back in the early 90's.  It's commonly used for compressing photographic images and allows for an adjustable degree of compression.  This adjustment gives the user a tradeoff between storage size and image quality.\n\n__In my opinion__,  any more for your small graphics I'd use PNG.  PNG's are far superior to GIF's in that they can achieve greater compression, have a \"cleaner\" compression algorithm, have wider range of color, more transparency options, and are very easy to work with.\n\nThe PNG's major down fall was it's lack of full support from Microsoft -- hell they used to crash IE4..  However, as of IE7 support is native (with full alpha transparency) and once IE6 hits its end of life (which I personally think needed to happen back in August of 2001) there really is only one reason to use a GIF and that's for animations.  (Though in all likelihood you'll see an influx of browsers supporting MNGs natively in the near future which is the PNG extension that supports animations.)\n\nFor any large color intense image (photographs) use a JPEG.\n\nIt really is that simple..\n\nIf you're aiming for IE6 and absolutely need to use a transparent PNG you can use various IE PNG fixs JS hacks to make them work -- though what a pain.  If you don't need the transparency just use a GIF.\n","previous":{"next":{"path":"_posts/2008-06-23-which-format-to-use-gif-jpeg-png.md","url":"/which-format-to-use-gif-jpeg-png/","relative_path":"_posts/2008-06-23-which-format-to-use-gif-jpeg-png.md","id":"/which-format-to-use-gif-jpeg-png","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Software Development"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Which format to use; Gif, Jpeg, Png","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2008/06/pngdemo.png","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-06-23 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"which-format-to-use-gif-jpeg-png","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2008-06-19-oh-dear-god-ew.md","output":null,"content":"<a href=\"/images/2008/06/blclamato.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" class=\"fancybox\"><img class=\"pull-right\" title=\"Bud light and Clamato\" src=\"/images/2008/06/blclamato.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>\n\nI go on a lot of walks here in my neighborhood in order to unwind for the day.  I also like to delude myself and say its exercise but lets be honest, 3 miles every other day aint going to do much.\n\nWhile out on one of my walks I ran across a 40oz bud light beer can that some asshat had probably tossed out of his car, laying on the side of the road.  I didn't pay it any mind and kept walking but something about it was out of the ordinary so I actually turned around and walked back to look..  It was a can of \"Chelada\".\n\nMy immediate and audible response was, \"Oh dear god..Ew!\"..  Yes.. that's right boys and girls.. thats bud light and clamato juice, in the same can.  Evidently its been out for about a year now but that is the first time I have seen it and it sounds nasty!  I mean the last damn thing I want in my beer is shellfish..\n\nSeriously who drinks this?  This sounds absolutely vile and makes \"New Coke\" sound like a good idea.. \n\nI'll answer my own question actually..
