I sort of waffled back and forth as to whether or not to get the iPhone or the N95..  The decision was very much made for me when they announced the SDK for the iPhone back in January of 2008, and I got one a day or two later..  I found out that the <a href=\"/iphone-its-not-all-hype/\" target=\"_self\">iPhone wasn't all hype</a> and that I seriously made the right choice.. The N95 is a good device but now that I have handled both, I can say that the iPhone was superior in the one way that mattered the most;  the interface.\n\nI continue to use just about all of the features of my iPhone on a daily basis and can honestly say it's one of the most useful tools I have ever owned..  I have loved this device.. When the <a href=\"/3g-iphone/\" target=\"_self\">3G iPhone</a> came out I briefly had some unfaithful thoughts and considered upgrading but to be honest I just didn't feel the improvements were enough to warrant the cost even though it was only $200..  I passed..   Then the 3Gs came out and again, I didn't see the advantage.. Sure a few extra go faster stripes, but just not that big of an improvement..  Pass again..\n\nWith each iteration of the OS, they continue to upgrade the first generation device in lock step with the later generations which I felt was a really good thing to do.  I personally believe that you should never, ever cripple your hardware through software.   If a device can do a thing, it should be allowed to do a thing..  And it appeared they weren't crippling their older device just so you would upgrade... Until it became apparent that they were doing just that..\n\nThe irony of course is that Apple is sort of known for doing exactly that and yet I still bought in..   The iPhone has been wonderful and will likely continue to be wonderful as a device, but the more I use it and the deeper I get into the user experience as well as the developers experience the more I realize that there are a lot of limitations in place.  Some of those were put there by Apple intentionally to get you to upgrade to the latest revision of the hardware..  And that's shitty..\n\nI recently purchased a very nice <a href=\"/hardware-review-sony-dr-bt21g-wireless-bluetooth-stereo-headset/\" target=\"_self\">bluetooth stereo headset</a> with the intention of using them with my phone..  However Apple has disabled the A2DP bluetooth profile on the first generation iPhone..  Just 'cause..   The phone certainly can do it, it's a software profile not a hardware difference but they decided do turn that feature off.   They also didn't enable MMS for the first generation iPhone even though I'm pretty sure we were promised that along with everyone else.. again that simply sucks..  Don't even get me started on the \"new\" voice activation shit the new 3Gs can do and that my p910a could do 5 years ago..   I can say that this sort of thing has made me pretty angry at Apple..\n\nI am also somewhat annoyed with AT&amp;T of late as their network is completely and totally hozed.  A buddy of mine that works for AT&amp;T said their network in the Austin area is something like 400% saturated and yet are forced (by the consumer) to continue to add new features like the recently added MMS stuff..  3G is great if the network actually has bandwidth..  When my phone first came out the Edge network (2G) worked fine.. sure it was a tad slow but it worked... NOW it doesn't work at all because they have throttled it down to nothing trying to eek out more 3G bandwidth to support the customer demand..   So while previously my wife with her 3G iPhone would load a webpage in 30 seconds that would take me a minute to load, now her phone can sometimes load it in a minute and mine times out every time.. So effectively my iPhone's network is gone.. (Depends largely on the time of day.. )\n\nI had told my wife that I was going to get the next version of the iPhone.. whatever came after the 3Gs.. I told her that the 3Gs was tempting but wasn't quite better enough to warrant the cost and that I normally hang on to a device for 2 or so years before upgrading anyway..  So whatever Apple came out with next would do me..  I assumed at the time I said this that Apple would continue to actually support my device in the form of upgrades..  Now I'm less sure of this..\n\nIn my mind they have intentionally crippled the first generation iPhone such that I can't use stereo bluetooth, MMS or the new Voice activation stuff even though the hardware supports it..   And that's shitty..  And all so I would rush out and purchase the latest hardware..  (Which I couldn't do anyway in the case of the 3G because I was contractually obligated to AT&amp;T..)\n\nSo.. Now I'm forced to consider alternatives..  Or rather not forced, but am shopping for alternatives because Apple &amp; AT&amp;T has pissed me off..  Their business tactics smack of greed and I just don't like that..\n\nAnd while my iPhone still very much works and for the most part still does everything I need, I would like to get a new phone simply for the newer abilities that are out there..   The problem was the iPhone (even the original one) set the bar extremely high..  The interface just wins.. The application store system works very nicely and is a huge win for both developers and customers alike..  The native applications all work extremely well, are user friendly and functional.. etc.. it's gonna be tough finding something that works as well and has the features and functionality of even my crippled phone..\n\n<img class=\"pull-right\" title=\"SEXperia\" src=\"/images/2009/11/SEXperia.jpg\" alt=\"SEXperia\" width=\"189\" height=\"348\" />Or so I thought..  I had looked into quite a few different devices, most of them were either the latest Symbian or Android style phones.. None of them really did what I wanted.. the form factor was just all wrong in most cases..  They had unnecessary things like slider keyboards or just uncomfortable shapes, or they weren't enough of a convergence device..\n\nThen a co-worker pointed out the <a href=\"http://www.sonyericsson.com/cws/products/mobilephones/overview/xperiax10a?lc=en&amp;cc=us\" target=\"_blank\">Xperia X10 by Sony Ericsson</a>.   Wow..  It's not out yet, but the <a href=\"http://www.sonyericsson.com/cws/products/mobilephones/specifications/xperiax10a?lc=en&amp;cc=us\" target=\"_blank\">specs are available online</a> and I must say I'm impressed..  I have a fairly high opinion of the SE line of devices.. The p910a was a great device for its day.. I really had zero complaints about it and think back on it fondly..\n\nIn my opinion, the quality of the iPhone where the physical device is concerned is pretty high.. It doesn't feel flimsy for easily breakable even though the whole front of it is glass.. It has a nice weight to it and it's comfortable to hold..  The only thing I don't like physically about the iPhone is the volume is really low by comparison to some of my other phones (the Nokia Communicator I owned was so loud I had to hold it away from my head..)\n\nI'm seriously hoping that the the Xperia phone matches the iPhone for physical quality..  If it does then it's a shoe in for my next device..  ALL of the spec's for this device beat my first generation iPhone by a landslide..  Plus it appears to have the same touch screen style interface and it's an \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_%28operating_system%29\" target=\"_blank\">Android</a>\" with 1ghz processor?!   Christ it's a phone that's more powerful than my first two IBM PCs combined..\n\nThe biggest complaint most folks have is that it doesn't have a keyboard..  Are you fucking kidding me?  I just don't understand that..  I used to think a keyboard would be nice until I had a device that had one and never used it..  Once I got used to the iPhone style of on screen keyboard I was done with physical keys..  Touch screen is where it's at folks..  Real keyboards in a device this size are simply not practical nor are they useful...\n\nThe real big complaint is that this phone will likely cost around $800... or more...\n\nEither way I think this phone is it.. It's still a ways out yet though.. it's slated to be released in \"the first half of 2010\" which knowing SE will be the very last day of that time frame or pushed back later.. heh\n\nI'm also not entirely sure about the UI code named \"Rachel\" by Sony Ericsson..\n\n*link removed*\n\nLooks good to me!  It's getting bashed by a lot of folks for some reason though.. I think it's very pretty and seems fully functional.. *shrug*  I dunno why people hate it so much.. I guess change is scary.. They may just want the row after row of icons and nothing else..\n\nThe other complaint is that it's being shipped with android 1.6 instead of 2.0 which people can't understand.. I think that decision has a lot to do with the development cycle.. The phone has likely been in development for a while now and its currently written on 1.6.. When does 2.0 come out?   They would have to completely rewrite to get 2.0 crammed in there at the last second before the phone was due to be released..  I think by writing it on 1.6 they get the software down pat and can then release the 2.0 version in a upgrade down the road..   Quality folks.. they want the OS to work the first time around..\n\nI can appreciate that..  I'd take a stable 1.6 over a buggy 2.0 package anyday..\n\nAnyway.. that's it.. This thing looks hot.. Here is another video of the music player and photo viewer.. Looks great..\n\n*link removed*\n\nI'll keep you posted.\n","collection":"posts","url":"/xperia-x10-my-next-phone/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2009-11-14-game-review-dragon-age-origins.md","collection":"posts","url":"/game-review-dragon-age-origins/","path":"_posts/2009-11-14-game-review-dragon-age-origins.md","id":"/game-review-dragon-age-origins","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Game Review: Dragon Age - Origins","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2009/11/dragonageoriginslogo.png","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-11-14 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"game-review-dragon-age-origins","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2009-11-07-xperia-x10-my-next-phone.md","excerpt":"On June 27th, 2007 (shortly after I got married) the iPhone came out..

I played that game until my eyes bled, sought healing and then played it some more..\n\nSo when Dragon Age was announced at E3 way back in 2004 I was stoked..  Finally a spiritual successor to Baldur's Gate done in a completely new style with modern graphics, fully voice acted and by the same developer.. *Gleeeee* I anticipated more costly eye healing.. As I was sure to play that game as much as I played Baldur's Gate..\n\nAnd then we waited.. and waited.. and waited..  Set the way forward machine now to 5 fricken years later... And FINALLY we have the game to play..\n\nAnd it's pure liquid awesome.. but I get ahead of myself..\n\nI have to admit I think most game companies release information about their games way too early.. Bioware is extremely guilty of this and they still haven't learned their lesson..  They released information about Neverwinter Nights way too early and it caused this massive hypefest that dwindled down to sarcastic jokes and disappointment by the time the game was finally released..  I don't know for sure but I am more than willing to put money on the fact that it hurt their sales..\n\nIt also hurt them that Neverwinter Nights just couldn't live up to type hype that was generated.. It was supposed to be a new kind of awesome, and it simply wasn't.   Dragon Age on the otherhand didn't get quite as much hype and it deserved it!  It's a really good game.. I mean.. it's stunningly good..  It's quite possibly one of the best games I have ever played, and let me tell ya -- that's saying something..\n\nFirstly, the game is beautiful.. Their engine is really coming along nicely and it serves the game extremely well..  Plus it's not a CPU hog.. I play the game at 1920x1200 on a dual monitor system at max graphics 8xAA and get a solid 60 frames per second.. (I have v-sync turned on)..\n\nSecondly, the entire game is voice acted.. and well too..  I like that.. suddenly you don't have to read tedious story lines for hours and hours just to get some concept of whats going on in the game..\n\nThirdly, the game is fricken huge!!  They say it has 200 hours of play time, but I think it's more.. I know I haven't played 200 hours yet, but I have done quite a bit and my character isn't 20% through the game yet .. (there is a stat that tells you how far you have gone).. Plus the way they have added downloadable content was clever so the game is forever expandable.. More over, when they announced the name change from \"Dragon Age\" to \"Dragon Age: Origins\" it sort of let us know that they have a lot of plans for this engine.  I anticipate quite a lot of new games / expansions to be released under the Dragon Age title..  But not only that, I am willing to bet that the new games (say for example the new Star Wars MMO) will use this engine too..\n\nFinally, the game has good re-playability.. This game is basically 6 games in one in that you can play through it six times and have six different experiences.. Each \"Origin\" gives you a whole new perspective on the game and its cool..\n\nI have a ton more I could talk about, like how the tactic system is cool and how the game can be played over the shoulder or isometric..etc.. But posting about this stuff is keeping me from actually playing the game and that just wont do..  Look.. go get the game.. this is one game that you must go get..\n","collection":"posts","url":"/game-review-dragon-age-origins/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2009-11-14-game-review-dragon-age-origins.md","collection":"posts","url":"/game-review-dragon-age-origins/","path":"_posts/2009-11-14-game-review-dragon-age-origins.md","id":"/game-review-dragon-age-origins","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Game Review: Dragon Age - Origins","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2009/11/dragonageoriginslogo.png","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-11-14 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"game-review-dragon-age-origins","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2009-11-15-games-workshop-warhammer-fantasy-the-new-skaven.md","content":"<img class=\"pull-right\" title=\"Skaven\" src=\"/images/2009/11/skaven-head.jpg\" alt=\"Skaven\" width=\"270\" height=\"286\" />\n\nI have been a Skaven player since the early 1990's.  They were the second fantasy army I got into after Orcs &amp; Goblins.  Once I found the blessing of the horned rat however, my love of all things green didn't last very long..   The Skaven were here to stay!  I love these little guys..

I mean I know the army is bound to be more powerful than the current armies are simply because it's the latest army..   That's just the way of things.. Games Workshop is a company in the business to make money and the way to do that is to make the lastest revision just a smidge better than previous ones so folks will flock to it.. But having said that, I like that they army is back to being quite self destructive..\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2009/11/doomwheel1.jpg\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"New Doomwheel\" src=\"/images/2009/11/doomwheel1-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"New Doomwheel\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>New Doomwheel</span></a>\n\nFirstly, they have added the doomwheel back to the roster.. Something they completely omitted from the last book entirely.. Not only did they bring it back in the new book but they released a new model for it and its great!\n\nI still have my old doomwheel model on the shelf where its sat for the last 10 years or so not getting played.. and when I read that the new book would have a doomwheel I blew off the dust getting it ready for play..  Then I saw the new model.. Holy crap.. Yeah okay.. back on the shelf you go.. I'm getting the new on and painting it.. (See image)\n\nPlus it's all plastic!  Yay!\n\nI remember the day when the metal models were all way more detailed than anything they could come up with in plastic, but those days are long gone.. Give me plastic all the way..  Well it appears GW has heard our pleas and is intending to release all new models for the Skaven..   They have already put out a number of them, with a few more in the wings to come out.\n\nPlus the codex has a bunch of new units that they will have to produce models for sooner or later so I expect even more..\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2009/11/stormvermin01.jpg\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Stormvermin Before and After\" src=\"/images/2009/11/stormvermin01-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Stormvermin Before and After\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Stormvermin Before and After</span></a>\n\nThe new stormvermin plastic kit is fantastic.. Gone are the days of having to purchase a buttload of individually packed blisters at$15 each just to have a 20 model unit.. The new stormvermin box comes with everything you need to have a fully functional unit of 20 models..\n\nThey paint up nicely and the dip method works perfectly on Skaven.  Click the before and after picture to see what I'm talking about.  That model was painted in about 15 minutes.. I did what I can only call a slap/dash job of painting him with basic colors and then performed the magical \"dip\" at which point he came out looking great.\n\nAdd to the mix the WAY over the top new characters and warmachines and you have one powerful army..  I look forward to building a force to play with..  The only down side is it looks like I will have to repurpose all my old models as they aren't what I would build now..  The up side is, I now have more slaves than I know what to do with..\n","collection":"posts","url":"/games-workshop-warhammer-fantasy-the-new-skaven/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2009-11-16-hardware-review-lightscribe-cddvd-burners.md","collection":"posts","url":"/hardware-review-lightscribe-cddvd-burners/","path":"_posts/2009-11-16-hardware-review-lightscribe-cddvd-burners.md","id":"/hardware-review-lightscribe-cddvd-burners","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Hardware Review: Lightscribe CD/DVD Burners","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2009/11/592px-CDLabelLightScribe_WikipediaLogo.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-11-16 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"hardware-review-lightscribe-cddvd-burners","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2009-11-15-games-workshop-warhammer-fantasy-the-new-skaven.md","excerpt":"I have been a Skaven player since the early 1990's.  They were the second fantasy army I got into after Orcs &amp; Goblins.  Once I found the blessing of the horned rat however, my love of all things green didn't last very long..   The Skaven were here to stay!","id":"/games-workshop-warhammer-fantasy-the-new-skaven","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Games Workshop -- Warhammer Fantasy: The new Skaven","layout":"post","tags":["Warhammer"],"image":"/images/2009/11/skaven-head.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-11-15 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"games-workshop-warhammer-fantasy-the-new-skaven","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2009-11-16-hardware-review-lightscribe-cddvd-burners.md","content":"<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2009/11/592px-CDLabelLightScribe_WikipediaLogo.jpg\" class=\"fancybox\"><img title=\"LightScribe Label Example\" src=\"/images/2009/11/592px-CDLabelLightScribe_WikipediaLogo-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"LightScribe Label Example\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>LightScribe Label Example</span></a>\n\nBack in 2004 Hewlett-Packard engineer Daryl Anderson had the notion that if you can burn data on to a disc, why couldn't use use that same technology to burn the label?  And thus the LightScribe burner was born..\n\nI had always wanted to pick one of these suckers up and never got around to it because I already had a CD/DVD +/- burner and didn't need a new one..  I couldn't reason the cost of getting a second burner when I didn't really use the one I had all that often..\n\nWell about 4 months ago my old burner went off into the weeds and never came back, enabling me to buy a Lightscribe external burner and bid all my labeling woe's goodbye! Sorta..\n\nI don't want to claim the label burning idea as my own, but I have to admit I had the same idea several times after many an hour of trying to get some form of \"pretty\" label into my CD's without completely throwing them out of balance..   And I am opt'ing to review the technology as a whole, not an individual burner..  They will all work about the same..\n\nSo, with that I have to say the burner itself is excellent.. I have had zero dead discs (discs that just fail for no reason during the burn process) and it is pretty darn fast at burning the disk data..  My old burner would have dead discs all the time and was slow as hell by comparison..  This is likely just due to the new 16x burner being a generation (or two?) newer than my old one..\n\nSo.. the long and short of it is, when it comes to burning your data -- it works just fine.  But that's not the real reason I purchased it.. I want a device that can burn labels so that I don't have to use stickers, a special printer or even (god forbid) a sharpie..\n\nStickers tend to throw the disc out of balance which at modern high drive speeds can be a bad thing.. Special printers can be pricey (though the new ones that print right on the disc do a nice job) and the require inks, and in some cases label stickers..  And if I have to resort to a sharpie no one will know what is on the darn disc cause my hand writing is horrible..\n\nSo this is where the technology is supposed to really shine and it does to a point but I have some complaints..\n\nFirstly, let me say it's awesome being able to photoshop up some labels and just burn them to the disc..  The Lightscribe folks have even put together a software package that allows you to cobble together labels from preexisting templates, with lots and lots of other templates downloadable off their website..\n\nThat's nice..\n\nBut (complaint #1) it's ungodly slow..  It takes something like 6 minutes to burn an ISO with this 16x burner? I don't know the exact time but it's pretty darn fast.. It then takes about 35 minutes to burn the label..  Why does it take so long?\n\nThat wouldn't be too bad if it weren't for the fact that (complaint #2) the label is extremely light or faded and hard to read.  Folks on one forum I browsed were joking that we have to wait for the \"DarkScribe\" burner to come out before the labels will be easy to read..  Frankly the contrast ratio is extremely poor..  For the amount of time it took, it should produce a much sharper image than it does.. Apparently this is something new to the 16x discs and the old 8x discs didn't do this..\n\nAlso, I haven't tested this yet but I'm told all you have to do is burn the label multiple times in order for it to be easier to read.. that means though that you have to suffer that 35 minute label burn several times.. Bleh..  Apparently around the center of each disc there is a barcode that allows the drive to know the precise rotational position of the disc, enabling multiple burns..\n\nAnd finally, (complaint #3) apparently you have to take special storage precautions with the discs or else the labels will fade..  Seriously?!\n\nI don't know how bad the fading can get as the labels seem somewhat faded right out of the burner..  I think any amount of fading would render the label unreadable in fairly short order..\n\nSo.. there you have it.. I love the technology but the fact that it's Slow as hell, Faded unless burned multiple times, and Can fade further seems like some pretty stiff drawbacks..\n\nSuddenly the printer that can print directly on the disc, in color no less, seems like a better option..   (Yeah lightscribe can't do color)..  One thing I was surprised by was the cost of the media..  Lightscribe discs used to be a lot more expensive than regular CD/DVD's.. that isn't the case any longer.. So yay for that..\n\nAll in all I'm happy with the purchase and would recommend the burner, but you have to understand that you will need to burn the label a couple times to get a good looking label with any contrast to it..\n","collection":"posts","url":"/hardware-review-lightscribe-cddvd-burners/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2009-11-16-hardware-review-lightscribe-cddvd-burners.md","collection":"posts","url":"/hardware-review-lightscribe-cddvd-burners/","path":"_posts/2009-11-16-hardware-review-lightscribe-cddvd-burners.md","id":"/hardware-review-lightscribe-cddvd-burners","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Hardware Review: Lightscribe CD/DVD Burners","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2009/11/592px-CDLabelLightScribe_WikipediaLogo.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-11-16 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"hardware-review-lightscribe-cddvd-burners","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2009-12-09-play-the-radio-2.md","content":"<img title=\"Electric Violin\" src=\"/images/2009/12/eviolin-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Electric Violin\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" class='pull-right' />\n\nSo I had said previously that my musical talent ended pretty much at the ability to <a href=\"/play-the-radio/\" target=\"_self\">play the radio</a>, and that I hated that..  I wrote that entry back in July of '08 and I still hate it..\n\nI have been looking around for ideas of what to play and am still undecided.. I have a nice piano so my investment there at this point would be only time, but I am not interested in it -- it still doesn't inspire me..  I still like the idea of the Chapman stick but the cost is just unreasonable and frankly the alternative is not as pretty (yes that matters) not to mention they have horrible business tactics which I don't appreciate..\n\nI thought about getting a guitar and may still do that as there's a ton of info out there for free as well as an awesome assortment of equipment.. So baring anything else.. I'll do that.. I can get a guitar on the cheap and I have 4 or 5 friends that have offered to loan me an instrument..\n\nHaving said that, of late a coworker of mine has gotten me interested in learning the violin or viola..   Plus I have done a lot of looking online and I have to admit they look fun..  The concept of an electric violin appeals to me.. hehe\n\nI think I like the sound of the viola more than that of the violin but it seems to me that everything out there is aimed more at teaching you the violin, and then you convert that knowledge to the viola or the cello..  As I understand it the knowledge transfers quit easily and I wouldn't be surprised if way back in history \"Violin\" translates to \"small Viola\".. heh\n\nWhat's really funny is I like the idea of an electric violin the most.. Primarily because I know its something that I could build..  I know.. whacky.. but I'm a damn good carpenter and frankly they don't look hard to build..  I have watched quite a few videos of them being made and to be honest, the only thing I need is the measurements..\n\nNot sure how the sound is picked up though -- it appears to be a crystal in the bridge which makes sense, since unlike an electric guitar there are no metal strings.. Beyond that making sure strings are correctly isolated and that the measurements are sound it seems easy..\n\nI'm not going to rush out of build one of course.. I mean if you can't play it what's the point..\n\nI have purchased several books and am reading up on the violin though as I think it's something I'd like to start doing.. I have wasted enough of my life sans music, it's time to start picking something up..  I found a place here in town that rents very nice violins for as low as $20-$30 a month and they have a looong list of instructors..\n\nI have told the wife of the plans and she seemed opened to it..  Good thing too as I'm sure for a while its going to sound like I'm torturing a cat to death..  I also have looked into various forms of \"muffles\" for violins so that I don't drive her completely insane..\n\nMore reading and video watching though to try to make sure it's what I want to do..\n\nOn a side note;  I have watched a lot of YouTube video's recently of people playing all manner of instruments and I'm just stunned and amazed at the varitey of talent there is out in the world..\n\nSome of you are fantastic!  Some.. not so much.. heh..  Gotta take the good with the bad I suppose..\n\nBut it just amazes me the number of people who record themselves performing their art for others to watch and even critique.. (though to be honest you're better off just closing the \"text comments\" and never ever reading them again.. It's also stunning how completely rude people are considering folks are opening themselves up to constructive comments, not unhelpful bad-mouthing by someone who couldn't even perform to the level they are bashing.)\n\nKelly Iverson (\"The Lady\") and Mark Allen (\"Doc Parsons\") are a fantastic example of people who love what they do and do it for our enjoyment.. they also show nicely that a well played guitar sounds wonderful with a well played violin.. Thanks guys, well done..\n*links removed*\n\nSome of the instruments are .. uh.. odd.. to say the least.. For example, the following is a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyckelharpa\" target=\"_blank\">nyckelharpa</a> and a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurdy_gurdy\" target=\"_blank\">hurdy gurdy</a> duo -- Stick around for the whole thing:\n*links removed*\n\nWasn't that great?!  I mean two instruments that absolutely fill the space with sound.. I'm not sure another instrument would fit in there.. heh\n\nI had never heard of a Nyckelharpa before but apparently it's a traditional Swedish instrument from the 14th century.. Very cool.. There are a lot of youtube videos of people playing them and they are neat..  The hurdy gurdy is I have heard before in person and you really can't appreciate it until you feel the buzz.. It's a wildly expressive instrument.. It's very cool that people not only still play these but are darn good at it..\n\nThere are a lot more examples too of folks willing to put themselves out there.. Kudos to you all..
