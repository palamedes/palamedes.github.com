Turns out that bug had nothing to do with WordPress but was rather an issue with my host.. It's been resolved, but that niggling desire to [create my own blogging software](/my-own-custom-blogging-software/ \"My own custom blogging software\") stuck..\n\nThis is something I wanted to create from the ground up that would be a 100% \"my own\" solution to include even the look&amp;feel theme of the thing and I decided that it would also be 100% open source from the start.\n\nI wanted to use this project as a possible way to expand my horizons but I also wanted something functional that I could use and expand on quickly;  the more I thought (and still think) about this the sooner I wanted off WordPress, not because WordPress is a bad thing (it's not) but because I wanted something that was fully mine that I could modify to my heart's content.\n\nSo with that, I moved forward with my project and started looking at which language I wanted to write it in.   After some consideration I decided to limit myself to writing the code in Python, Ruby, Node, or PHP.\n\nI knew from the get-go that I didn't really want to write this thing in PHP.   PHP is a great language but it's getting a little long in the tooth and frankly some of the frameworks out there leave a lot to be desired.   Plus I have been writing PHP since '96 or so.. I'm ready to move on..\n\n<a href=\"/images/2012/03/rubypress02.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"RubyPress Admin\" src=\"/images/2012/03/rubypress02-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"RubyPress Admin\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>RubyPress Admin</span></a>\n\nSo with my original intent in mind I decided to branch out and try NodeJS as I really like JavaScript and I think node is fairly clever.  I played with node for a couple of weeks even making an initial start on the blogging software and while I do believe Node is pretty cool, I just don't think it's \"quite there\" yet.  I think node has a little bit of growing to do before it's fully matured, which isn't to take away from it at all but rather just my opinion on its current state.  For whatever reason, node didn't excite me.\n\nThis left me in a bit of a pickle;  Suddenly my language options went to Python, Ruby or back to PHP.   At the time I knew nothing about Python or Ruby compared to my PHP knowledge.\n\nI had to do some serious considering here and what I ultimately came back to was one simple fact;  PHP and the myriad of MVC frameworks I've worked with (Zend, Kohana, Cake, Symfony etc...) as well as Python and it's MVC frameworks (Django's really the only one I have any experience with) all do their damnedest to do what Rails is doing.\n\nRails does all the big stuff right out of the box and then you have the whole Gem library thing... dear god.. RoR seems awesome.. okay lets give that a try!  I've never so much as cracked a book on Ruby before so this will be a 100% new thing for me.. *shrug* why not?!  Off to the races I went.\n\nSide note:  I found that [Lynda.com](http://www.lynda.com/) has some nice beginner intro courses on Ruby and Rails and of course Ryan Bates at [Railscasts.com](http://railscasts.com/) has lots of good video information for the watching.. both are totally worth checking out..\n\nNow set the \"not so\" way-forward machine to 10 days later:    I've been working on it for 10 days or so, on and off, and in that amount of time I have created a system that allows me to import content directly from WordPress and display it on the site as seen in the screenshot above using my new theme.    I can create users, posts, pages, messages, have a functional (if sparse yet) admin area that forces authentication etc..  and they all work!\n\nSo, in 10 days using a language and framework I don't know and have never used before,  using plugins and modules I don't know and have never used before, even a brand new IDE..  etc..  I have managed to implement the core functionality of WordPress..    Holy crap, Ruby and Rails are easy as hell..   Seriously this stuff writes itself..  (I'm using [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) and [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) which I think are both brilliant and likely will be using CanCan and a few other gems as I need them. )\n\nI'm jokingly calling this project \"RubyPress\", more as a codename than a real product name since it's now become a Ruby blogging software to replace WordPress..\n\nI have no idea if it will grow beyond my getting the basic blogging functionality working.. I still have a lot of stuff that are requirements like categories, tags, theme support..etc..  Lots and lots to do.. but I'm really enjoying it, and learning Rails at the same time.. so win win..   There is still a lot of \"magic\" to Ruby for me, stuff that I'm not sure how or why it works the way it does..etc.. but slowly I'm getting it..  I'm sure this thing will require a dozen rewrites before it's not embarrassing.. heh  What can I say.. I'm a Ruby and Rails noob.. bear with me..\n\nThough I have to admin, it's coming together so quickly that I do entertain the notion of having something that might one day actually compete with WordPress.. WordPress itself has been around since 2003 and has a lot of very cool functionality that I doubt I'll ever match in my little toy project, but wouldn't it be fun?  =D\n\nIt is 100% open source; [https://github.com/palamedes/Press](https://github.com/palamedes/Press)\n\nI will keep working on it and eventually have something worth using I hope..  For now I'm still on WordPress..\n","collection":"posts","url":"/rubypress-wordpress-replacement/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2012-11-05-wow-its-really-been-a-while.md","collection":"posts","url":"/wow-its-really-been-a-while/","path":"_posts/2012-11-05-wow-its-really-been-a-while.md","id":"/wow-its-really-been-a-while","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"layout":"post","title":"wow it's really been a while","tags":[],"published":true,"type":"post","image":"/images/2013/01/beenawhile.jpg","gallery":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2012-11-05 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"wow-its-really-been-a-while","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2012-03-26-rubypress-wordpress-replacement.md","excerpt":"So a while back I had thought my WordPress install was getting exploited through some bug and decided I wanted to write my own replacement...","id":"/rubypress-wordpress-replacement","draft":false,"categories":["Software Development"],"layout":"post","title":"RubyPress Wordpress Replacement","tags":["Ruby","Ruby on Rails","WordPress"],"published":true,"type":"post","image":"/images/2012/03/rubypress01-150x150.jpg","gallery":null,"ribbon":"ruby","allow_comments":true,"private":false,"date":"2012-03-26 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"rubypress-wordpress-replacement","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2012-11-05-wow-its-really-been-a-while.md","content":"Hey guys, I'm went dark for quite some time apparently and I didn't really mean to let this much time passed since my last post.\n\nLife is been incredibly busy for me; I feel like I'm working three or four different jobs, playing three or four different games, waiting for a bunch of things that happen and ultimately I want to move the hell out of Texas.\n\nI'm still working on my own blogging solution, it's coming along nicely it's just not quite ready for prime time yet. More than anything I'm learning about Ruby and programming in the Ruby on rails environment. I'm sure once all is said and done all have a decent product to share with the world, but it still just too early to release. (Even though you can actually get it online right now it might github account -- I would avoid doing so for the time being.)\n\nI've actually made a couple posts on my new blogging system, and those will become available once my blogging system goes live but I haven't bothered import them into WordPress yet and probably won't.\n\nMelissa and I are still very much wanting to move out of Texas and go to someplace like Tennessee or Georgia. We've been doing a lot of research and have some areas in mind; right now were looking at Blue Ridge Georgia. It's a very beautiful area with a lot of resort like cabins and whatnot and I honestly can't wait to live there. However, we have to wait for David weekly to get off their ass and actually correct what's wrong with our house --  We are still fighting that seven-year long fight with them regarding our foundation issues. It's an endless battle and to be honest I'm really tired of it -- I just want it all to go away.\n\nBut towards that end, we started cleaning up the house and started moving things out that we don't want here when we do show the house.  Here soon I will contact a couple different realtors and have them come out and tell us what we need to do in order to proceed. here today or tomorrow, I'm going to get a storage unit so that the decrapification of the house may continue.\n\nI'm trying to think of what else is going on.\n\nI'm starting to get that really weird foot pain again. I have those orthotics that the doctor gave me but to be honest those damn things hurt me more then not wearing them. I think ultimately I just need some new shoes, my tennis shoes are really rather old at this point.\n\nSome friends and I are looking at creating our own little video/audio blogging podcast around the programming we do in projects that we want to participate in. More than anything it's going to be four guys talking to one another just, fucking around but it's going be a lot of fun. I doubt anyone will seriously watch it, more than anything is just a fun way for us to keep in touch and goof off. But to that end I went ahead and purchased a really nice podcasting microphone. I have it hooked up on a boom mic stand and everything so that it sticks right in front of my mouth and can easily be pushed out of the way when I don't need it.\n\nSo for grins I went ahead and got a copy of Dragon natural speaking so that I can do some dictation. I figure that if I'm going to get this really nice microphone and get it set up to do this podcasting thing I might as well kill two birds with one stone and get the dictation software that I've always wanted to try so that I can give it a whack.\n\nI have to admit I'm really rather impressed; Dragon NaturallySpeaking is really fucking cool. Everything you see in this post was actually dictated directly from word-of-mouth to the WordPress text box with very little editing done post process. (it just wouldn't recognize \"decrapification\" since it's not a real word and I'm still trying to figure out how to train that word in.. heh)\n\nI knew that there was a lot of really good dictation software out there but I had no concept that it was this good.\n\nThe other nice thing about this dictation solution is that it will likely encourage me to create more posts and updates.\n\nAnyway that's all for now I'll try to be better about updating sorry took so long -- not that anyone actually reads this.. I have to admit this stuff is more for me than anyone else.\n","collection":"posts","url":"/wow-its-really-been-a-while/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2012-11-05-wow-its-really-been-a-while.md","collection":"posts","url":"/wow-its-really-been-a-while/","path":"_posts/2012-11-05-wow-its-really-been-a-while.md","id":"/wow-its-really-been-a-while","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"layout":"post","title":"wow it's really been a while","tags":[],"published":true,"type":"post","image":"/images/2013/01/beenawhile.jpg","gallery":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2012-11-05 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"wow-its-really-been-a-while","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2012-11-07-electoral-college-versus-popular-vote.md","content":"So, with the 2012 presidential election finally over, I'd like to discuss some of the things that I saw during the whole shebang.\n\nI noticed at one point during the process Mitt Romney had more popular vote than Barack Obama but at the same time Barack Obama had more electoral votes  which made me wonder if the popular vote actually matters at all.\n\nI did a bunch of research that harkens back to my 20 plus years ago social study courses because I simply didn't remember the purpose of the electoral college with regards to the popular vote.\n\nThe electoral college was implemented in order to represent the population of a given state before people could travel to the election sites and actually cast ballots.

It was a pretty tall undertaking to begin with and I was doing it in a language that I had just learned..  A bit of a lofty goal to be honest..  Doable, but the motivation wasn't really there..\n\nI didn't really feel any pressing issue as wordpress was working just fine -- but then I really thought about it and I realized that WP wasn't working just fine for me.. infact, I had pretty much stopped using it entirely due to its various issues and my particular feelings about it.  I was no longer updating my blog at all and that was starting to go against the grain..\n\nTo be frank, I was tired of the design and the lack of flexibility, it's bloat, it's poor performance and it's constant security issues..  I think WP is a fine solution if you have no technical chops and I think its place on the web has been thoroughly earned, but for me I just didn't want to have to fight with it any more.\n\nI wanted to write some stuff for it and I've been working exclusively in Ruby for the past year and a half, so I was not really interested in working on something written in PHP, a language that now officially considers me an apostate.\n\nI also noticed that every damn time I logged in there were new hacks or exploits injected into it that hadn't been there previously..  My server is hardened yet people still manage to find ways to exploit WP to put their crap in my blog..  So I was tired of it constantly getting exploited and having to fight that fight was very draining only disincentivized me even more.\n\nI examined what I was trying to do with my blog and started to shop around for ruby solutions;  Enter Jekyll.\n\nJekyll is \"a simple, blog aware, static site generator\" that's written entirely in Ruby that allows me to write my blog entries in simple markdown and export the whole thing using Git to deploy.\n\nI was putting a lot of time, effort and code into a blogging solution that was basically a replacement for wordpress, but it solved all the same problems in exactly the same way -- just in a different language..  That doesn't make sense and it was a bad idea from the start..\n\nAlso one of the directions I was going was to have it so that my dynamic blogging solution would output git pages statically..  Well, why do I need the dynamic blog at all then?!\n\nThe best part is, I can just host it on Github itself, or Amazone S3 for pennies.  And all the files are static, so there is no blog to hack.  There is no back end code to exploit.  Oh and if you do manage to break it or wipe it out, I just redeploy.  Done.\n\nReally it is the best solution out there for this and I'm very excited about using it.\n\n","collection":"posts","url":"/blogging-like-its-1999/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2013-02-01-blogging-like-its-1999.md","collection":"posts","url":"/blogging-like-its-1999/","path":"_posts/2013-02-01-blogging-like-its-1999.md","id":"/blogging-like-its-1999","draft":false,"categories":["Software Development"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Blogging like its 1999!","layout":"post","tags":["Ruby"],"image":"/images/2013/01/jekyll.png","gallery":null,"ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2013-02-01 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"blogging-like-its-1999","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2013-02-27-i-want-to-fly.md","content":"<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2013/02/da42-01.jpg\" class=\"pull-right fancybox\"><img title=\"Diamond DA42 Twinstar\" src=\"/images/2013/02/da42-01.jpg\" alt=\"Diamond DA42 Twinstar\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Diamond DA42 Twinstar</span></a>\n\n<audio controls class='pull-right'>\n  <source src=\"/images/2013/02/i-want-to-fly.ogg\" type=\"audio/ogg\" />\n</audio>\n\nSomething I have always wanted to do was learn to fly.  When I was in the military in 1991 I had an opportunity through the USO to take advantage of a small flight training program where I got to spend some time in the little Cessna 152 & tool around the airports in the Bay Area in California and it was a wonderful experience.\n\nUnfortunately I could not afford it.. Anyone who lives in the military or is in the military knows that your privates and PFCs and what not -- they just don't get paid very much and I was no exception, I did not get very much money.\n\nSo ultimately when it came down to pursuing this past time it was kind of a dream; it's  something that I wanted to do, I was desperate to do it but I just couldn't afford it.  There was no way for me to make it happen.\n\nWhile now, set the way forward machine to 30 years later, (er 20 years later sorry terrible math) and I kind of have an opportunity to do it and I also have the income and desire.\n\nSo, I figured what the hell this is something that I would like to go ahead and start doing.  So I have been shopping around online looking for potential flight schools and just get a feeling for what I need to know.  I've also purchased some books from smarties or sorry, sporty's rather, so I can look it you may be doing some training ground school training outside the classrooms so I don't have to pay somebody else --  if nothing else it will be a refresher.\n\nThere is nothing  there is no competing with an actual teacher so having an instructor there will invalueable but maybe going into the classroom with a little bit of education under your belt, that that's not a bad thing so I figure that's 200 dollars well spent.\n And I'll read those videos er read those booklets and watch the videos thoroughly before I go but I have to admit one of the things that really made me want to do this was I was browsing online for just different planes and I mean just looking.. I wasn't really shopping per se I was just looking to see what kind of cool planes were out there lately and I.. I fell in love.. found a plane that I think is just beautiful.\n\nThat's the Diamond DA42 Twinstar, it is it is a sexy sexy plane.\n\nWhat a wonderful looking machine and and I've watched many videos on YouTube and and reviews and it's amazing to me how far the technology has come and the full glass cockpit that those long sweeping wings it almost looks like a glider.  The diesel engines, diesel engines! No kidding and I just,  it's amazing machine and I got to be honest with you...\n\nI want one of those. It's a $650,000 airplane. It's not very likely that I'll get one anytime soon.. (taking donations by the way .. kidding) but uh so yeah, there ya go.   It's something I've always wanted to do, something I'm very keen on and I think I want to go forward.  So I'll keep you posted. I'll let ya know..","collection":"posts","url":"/i-want-to-fly/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2013-04-02-google-chrome-reload-options.md","collection":"posts","url":"/google-chrome-reload-options/","path":"_posts/2013-04-02-google-chrome-reload-options.md","id":"/google-chrome-reload-options","draft":false,"categories":["Software Development"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Google chrome reload options","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2013/04/google-chrome-hard-refresh.png","gallery":null,"ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2013-04-02 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"google-chrome-reload-options","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2013-02-27-i-want-to-fly.md","excerpt":"Something I have always wanted to do was learn to fly.
