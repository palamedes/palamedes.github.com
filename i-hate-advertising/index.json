Story after story about how several planes were hi-jacked and how two of which were intentionally crashed into the World Trade Center. Time and time again from lowly news reporter up to the President, they call it a cowardly act. And I agree.. It was.. But this isn't middle school.. Our calling them a coward wont goad them into revealing their guilt. So the question is, what do we do now? Personally I think its time we heal and cry for our dead..\n\nI know people that say we should bomb all of whomever the guilty parties are into a self lighting glass parking lot. And while we certainly have the power and resources to do that, would that solve anything? Or would it simply fuel the Anti-American sentiment that is prevalent in so many of the countries of the world?\n\nThe real problem is not the fighting of terrorism. If you kill the terrorist, there will always be 2 or 3 more to step up in his place. The news says we aren't fighting the terrorists as much as we are fighting their ideas. And if it were ideas then that would be fine as ideas can be changed. But this isn't the case either.. We are fighting beliefs.. Those aren't as easily changed.. So again, what do we do now? Do we take on their tactics and simply blow them up to prove our point.. I dunno.. I like the idea of letting those that want to live a certain way, live that way. I have no intention of forcing my beliefs on anyone.. But now we are at an impasse, as they (the terrorists) are forcing our hand..\n\nMaybe I am completely out of touch, but I don't understand the Anti-America sentiment that is floating around the middle east. Why do they hate us so much? Hate us so much that these people are willing to lay down their lives. I appreciate someone believing in something so strongly that they are willing to sacrifice themselves, but I don't know what their grief is. These extremist measures that these people are taking don't solve anything because it doesn't explain to us what their beef is.\n\nTo the terrorists, I ask:\n\nLets look at this realistically.. What has been solved today? Oh yeah.. You sure showed us... (?!?) What was the point? Why did thousands of people have to die? what were you trying to prove? That you could do it? Again I have to believe that there was SOME message or purpose there.. To destroy something just for the sake of destruction is stupid. It makes no sense at all.. And lastly, proves nothing.\n\nThis just isn't the way to get things solved. Now, it gets worse. By doing this it forces America to retaliate. America has always reacted very strongly to terrorist attacks and this will not be an exception to that rule. Thousands of innocent people died into days rash act of senseless violence.. And I promise you.. More will die before this ends.. And both sides are going to be very bloody..\n\nMaybe it's time we end it for good.. We have been told that we act like the police of the world. If the rest of the world didn't act like spoiled little children we probably wouldn't have too.. but that's fine.. You call us the police of the world, well maybe it's time we act like it.. I'm not talking occupation.. I'm not talking police actions.. You want war? Fine. We can simply treat you like any other spoiled child who is misbehaving.. I think it's time we paddle the middle east, once and for all. You have misbehaved for the final time here.. We aren't going to send you to your room without supper either.. It's time for a serious spanking..\n\nThis kind of shit will not be tolerated on American soil.. You made a mistake today.. You made a mistake in thinking that we wouldn't fight back.. You have made a very grave error.. Fear not, I know the American people, being the tough bunch that they are, can live with what you have wrought.. I also know, you will not..\n","collection":"posts","url":"/our-generations-pearl-harbor/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2001-10-25-being-called-a-racist.md","collection":"posts","url":"/being-called-a-racist/","path":"_posts/2001-10-25-being-called-a-racist.md","id":"/being-called-a-racist","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Being called a racist...","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2001-10-25 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"being-called-a-racist","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2001-09-11-our-generations-pearl-harbor.md","excerpt":"What has been solved today?

A group of people that I respect and hold in high regard told me in no uncertain terms that I wasn't good enough to be one of them. And that hurt.\n\nRacism is a terrible thing. I have never practiced it nor will I tolerate it in my presence. The common thread in America is that racism is only something that white people do. Only white people can be racist.. A black man or a Hispanic man can't be racist because they are the victims. The white man keeping the minority down.. What a complete bunch of bullshit. Racism is a two way road and both sides are guilty. Both sides are victims. Experiences like the one I had today only propagate and prolong this evil.\n\nI have wanted to be a police officer for a long time. Something I have always wanted to do and I finally had the courage to step forward and sign up. I went through the entire process.. I did their physical test and their evil questionnaires. I filled out their background history check and took a polygraph.. It took 2 months to get that far.. The only thing I had left to do was to take \"the board\"..\n\n__The Board__\n\nFrankly, I was nervous. I have taken boards before in the military though so I didn't think it was going to be too bad. And had they stuck with standardized questions that test your knowledge I am sure I would have done fine. This board however was different.. The questions were biased and contrived. They asked questions that NO ONE should have to answer in that fashion.. I, as well as someone else who had recently taken the board, am convinced that this board was put in place strictly to weed me out.\n\nThe board started out by the psychologist taking me into a room and explaining to me what was going on. Frankly, he was the nicest guy there. Seemed a straight up sort of joe. He had me sign some paper work and then after a minute or two's wait, summoned me into the board room.\n\nThere were 6 people and myself in the room. Two black male detectives, one Hispanic detective, one Hispanic female sergeant, one white lieutenant, and the psychologist. I only mention their ethnicity because it comes into play. Normally, I wouldn't and couldn't care less what your race/creed/color/gender/sexual orientation/etc.. is. I just don't care.. I was in the Army for a long time and in the Army, everyone is green. Its what we are taught..\n\nThe questions started out rather routine.. Why are you here.. Why do you want to do this.. Do you know what you're getting yourself into.. etc.. Fairly benign questions that just gave them an idea of who I was.\n\nAt some point in the meeting the line of questioning switched from an \"interview\" by a board, to an interrogation by this group of angry cops. Whether this was part of the board or this was intentional, I don't know. Suddenly the line of questioning switched from the standard \"why are you here..\" line, to a much more open an difficult to answer line. Frankly, in my mind.. Questions that don't have a correct answer. Here are some direct quoted questions not in any order...\n\nQuestion Example: \"Explain the difference between a black family, and a Hispanic family..\" ... \" How would you treat them differently.. \"\n\nThey had to clarify this to me several times.. To me, people are people.. I don't care if you are black, white, or orange.. I am going to treat you the same way I treat everyone else.. I'm going to give you the same respect I give my father.. That is how I was raised..\n\nThey didn't believe me.. They asked me what the difference was over and over again.. and in the end.. I didn't have an answer.. Sure, music.. language.. color.. hair style's.. etc.. there are a myriad of differences.. but none of these little things should make one iota's difference when you are dealing with them on a professional level. Clearly I am wrong here in their mind.. This by the way is called \"racial profiling\".. Which is illegal in Texas. Austin police officers, as recently as two months ago, were fired for doing this VERY THING.. Yet I was judged inadequate and given poor marks because I wasn't able to be racist.\n\nOne of them actually said that .. and I quote.. \"I can't believe you see through such rose colored glasses...\" HE ACTUALLY USED THOSE WORDS!!\n\nQuestion Example: \"Do you know of any black holidays\" ... \"Why don't you know black holidays?!\"\n\nOne of the black male detectives by this time was getting belligerent.. He couldn't believe I didn't know any \"BLACK\" holidays.. First off.. I'm WHITE! Secondly, what religion are we talking about here? Christian, Catholic, Moslem, Wicken?! What the fuck is a BLACK holiday?! Do you know of any \"WHITE\" holidays?  (sorry that's racist.. apparently..)\n\nMore over, WHY is this pertinent? Why is it important that I know holidays of YOUR ethnicity? Do you know any Korean holidays? Koreans are a minority in Austin. Shouldn't it be just as important that I know information about them? I guess not.. I was judged and given poor marks on this because I didn't know any black holidays.. I can go on and on about this hypocrisy but I wont.. this pissed me off a lot.. This black detective was in my mind a racist bastard and embodies everything you do NOT want in a police officer.\n\nQuestion Example: \"Two places have been burglarized. A little old lady on fixed income has had her TV stolen and a frat house has had its TV stolen. How would you treat them differently?\"\n\nThey are both victims of a crime yes? They both have had their TV stolen yes? I believe in the eyes of the law they both are deserving of equal and fair processing and help. I want to get both of them their TV's back.. This isn't enough information by a long shot.. And of course I was wrong.. They actually scoffed at me on this.. The psychologist was nice enough to try to explain the real answer.. This by the way is the ONLY \"correct\" answer I was given in the course of this debacle.\n\nThe correct answer is; \"The little old lady on fixed income is more important because she has no social interaction with the outside world other than her TV.. where as the frat house is most likely just trying to get the insurance... Why couldn't you figure that out.. you're a smart guy that has his own business and knows how to sell things, how come you couldn't figure this simple thing out?\" - Note I put this in quotes because this is exactly what he said.\n\nWhat the fuck?! First off.. fuck you.. Secondly you didn't give me that information.. Your question gave ZERO details.. when I asked for more, you didn't give them to me.. The Hispanic sergeant actually said \"sorry that's all the information we are giving you..\" You're asking me to tell you what I would do based solely on this information.. And based solely on that information I answered your question.. Correctly, in the eyes of the law, I might add.. But no, you want me to gleam some fictitious scenario that I have no way of arriving at.. This question was completely and utter crap.. Yet it is another in a long line of questions that ultimately failed me.\n\nQuestion Example: \"You catch a person cheating on an exam in the academy.. What do you do?\"\n\nI told them that I would confront the person about the cheating.. I would bring it up that I thought that what they were doing was wrong and that they shouldn't do it again..\n\nAdditional: \"What?! You wouldn't turn them in? It says in the rule book that anyone caught cheating will be expelled and its your responsibility to turn them in.. why wouldn't you turn them in?\" .... \"What if they did it again?\"\n\nNo I wouldn't turn them in the first time.. They scoffed again.. They couldn't believe I wouldn't turn them in immediately.. I explained to them that, while in the military the people around you are your life line.. They are the ones that will be in the fox hole with you.. You don't fuck your buddy.. In the end he is screwing himself and yes may very well be hurting you too.. but again I need more information.. I'm not willing to just say yes or no..\n\nHe may not have been cheating.. any number of things could have been going on.. And if he IS cheating.. The only way I could have known that is if I looked up and .... was cheating as well.. Rethink your questions guys..\n\nIf he continues then, yes I will turn him in.. but no I'm not willing to rush out and ruin someone's career because they make a mistake or a bad choice one time.. They of course went off on me for saying this.. and started in on me about some outlandish examples of why I was wrong..\n\nI know that while I was in the army the standard operating procedure is, if someone needs help.. you help them.. And like it or not, if you catch them doing something wrong, you don't turn them in for it immediately, but rather you try to sort it out on a local level.. You escalate if they keep screwing up..\n\nFucking racist detective from the above questions, every playing the antagonist, told me that I was lying.. He said, \" Don't give me that bullshit.. I was in the military the same time you were and they don't train you to lie..\" Again he actually said that.. This guy didn't like me much.. and I must admit.. I didn't care for him either.. You're right you schmuck, no where in the UCMJ does it say \"Don't fuck your buddy\".. but its a rule anyway.. and if you were in the military you knew that.. unless of course you were \"blue falcon\".. Which would explain a lot about you..\n\nI can go on for days.. There were a LOT more questions and I don't think I answered any of them to their satisfaction.. All of them were very open ended questions that didn't have a \"right\" answer.. Everything was extremely subjective..\n\nUpon first entering the room they told me \"Be honest.. don't tell us what you think we want to hear..\" Which is exactly what I did.. I was polite all the time and never lost my cool.. But I know now that wasn't what the wanted me to do.. They wanted me to tell them the \"right answers\".. Not the honest ones..\n\nIn closing, most of the questions were race orientated.. The seemed to revolve around my lack of racial experience.. In my mind.. I have none.. I worked with people of EVERY nationality while in the military and since, and frankly their race never entered into it.. We didn't care.. we worked together and were friends.. went to bars.. hung out sometimes.. etc.. If they feel its so important that I have some kind of social sensitivity training then they should give that to me in the academy.. that's what training is for..\n\nIn the end, I refuse to judge a person based on their race.. but in turn was judged..\n\n__Addendum - post law enforcement opinion__\n\nPosted: Oct 13, 2006\n\nI was a police officer from Sept. 2002 to Feb. 22, 2006 at two different departments. I stand by my above answers. The APD guys were wrong in their methods and were clearly only interested in weeding me out of their program. In the end, I don't regret my answers or the experience, but I think a lot less of APD because of it.\n","collection":"posts","url":"/being-called-a-racist/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2001-10-25-being-called-a-racist.md","collection":"posts","url":"/being-called-a-racist/","path":"_posts/2001-10-25-being-called-a-racist.md","id":"/being-called-a-racist","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Being called a racist...","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2001-10-25 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"being-called-a-racist","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2003-01-02-i-hate-advertising.md","content":"Everywhere I turn..

Infact, ever since my girl friend moved in, I have pushed all financial responsibility off on to her. Hey it's what she does for a living, and she's pretty good at it. That aside, I can still tell you at any given point, what I can afford; infact, I'm willing to bet I could give you an accurate guess plus or minus a hundred dollars of exactly what I can afford at any time.\n\nI'm not talking about groceries or something, I'm talking about big stuff.. Like several hundred or several thousand dollar items. Big dollar items, trips, vehicles, guns..etc..\n\nWe recently put our Toyota MR2 Turbo up for sale on eBay. It's a good car, and we figured it would fetch ~$5k or so, our target price was $5,500. We listed the initial price of the vehicle at $5000, with that target in mind.\n\nThe final bid winner had managed to get it for $6k. Great, we thought. We made more than we wanted, and yet its still a good price as there are others on there (worse versions of the car) that go for more.\n\nTwo days later, which already told me something was up, I get a call from him saying that he can't pay for the car. Not only can he not afford the $6000 price that HE BID FOR, he couldn't even afford the OPENING BID of $5000.\n\n\"I talked to my bank and the most I could get was $4900\".\n\nWhy the hell did he bid on the car in the first place?!\n\nIf you can't afford something, then don't bid on it. I mean its okay to dream. There are lots of cool toys and things out there that I would love to own, but I know I couldn't possibly afford.. But I don't go bid on them just because I want them.. If I know I can't afford something, I'm not going to place my name in the hat as a possible buyer. All that does is screw up the entire auction system.\n\nHe initiated the conversation by saying \"We have a bit of a problem\"... A bit?! You, by bidding, signed a promissory agreement in good faith to pay the amount you bid. Now you're going back on that promise. Infact, you had no business making that promise in the first place. \"WE\" don't have a bit of a problem, YOU have a problem as you're financially a moron, and I have a problem with you bidding on things you can't afford.\n\nFirst of all, this tells me that you didn't even think about this you mindless simpleton. You should know based on your income alone, how much you can afford. I mean if you can't foot half the bill out of pocket why did you bid at all? The car is a 13 year old vehicle and you expected a bank to give you 100% of the loan?! Why on Earth would they do that? Have you no idea how money works at all?\n\nSecondly, because of the way eBay works, I was charged to list the vehicle in the first place. So not only are you not paying me the money that you promised to pay, but you just cost me money and wasted my time. Not only do you have so much debt that $6k is evidently way out of reach for you, but you also managed to cost me $50.\n\nI may not be a financial wiz, but clearly some people are much much worse...\n\nThe winning bidder, who's email address and phone number I have so nicely left off of here, has promised to pay the $50 listing fee. Now, the question is, should I leave negative feedback on him via eBays feedback system or should I let this one slide.\n\nMy thoughts on the matter are that I should not only leave the negative feedback, but report him to eBay. To me this is an abuse of the system. He bid an amount that he knew he didn't have. He didn't have the opening bid amount, and couldn't even get financed for the opening bid amount, not even mentioning the final bid amount that he won.\n\nPersonally, I feel it is my duty as a seller on eBay to report this guy, this way it might save someone else from the hassle.\n","collection":"posts","url":"/ebay-bidding/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2004-01-02-ebay-bidding.md","collection":"posts","url":"/ebay-bidding/","path":"_posts/2004-01-02-ebay-bidding.md","id":"/ebay-bidding","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Ebay Bidding...","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2004-01-02 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"ebay-bidding","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2004-01-02-t-mobiles-stellar-service.md","content":"I have a Sony Ericson p910a cell phone/pda. It rules.\n\nIt can do full internet among other things.. but I noticed I wasn't getting full internet through my service provider, T-Mobile.. I had \"Unlimited T-Zones\" from them which is an added $4.99 a month which they SAY will give you full internet (or it used to).. Well suddenly I'm not getting internet access but I can get WAP access..\n\nSo I call them.\n\nShe explains to me that I need the T-Mobile Internet option that is an additional $19 a month. It gives me T-Zones and Internet. So, so much for unlimited t-zones that used to give me the internet.. Gotta love them changing shit without telling me..\n\nBut that isn't what bothers me..\n\nWhat bothers me is that the chick that I was talking to flat out lied to me about activation times, and the reason the way they are.\n\nIn order to get the T-Mobile Internet, she has to flip some switches and it takes 2-48 hours for them to \"propagate\".. But since T-Mobile Internet has T-Zones included, I can drop the Unlimited T-Zones service. So I do.\n\nIt dropped absolutely INSTANTLY. I was on the phone with her, and when she said, \"Okay I'll do that now, it can take 2-48 hours to stop working\" I clicked refresh in the phone browser and was given an access denied prompt.\n\nI explained to her that it suddenly stopped working, and she said \"oh well I guess it can happen quicker, and it was only a chance that it could take 2-48 hours\".. So either she lied to me about the amount of time it takes to disconnect, or she simply didn't know and was making it up.\n\nSo, you can disconnect me instantly, but it takes 48 hours to connect me? Why?\n\n\"Well it has to propagate a bunch of information to your phone\"\n\nBut it disconnected instantly, isn't it a matter of flipping a bit and it connects the other one instantly?\n\n\"No it has to propagate.\"\n\nWhat's that mean? What does it have to do? It stands to reason that if you can instantly disconnect, then you can instantly connect.\n\n\"It has to update your account to reflect the changes and it has to send information to your phone.\"\n\nBut you just updated my account to discontinue T-Zones and it was instant, why does connecting take 48 hours?\n\n\"Cause it has to propagate...\"\n\n{ You keep using that word, I don't think it means what you think it means.. }\n\n\"Put simply, it has to send information to your phone so it knows to use the Internet\"\n\nSo, T-Mobile is pushing information to my phone? My phone already knows how to use the internet, it was doing it. It's a pretty high tech device I got here. And when she said \"put simply\" that pissed me off.. she was talking down to me the whole damn conversation. I was asking very straight forward questions that she didn't have an answer for.\n\n\"Yes your phone has to be updated by the server to make this T-Mobile Internet work.\"\n\nThat's a complete fabrication.\n\nI just said whatever and hung up.. So now I have no internet on my remote device while their system does some magical shit to connect me that she could have done right there..\n\nIt irritates me.. and frankly this is amazingly poor customer service..\n\nT-Mobile used to be a damn good mobile carrier, but their service is starting to suck. Their customer service people lie, are generally rude, and talk down to you.\n\nTheir phone service is starting to suffer lately too. My new home site gets full bars Verizon and Cingular, but nothing from T-Mobile.. (My phone can ping all towers in the area and tell me the signal strength..)\n\nOkay at this point I was sufficiently pissed enough about this (especially after reliving it as I wrote it down) that I called back..\n\nI got another lady who was very nice and actually admitted to me that she just didn't know and that she probably received the same training that the first girl got..\n\nShe put me on hold and went and talked to someone over in the \"PDA queue\" about this problem .\n\nShe came back and said that the expert that she talked to, who was an expert on my phone, said that the GPRS connection is instant.. But the other services and features have to be turned on by the \"webmaster\"..\n\nSo in order to get email it has to be setup.\n\nI explain to her that I had email working just fine. I was able to read my emails through the GPRS system which has now been turned off to me, and all of these connections are through GPRS whether to WAP or to WEB.. She gave me the phone equivalent of a blank stare and put me back on hold.\n\nI swear these tech support people are the virtual deer in headlights of technology..\n\nSO then I get a third woman, who was an escalation of the first two I suppose.. She (a very butch sounding \"She\" btw) told me that the engineers handle all this stuff and that the reason it takes so long to get something implemented was because of the way billing works.. It has to go through the billing account system and that system delays any feature you added.\n\nExample you HAVE T-Zones, you remove T-zones.. it will be instant. You add it back, and boom..48 hours. She called these provisional delays.. It basically takes into account that everything is added in queue order.. so anyone who asked for a thing before you gets it before you..\n\nMy main point of contention is, if you have me on the fuckin phone.. do it right then..\n\nWhat's funny is that this chick actually admitted to me that at one time it the T-Zones system worked just fine for web browsing but they \"fixed\" that. And they angered and lost a lot of customers due to that fix.\n\nThis third person while nice and knowledgeable wasn't able to help me either.. She went through every setting in my phone..\n\nEverything was \"Correct\", shockingly.\n\nSo, she shucked me off to the advanced PDA group in England who know more about \"fancy foreign phones\". Back on hold .. yeah..\n\nAt this point, I have been on the phone for over an hour and have to pee so bad I am floating.. I have a co-worker come over and sit on hold while I go throw a line..\n\n20 minutes later I get someone else.. Not in England, but rather Seattle.. Not even close..\n\nAnother woman. She didn't know a thing about my phone, and had to go look it up.\n\nWe went through the exact same routine the previous person did.. checked all my settings and had me reboot the phone and try again.. (\"Did ya try rebooting?\")\n\nThis woman basically told me that everyone I talked to previously were idiots. She said that any phone that has full HTML browser used to be able to get full access with the T-ZONEs.. so they \"fixed that\".. Information I already had..\n\n\"Having a smart phone with full HTML wasn't something they planned for.. and since it was just changed we can set it up and we wont know if its working.. \"\n\nLong story short, they can't help me.. Nothing she did made a damn bit of difference. She said though that even though it can show up as provisioned (enabled), it may not be actually working.. Nice.. Cause, it aint..\n\nIn the end they TRIED to help but either their knowledge was lacking, or the system they are working with is so technical it borders on magic..\n\nOh and another interesting note, ONLY port 80 is blocked on WAP. Everything else works fine. So basically, you pay an extra $15 a month to have that port opened .. What a fucking scam.\n\nI'll give them 48 hours. Then I call another carrier.\n","collection":"posts","url":"/t-mobiles-stellar-service/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2004-12-21-sky-diving.md","collection":"posts","url":"/sky-diving/","path":"_posts/2004-12-21-sky-diving.md","id":"/sky-diving","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Sky Diving","layout":"post","tags":["Experience"],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2004-12-21 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"sky-diving","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2004-01-02-t-mobiles-stellar-service.md","excerpt":"T-Mobile used to be a damn good mobile carrier, but their service is starting to suck.
