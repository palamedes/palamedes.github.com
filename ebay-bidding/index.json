I got to jump out of an airplane at 14,000 ft.\n\nMost people that do that sort of thing go tandem. Meaning they harness themselves to the front of some expert before they jump out of a plane so that all they have to do is enjoy the ride. It's a lot of fun that way because all you have to do is fall.\n\nI on the other hand, am a bit too big to go tandem so I had to leave the plane on my own. I took a 5-hour class (that lasted for 8 hours) that taught the finer points of falling out of an airplane. They go over how you fall and how everything works so you can function on the way out. They teach you how to land and how to react once out of the plane. They also go over emergency procedures and what to do if something isn't working correctly. You are all alone out there when you do the accelerated free fall class and it was important to really get this stuff. I went over it and over it and over it..\n\nI must say that I am amazed that I had the presence of mind to actually do that stuff upon exiting the plane. The sensory overload is beyond compare. You leave the airplane and enter a world that is just indescribable. The world is rushing up at you at 160 miles an hour. The wind is deafening. The view is spectacular. The drop zone suddenly seems very, very small. Something that was very large while standing there was suddenly the size of a postage stamp, and the spot you were supposed to hit was the size of an \"o\". Literally, it was about the size of that o.\n\nIt was great fun! I was in complete awe with the whole experience.\n\nThe day started for me at 5:30 am. I had to wake up early because the skydiving place was about an hour away and we needed to be there before 8:00 am. I got up, showered, and got ready to go. I wasn't nervous at all, and was a bit excited. Normally getting up at 5:30 in the morning was just out of the question, but not this day. No sir, I hopped out of bed.\n\nI drove to my friend, Pat's house and picked him up. Soon, we were off. We headed to the drop-zone and only stopped for about 20 minutes to pick up some food. Once we got there we started to fill out a bunch of paperwork, the basic, \"Our lawyer is bigger than your lawyer\" stuff. Once everyone was there we all went into a classroom and began the lessons.\n\nI won't bore you with the detail's here but the class wasn't as good as it should have been. They really should have drilled things in more than they did. At one point in the class I was quite confused and was getting nervous because of my confusion. Eventually I got it all and knew what I had to do. I wasn't \"comfortable\" with everything because we only went over it for 5 hours, but I figured I got it. Looking back on it, that 5 hour course should have been stretched out over several days. (but then they do call it Accelerated free fall. It's accelerated alright.. sheesh)\n\nThe winds were blowing hard that day. The gusts were up to 28 miles an hour, holding around 22. They put us on hold for quite a while. Eventually we got to go up, I think they just gave up on waiting because they wanted to get us out of an airplane before we forgot everything. Again looking back on this, they should have waited.\n\nEventually I got suited up and get my chute on and was ready to go. The only thing left was the ride up to 14,000. They loaded the \"twin otter\" up with people, two AFF students (Pat and I) and our main and reserve jump masters. Two tandem jumpers and their jumpmasters and two cameramen for the tandem jumpers, plus a couple veteran jumpers; So about 15 people and all. At 10,000ft they opened the door and out the Tandem people went. Once they were out they closed the door and up the plane headed for 14k.\n\nNow I was super surprised at how calm I was. I totally wasn't scared. I figured I would be terrified, but I wasn't. I was just going over all the things I had to do once I got out of the plane. The only time I was \"hesitant\" and that's not to say I was afraid either, I just was taken aback a little, a moment of pause if you will; was when they cranked that door back open at 14,000 feet. It was a little chilly. When that cold hit me, I was like.. \"Yeeesh.. what am I doing?\" But that feeling went away as soon as it came, and I was ready to go.\n\nI got up in the doorway with the two jumpmasters that were going to go out the door with me and looked out at the world, really, really far below. I yelled to my left JM,\n\n\"Ready left?\" I yelled to my left Jumpmaster\n\nHe yelled back, \"Okay!\"\n\n\"Ready right?\" I said to the other.\n\n\"Okay!\", He said with a big smile.\n\nAt which point my brain said.. \"uh.. excuse me.. what are you about to do?\" Muhahahaha too late brain, because, with a 1,2,3.. we're already out the door!\n\nI didn't arch enough when I went out the door and we did a gentle tumble over backwards to look at the plane flying away. Now at the time I thought my jumpmasters did this on purpose because it was a very cool site. But in reality it was because I wasn't arched enough. My left JM gave me the arch sign and I arched as hard as I could and we were good to go from then on.\n\nIt took me maybe two or three seconds to un-overload my brain and remember that I had stuff to do. I can see why many people freak out at this point, the sensory overload comes at you fast and hard, and there is NO getting around it. It is a completely foreign environment and the ground is coming up fast.\n\nOnce I got my brain back on track, I did my heading and what they called the circle of awareness. I looked around and realized where we were and that everything was okay. I checked my altimeter and yelled it out to my left JM. He gave me a thumbs up. I yelled it out to my right JM and he gave me the same. (Come to find out they were both shocked that they actually heard me. Falling at 160 miles an hour makes a lot of noise, as a general rule you don't hear anything but the scream of the passing wind.) I then did three practice touches to my pull-chute to make sure I could actually find it when the time came. Then once that was don I checked altimeter again and yelled it out. Then I had about 5 seconds to enjoy the view before it was time to wave off and pull my chute. At 6,400 ft things went a little wrong but nothing big.\n\nAt 6,000 ft you are supposed to lock on to your altimeter and then \"wave off\" at 5,500ft. at which point you pull your chute. I went to do this and waved my hands just in time to whack my right jumpmaster in the hand. He was about to give me the \"pull chute\" sign when I hit him. Normally you don't wave off until 5,500 feet and pull sometime there after before you hit 4,500 ft. But we were FAR away from the dropzone because of both wind and that we were the last ones to leave the plane, he wanted me to pull sooner so I could get all the way back to the dropzone. No biggie really. It scared me when I hit him because at that point I noticed that the two jumpmasters were having a conversation over my back (using eye and hand gestures). They both agreed that we needed to pull a little sooner or we would have a long walk ahead of us. When I whacked my right JM, he jerked away from me so as to get out of the way. Well this scared me because of the look on his face and I thought I had done something wrong. I of course hadn't but at the time I was worried I had. I didn't know what he wanted me to do and so I just decided, \"when in doubt, pull it out.\" I reached to pull my chute. At which point I accidentally grabbed my JM's altimeter instead of the pullchute.. hehe whoops.. But I got the chute out and about 3 seconds later I was under a lovely canopy.\n\nThat's when everything slowed down to a speed that was much easier to process. I made sure the canopy was good and released my toggles. (The things you use to steer the chute with) I steered around for a while and did a lot of S-turns. I knew that my JM's had misjudged and that I was going to over shoot the DropZone by quite a bit, so I S-turned like a mad dog to try to cut some of my altitude down while not losing ground. The wind was blowing at 25 miles an hour though so I knew I was going to miss the DZ by a bit.\n\nAt 500 ft, I was RIGHT over the runway. And the PLANE LANDED UNDER ME!!! That was kind cool. I turned back and forth a bit more and then settled in on a landing zone. (The whole world is a landing zone by the way).. The landing was what I feared the most. I thought it was going to be bad. It wasn't though. I was a bit canted so I didn't land standing up. I was going to try to but I figured instead of risking in I would just do a PLF and be done with it. (Parachute Landing Fall.. basically you fall down instead of trying to land on your feet) It was nice and gentle. I got up and had a big smile on my face. I was about half a mile away from the LZ. Pat, the guy that went with me, landed about 3 miles away.. hehe\n\nI walked back in and we talked about it. My jumpmasters said I did an excellent job and that I could come back any time to fly with them. That made me feel good. They also told me that they were shocked that they actually heard me because that just doesn't happen. My voice was quite hoarse the next day.\n\nI don't think I had as much fun as those that went tandem because I was too busy thinking about all the stuff I had to do to not die. Where as the tandem flyer is just along for the ride and can have fun.\n\nI also think that no matter what you should have to do a tandem jump first. I think that those that do tandem first will have the experience necessary to NOT freak out on the way out the door.\n\nIt was an interesting first trip and I plan to go again this weekend. I don't think I am \"hooked\" but I did enjoy it.\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2004-01-02-t-mobiles-stellar-service.md","url":"/t-mobiles-stellar-service/","relative_path":"_posts/2004-01-02-t-mobiles-stellar-service.md","id":"/t-mobiles-stellar-service","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"T-Mobile's Stellar Service","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2004-01-02 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"t-mobiles-stellar-service","ext":".md"},"url":"/sky-diving/","relative_path":"_posts/2004-12-21-sky-diving.md","id":"/sky-diving","collection":"posts","excerpt":"I got to do something that was literally above and beyond the range of the word cool.

It rules.\n\nIt can do full internet among other things.. but I noticed I wasn't getting full internet through my service provider, T-Mobile.. I had \"Unlimited T-Zones\" from them which is an added $4.99 a month which they SAY will give you full internet (or it used to).. Well suddenly I'm not getting internet access but I can get WAP access..\n\nSo I call them.\n\nShe explains to me that I need the T-Mobile Internet option that is an additional $19 a month. It gives me T-Zones and Internet. So, so much for unlimited t-zones that used to give me the internet.. Gotta love them changing shit without telling me..\n\nBut that isn't what bothers me..\n\nWhat bothers me is that the chick that I was talking to flat out lied to me about activation times, and the reason the way they are.\n\nIn order to get the T-Mobile Internet, she has to flip some switches and it takes 2-48 hours for them to \"propagate\".. But since T-Mobile Internet has T-Zones included, I can drop the Unlimited T-Zones service. So I do.\n\nIt dropped absolutely INSTANTLY. I was on the phone with her, and when she said, \"Okay I'll do that now, it can take 2-48 hours to stop working\" I clicked refresh in the phone browser and was given an access denied prompt.\n\nI explained to her that it suddenly stopped working, and she said \"oh well I guess it can happen quicker, and it was only a chance that it could take 2-48 hours\".. So either she lied to me about the amount of time it takes to disconnect, or she simply didn't know and was making it up.\n\nSo, you can disconnect me instantly, but it takes 48 hours to connect me? Why?\n\n\"Well it has to propagate a bunch of information to your phone\"\n\nBut it disconnected instantly, isn't it a matter of flipping a bit and it connects the other one instantly?\n\n\"No it has to propagate.\"\n\nWhat's that mean? What does it have to do? It stands to reason that if you can instantly disconnect, then you can instantly connect.\n\n\"It has to update your account to reflect the changes and it has to send information to your phone.\"\n\nBut you just updated my account to discontinue T-Zones and it was instant, why does connecting take 48 hours?\n\n\"Cause it has to propagate...\"\n\n{ You keep using that word, I don't think it means what you think it means.. }\n\n\"Put simply, it has to send information to your phone so it knows to use the Internet\"\n\nSo, T-Mobile is pushing information to my phone? My phone already knows how to use the internet, it was doing it. It's a pretty high tech device I got here. And when she said \"put simply\" that pissed me off.. she was talking down to me the whole damn conversation. I was asking very straight forward questions that she didn't have an answer for.\n\n\"Yes your phone has to be updated by the server to make this T-Mobile Internet work.\"\n\nThat's a complete fabrication.\n\nI just said whatever and hung up.. So now I have no internet on my remote device while their system does some magical shit to connect me that she could have done right there..\n\nIt irritates me.. and frankly this is amazingly poor customer service..\n\nT-Mobile used to be a damn good mobile carrier, but their service is starting to suck. Their customer service people lie, are generally rude, and talk down to you.\n\nTheir phone service is starting to suffer lately too. My new home site gets full bars Verizon and Cingular, but nothing from T-Mobile.. (My phone can ping all towers in the area and tell me the signal strength..)\n\nOkay at this point I was sufficiently pissed enough about this (especially after reliving it as I wrote it down) that I called back..\n\nI got another lady who was very nice and actually admitted to me that she just didn't know and that she probably received the same training that the first girl got..\n\nShe put me on hold and went and talked to someone over in the \"PDA queue\" about this problem .\n\nShe came back and said that the expert that she talked to, who was an expert on my phone, said that the GPRS connection is instant.. But the other services and features have to be turned on by the \"webmaster\"..\n\nSo in order to get email it has to be setup.\n\nI explain to her that I had email working just fine. I was able to read my emails through the GPRS system which has now been turned off to me, and all of these connections are through GPRS whether to WAP or to WEB.. She gave me the phone equivalent of a blank stare and put me back on hold.\n\nI swear these tech support people are the virtual deer in headlights of technology..\n\nSO then I get a third woman, who was an escalation of the first two I suppose.. She (a very butch sounding \"She\" btw) told me that the engineers handle all this stuff and that the reason it takes so long to get something implemented was because of the way billing works.. It has to go through the billing account system and that system delays any feature you added.\n\nExample you HAVE T-Zones, you remove T-zones.. it will be instant. You add it back, and boom..48 hours. She called these provisional delays.. It basically takes into account that everything is added in queue order.. so anyone who asked for a thing before you gets it before you..\n\nMy main point of contention is, if you have me on the fuckin phone.. do it right then..\n\nWhat's funny is that this chick actually admitted to me that at one time it the T-Zones system worked just fine for web browsing but they \"fixed\" that. And they angered and lost a lot of customers due to that fix.\n\nThis third person while nice and knowledgeable wasn't able to help me either.. She went through every setting in my phone..\n\nEverything was \"Correct\", shockingly.\n\nSo, she shucked me off to the advanced PDA group in England who know more about \"fancy foreign phones\". Back on hold .. yeah..\n\nAt this point, I have been on the phone for over an hour and have to pee so bad I am floating.. I have a co-worker come over and sit on hold while I go throw a line..\n\n20 minutes later I get someone else.. Not in England, but rather Seattle.. Not even close..\n\nAnother woman. She didn't know a thing about my phone, and had to go look it up.\n\nWe went through the exact same routine the previous person did.. checked all my settings and had me reboot the phone and try again.. (\"Did ya try rebooting?\")\n\nThis woman basically told me that everyone I talked to previously were idiots. She said that any phone that has full HTML browser used to be able to get full access with the T-ZONEs.. so they \"fixed that\".. Information I already had..\n\n\"Having a smart phone with full HTML wasn't something they planned for.. and since it was just changed we can set it up and we wont know if its working.. \"\n\nLong story short, they can't help me.. Nothing she did made a damn bit of difference. She said though that even though it can show up as provisioned (enabled), it may not be actually working.. Nice.. Cause, it aint..\n\nIn the end they TRIED to help but either their knowledge was lacking, or the system they are working with is so technical it borders on magic..\n\nOh and another interesting note, ONLY port 80 is blocked on WAP. Everything else works fine. So basically, you pay an extra $15 a month to have that port opened .. What a fucking scam.\n\nI'll give them 48 hours. Then I call another carrier.\n","previous":{"next":{"path":"_posts/2004-01-02-t-mobiles-stellar-service.md","url":"/t-mobiles-stellar-service/","relative_path":"_posts/2004-01-02-t-mobiles-stellar-service.md","id":"/t-mobiles-stellar-service","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"T-Mobile's Stellar Service","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2004-01-02 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"t-mobiles-stellar-service","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2004-01-02-ebay-bidding.md","output":null,"content":"__if you don't have the cash, don't bid on the item__\n\nI am not financial wiz-kid here.

He didn't have the opening bid amount, and couldn't even get financed for the opening bid amount, not even mentioning the final bid amount that he won.\n\nPersonally, I feel it is my duty as a seller on eBay to report this guy, this way it might save someone else from the hassle.\n","previous":{"next":{"next":{"path":"_posts/2004-01-02-t-mobiles-stellar-service.md","url":"/t-mobiles-stellar-service/","relative_path":"_posts/2004-01-02-t-mobiles-stellar-service.md","id":"/t-mobiles-stellar-service","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"T-Mobile's Stellar Service","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2004-01-02 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"t-mobiles-stellar-service","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2004-01-02-ebay-bidding.md","output":null,"content":"__if you don't have the cash, don't bid on the item__\n\nI am not financial wiz-kid here. Infact, ever since my girl friend moved in, I have pushed all financial responsibility off on to her. Hey it's what she does for a living, and she's pretty good at it. That aside, I can still tell you at any given point, what I can afford; infact, I'm willing to bet I could give you an accurate guess plus or minus a hundred dollars of exactly what I can afford at any time.\n\nI'm not talking about groceries or something, I'm talking about big stuff.. Like several hundred or several thousand dollar items. Big dollar items, trips, vehicles, guns..etc..\n\nWe recently put our Toyota MR2 Turbo up for sale on eBay. It's a good car, and we figured it would fetch ~$5k or so, our target price was $5,500. We listed the initial price of the vehicle at $5000, with that target in mind.\n\nThe final bid winner had managed to get it for $6k. Great, we thought. We made more than we wanted, and yet its still a good price as there are others on there (worse versions of the car) that go for more.\n\nTwo days later, which already told me something was up, I get a call from him saying that he can't pay for the car. Not only can he not afford the $6000 price that HE BID FOR, he couldn't even afford the OPENING BID of $5000.\n\n\"I talked to my bank and the most I could get was $4900\".\n\nWhy the hell did he bid on the car in the first place?!\n\nIf you can't afford something, then don't bid on it. I mean its okay to dream. There are lots of cool toys and things out there that I would love to own, but I know I couldn't possibly afford.. But I don't go bid on them just because I want them.. If I know I can't afford something, I'm not going to place my name in the hat as a possible buyer. All that does is screw up the entire auction system.\n\nHe initiated the conversation by saying \"We have a bit of a problem\"... A bit?! You, by bidding, signed a promissory agreement in good faith to pay the amount you bid. Now you're going back on that promise. Infact, you had no business making that promise in the first place. \"WE\" don't have a bit of a problem, YOU have a problem as you're financially a moron, and I have a problem with you bidding on things you can't afford.\n\nFirst of all, this tells me that you didn't even think about this you mindless simpleton. You should know based on your income alone, how much you can afford. I mean if you can't foot half the bill out of pocket why did you bid at all? The car is a 13 year old vehicle and you expected a bank to give you 100% of the loan?! Why on Earth would they do that? Have you no idea how money works at all?\n\nSecondly, because of the way eBay works, I was charged to list the vehicle in the first place. So not only are you not paying me the money that you promised to pay, but you just cost me money and wasted my time. Not only do you have so much debt that $6k is evidently way out of reach for you, but you also managed to cost me $50.\n\nI may not be a financial wiz, but clearly some people are much much worse...\n\nThe winning bidder, who's email address and phone number I have so nicely left off of here, has promised to pay the $50 listing fee. Now, the question is, should I leave negative feedback on him via eBays feedback system or should I let this one slide.\n\nMy thoughts on the matter are that I should not only leave the negative feedback, but report him to eBay.

Advertising! It's everywhere! Right now, thanks to that damn \"sober\" virus out of Germany, I'm getting a crapload of German spam!\n\nI don't speak German. I will never speak German. Don't bother sending me German spam. There seriously needs to be a language filter with emails. If it isn't in my language, I don't want it.\n\nBack to advertising.. GOD it's everywhere. It's just about all I do with website creation any more, and I'm tired of it. But that's not the issue.\n\nThe radio is so cluttered with ads that you only get about 30 minutes of music in a 60 minute block. It used to be one commercial every once in a while, now they will string 6 and 7 of the damn things together to the point where FM is dead to me. I tried XM for a while but they have ads too, and it just wasn't worth the cost. But that's not the issue either.\n\nYou can't walk 10 feet anywhere with out seeing a billboard, or sign, or post-it with some ad on it. Bill boards are everywhere now a days. You can't drive a single mile without seeing those damn things littering the sky. I hate it.\n\nAdvertising companies, who weren't making enough money, figured out a way to put 3 ads on a single bill board. A rotating ad system that every couple of seconds shows a different advertisement; how novel. But that's not the issue either.\n\nThe new thing that is driving me insane is the advertisement trucks. These trucks drive around town serving NO PURPOSE other than to spam you with some bullshit advertisement. They are a complete eyesore! They have the rotating ads thing so there are three different ads on each panel, and every open space on the vehicle has an ad on it.\n\nGah! This is clearly going to cause a traffic fatality. If not someone getting into a wreck while looking at the annoying ass thing, then someone pulling out a gun and shooting the SOB that's driving it.\n","previous":{"next":{"path":"_posts/2003-01-02-i-hate-advertising.md","url":"/i-hate-advertising/","relative_path":"_posts/2003-01-02-i-hate-advertising.md","id":"/i-hate-advertising","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"I hate advertising...","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2003-01-02 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"i-hate-advertising","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2001-10-25-being-called-a-racist.md","output":null,"content":"Not in so many words mind you, but that is what this group of people were telling me.. A group of people that I respect and hold in high regard told me in no uncertain terms that I wasn't good enough to be one of them. And that hurt.\n\nRacism is a terrible thing. I have never practiced it nor will I tolerate it in my presence. The common thread in America is that racism is only something that white people do. Only white people can be racist.. A black man or a Hispanic man can't be racist because they are the victims. The white man keeping the minority down.. What a complete bunch of bullshit. Racism is a two way road and both sides are guilty. Both sides are victims. Experiences like the one I had today only propagate and prolong this evil.\n\nI have wanted to be a police officer for a long time. Something I have always wanted to do and I finally had the courage to step forward and sign up. I went through the entire process.. I did their physical test and their evil questionnaires. I filled out their background history check and took a polygraph.. It took 2 months to get that far.. The only thing I had left to do was to take \"the board\"..\n\n__The Board__\n\nFrankly, I was nervous. I have taken boards before in the military though so I didn't think it was going to be too bad. And had they stuck with standardized questions that test your knowledge I am sure I would have done fine. This board however was different.. The questions were biased and contrived. They asked questions that NO ONE should have to answer in that fashion.. I, as well as someone else who had recently taken the board, am convinced that this board was put in place strictly to weed me out.\n\nThe board started out by the psychologist taking me into a room and explaining to me what was going on. Frankly, he was the nicest guy there. Seemed a straight up sort of joe. He had me sign some paper work and then after a minute or two's wait, summoned me into the board room.\n\nThere were 6 people and myself in the room. Two black male detectives, one Hispanic detective, one Hispanic female sergeant, one white lieutenant, and the psychologist. I only mention their ethnicity because it comes into play. Normally, I wouldn't and couldn't care less what your race/creed/color/gender/sexual orientation/etc.. is. I just don't care.. I was in the Army for a long time and in the Army, everyone is green. Its what we are taught..\n\nThe questions started out rather routine.. Why are you here.. Why do you want to do this.. Do you know what you're getting yourself into.. etc.. Fairly benign questions that just gave them an idea of who I was.\n\nAt some point in the meeting the line of questioning switched from an \"interview\" by a board, to an interrogation by this group of angry cops. Whether this was part of the board or this was intentional, I don't know. Suddenly the line of questioning switched from the standard \"why are you here..\" line, to a much more open an difficult to answer line. Frankly, in my mind.. Questions that don't have a correct answer. Here are some direct quoted questions not in any order...\n\nQuestion Example: \"Explain the difference between a black family, and a Hispanic family..\" ... \" How would you treat them differently.. \"\n\nThey had to clarify this to me several times.. To me, people are people.. I don't care if you are black, white, or orange.. I am going to treat you the same way I treat everyone else.. I'm going to give you the same respect I give my father.. That is how I was raised..\n\nThey didn't believe me.. They asked me what the difference was over and over again.. and in the end.. I didn't have an answer.. Sure, music.. language.. color.. hair style's.. etc.. there are a myriad of differences.. but none of these little things should make one iota's difference when you are dealing with them on a professional level. Clearly I am wrong here in their mind.. This by the way is called \"racial profiling\".. Which is illegal in Texas. Austin police officers, as recently as two months ago, were fired for doing this VERY THING.. Yet I was judged inadequate and given poor marks because I wasn't able to be racist.\n\nOne of them actually said that .. and I quote.. \"I can't believe you see through such rose colored glasses...\" HE ACTUALLY USED THOSE WORDS!!\n\nQuestion Example: \"Do you know of any black holidays\" ... \"Why don't you know black holidays?!\"\n\nOne of the black male detectives by this time was getting belligerent.. He couldn't believe I didn't know any \"BLACK\" holidays.. First off.. I'm WHITE! Secondly, what religion are we talking about here? Christian, Catholic, Moslem, Wicken?! What the fuck is a BLACK holiday?! Do you know of any \"WHITE\" holidays?  (sorry that's racist.. apparently..)\n\nMore over, WHY is this pertinent? Why is it important that I know holidays of YOUR ethnicity? Do you know any Korean holidays? Koreans are a minority in Austin. Shouldn't it be just as important that I know information about them? I guess not.. I was judged and given poor marks on this because I didn't know any black holidays.. I can go on and on about this hypocrisy but I wont.. this pissed me off a lot.. This black detective was in my mind a racist bastard and embodies everything you do NOT want in a police officer.\n\nQuestion Example: \"Two places have been burglarized. A little old lady on fixed income has had her TV stolen and a frat house has had its TV stolen. How would you treat them differently?\"\n\nThey are both victims of a crime yes? They both have had their TV stolen yes? I believe in the eyes of the law they both are deserving of equal and fair processing and help. I want to get both of them their TV's back.. This isn't enough information by a long shot.. And of course I was wrong.. They actually scoffed at me on this.. The psychologist was nice enough to try to explain the real answer.. This by the way is the ONLY \"correct\" answer I was given in the course of this debacle.\n\nThe correct answer is; \"The little old lady on fixed income is more important because she has no social interaction with the outside world other than her TV.. where as the frat house is most likely just trying to get the insurance... Why couldn't you figure that out.. you're a smart guy that has his own business and knows how to sell things, how come you couldn't figure this simple thing out?\" - Note I put this in quotes because this is exactly what he said.\n\nWhat the fuck?! First off.. fuck you.. Secondly you didn't give me that information.. Your question gave ZERO details.. when I asked for more, you didn't give them to me.. The Hispanic sergeant actually said \"sorry that's all the information we are giving you..\" You're asking me to tell you what I would do based solely on this information.. And based solely on that information I answered your question.. Correctly, in the eyes of the law, I might add.. But no, you want me to gleam some fictitious scenario that I have no way of arriving at.. This question was completely and utter crap.. Yet it is another in a long line of questions that ultimately failed me.\n\nQuestion Example: \"You catch a person cheating on an exam in the academy.. What do you do?\"\n\nI told them that I would confront the person about the cheating.. I would bring it up that I thought that what they were doing was wrong and that they shouldn't do it again..\n\nAdditional: \"What?! You wouldn't turn them in? It says in the rule book that anyone caught cheating will be expelled and its your responsibility to turn them in.. why wouldn't you turn them in?\" .... \"What if they did it again?\"\n\nNo I wouldn't turn them in the first time.. They scoffed again.. They couldn't believe I wouldn't turn them in immediately.. I explained to them that, while in the military the people around you are your life line.. They are the ones that will be in the fox hole with you.. You don't fuck your buddy.. In the end he is screwing himself and yes may very well be hurting you too.. but again I need more information.. I'm not willing to just say yes or no..\n\nHe may not have been cheating.. any number of things could have been going on.. And if he IS cheating.. The only way I could have known that is if I looked up and .... was cheating as well.. Rethink your questions guys..\n\nIf he continues then, yes I will turn him in.. but no I'm not willing to rush out and ruin someone's career because they make a mistake or a bad choice one time.. They of course went off on me for saying this.. and started in on me about some outlandish examples of why I was wrong..\n\nI know that while I was in the army the standard operating procedure is, if someone needs help.. you help them.. And like it or not, if you catch them doing something wrong, you don't turn them in for it immediately, but rather you try to sort it out on a local level.. You escalate if they keep screwing up..\n\nFucking racist detective from the above questions, every playing the antagonist, told me that I was lying.. He said, \" Don't give me that bullshit.. I was in the military the same time you were and they don't train you to lie..\" Again he actually said that.. This guy didn't like me much.. and I must admit.. I didn't care for him either.. You're right you schmuck, no where in the UCMJ does it say \"Don't fuck your buddy\".. but its a rule anyway.. and if you were in the military you knew that.. unless of course you were \"blue falcon\".. Which would explain a lot about you..\n\nI can go on for days.. There were a LOT more questions and I don't think I answered any of them to their satisfaction.. All of them were very open ended questions that didn't have a \"right\" answer.. Everything was extremely subjective..\n\nUpon first entering the room they told me \"Be honest.. don't tell us what you think we want to hear..\" Which is exactly what I did.. I was polite all the time and never lost my cool.. But I know now that wasn't what the wanted me to do.. They wanted me to tell them the \"right answers\".. Not the honest ones..\n\nIn closing, most of the questions were race orientated.. The seemed to revolve around my lack of racial experience.. In my mind.. I have none.. I worked with people of EVERY nationality while in the military and since, and frankly their race never entered into it.. We didn't care.. we worked together and were friends.. went to bars.. hung out sometimes.. etc.. If they feel its so important that I have some kind of social sensitivity training then they should give that to me in the academy.. that's what training is for..\n\nIn the end, I refuse to judge a person based on their race.. but in turn was judged..\n\n__Addendum - post law enforcement opinion__\n\nPosted: Oct 13, 2006\n\nI was a police officer from Sept. 2002 to Feb. 22, 2006 at two different departments. I stand by my above answers. The APD guys were wrong in their methods and were clearly only interested in weeding me out of their program. In the end, I don't regret my answers or the experience, but I think a lot less of APD because of it.\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2001-09-11-our-generations-pearl-harbor.md","url":"/our-generations-pearl-harbor/","relative_path":"_posts/2001-09-11-our-generations-pearl-harbor.md","id":"/our-generations-pearl-harbor","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Our generations Pearl Harbor?","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2001-09-11 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"our-generations-pearl-harbor","ext":".md"},"url":"/being-called-a-racist/","relative_path":"_posts/2001-10-25-being-called-a-racist.md","id":"/being-called-a-racist","collection":"posts","excerpt":"I refused to judge a person based on their race.. but in turn was judged and called a racist.","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Being called a racist...","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2001-10-25 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"being-called-a-racist","ext":".md"},"url":"/i-hate-advertising/","relative_path":"_posts/2003-01-02-i-hate-advertising.md","id":"/i-hate-advertising","collection":"posts","excerpt":"Everywhere I turn..
