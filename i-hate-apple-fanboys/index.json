Any MMO to date that one cares to name changes drastically as you play across the level range and to judge that game by the first couple levels is simply foolish.  You haven't experienced the whole of the game.. So I'm going to post my review about it, but I want you to keep in mind that there are going to be a lot of things I simply haven't done yet..\n\nAlso, there are a lot of people on the forums bashing the game for one reason or another, some reasons are valid, some aren't.    I would argue that most of those people really haven't truly experienced the game in its fullest, but at the same time I will concede the point that if it doesn't appeal to them early on, it may not later either and that they should just move on without the flames.\n\nWhat you're not seeing on the forums is the influx of praise or posts by people who are largely happy, not because they don't exist but rather because the complainers are typically a lot more vocal minority.. People that complain loudly are typically those people who think they are righteous and have entitlement issues..  They are \"right and by god you're gonna know my opinion..\"\n\nSo with that -- here's my righteous opinion on the the first 15 levels of fed play and the first 12 or so of Klingon.. I only really have 2 major complaints.\n\nBut first some general over arching comments -- please keep in mind there is no order to my thoughts;\n\nThe server's are completely flooded and Cryptic wasn't ready for the load.. Completely understandable if you consider that they just opened up the beta for quite possibly the single most popular science fiction IP on the planet. (Is star trek more popular than star wars? I don't actually know..) They are aware of the issue and have stated repeatedly that they are taking action to fix it. Kudos guys.\n\nI have seen people bitch that \"this has been the worst beta ever\" and that simply isn't true.  Not even close.  I'm pretty sure Anarchy Online still holds that title firmly, and likely will forever..  In fact I don't really think this beta has been all that bad considering the volume of traffic they are getting.. Sure there are queues, server lag, and disconnects but all of those are brought about by the volume of players..  In fact the majority of the issues the game has can likely be traced back to simple server lag due to volume.\n\nIs it bug free?  no.   But then neither is WoW or EQ and those games have been out for years. I don't really understand why people expect a brand new game to be bug free.. *shrug*  I do take it as a very positive sign that they have patched the game every night during the open beta..  That implies to me that they are actively working on the issues which is great.\n\nI think the game graphics look good.. I have seen quite a few threads on the forums about how they graphics look poor, and I just don't agree.  It doesn't look photo realistic like some of the very early preview teaser images did years ago, but that's okay.. It looks good and succeeds in suspending my disbelief into thinking I'm playing a game in a Star Trek universe.\n\nThe UI is good though the map system needs to be better explained. It took me a while to understand the area map and the galaxy map and why some systems were in my system list some of the time, and not in my list other parts of the time..etc.. It's easy once you understand it but completely confusing while you don't..  Lack of documentation or explanation is almost a theme in this game..\n\nThe skills are confusing but mostly because they don't explain what they do well enough. It also doesn't explain well enough things like your characters class to ship class combination's.. Is it a bad idea to be an engineer, in a science ship? Why? If it is bad that means if you go science you're stuck in the same 2 ships for 20 levels.. ouch.. (maybe longer, I don't know what ships are available at T3)\n\nWhat does +18 in Science Vessel Captain actually do for me? Games like WoW, Eve, and even Champions to some degree have a LOT of math behind it.. This game clearly does too but you don't really expose that math to the players in a clear way. A lot of players, myself included, actually enjoy pondering the right character build and the best way we can achieve what it is we want to such a degree as to actually build spreadsheets.. Eve is a game totally about spreadsheets ( a little too spreadsheety at times ) and players love that.. Expose those numbers to us.. Let us know what skilling up something actually does, or all of those skills you invested all that time in to create for us mean nothing.\n\nI'm sure all of these things will be documented eventually but right now it smacks of information that the developers all know and think of as obvious where as the players coming to it for the first time just stand there confused.   Documentation is your friend.\n\nThe ground combat is a little weak right now and I personally think it's boring, repetitive and painfully scripted but I think it will develop over time.  It very much smacks of CoH door missions and that system needs more versatility.  Give players options that change the outcome.. etc..   I can't say as I enjoy the ground combat much though because every game to date has been about ground combat.  I'm much more interested in the space combat, that being said they still have a lot of work to do on the ground if they plan to serve both..\n\nAs to space combat, Right now I can say I really enjoy it though it gets very \"samey\" pretty quickly.    I think that's largely due to the fact that I have experienced basically 4 ships total..  And flying around seeing nothing (mostly) but Miranda ships get's old..\n\nPersonally I hope there are a lot more ships in the game come release.  I love how the ships are customizable but there still aren't enough chassis and what not to choose from.  Maybe that gets better later on, but in the beginning its weak as you have 1 ship.  Then when you level up to get your tier two ships, you have a choice of three technically but since you already decided your officer type (tactical, engineer or science) you only really have 1 logical choice.\n\nI think players identify with their avatars a lot more than most game creators take into account and as such they need to give us even more options.  Plus the ability to add fleet markings would be handy.  It's minor I know, but it helps establish community and a sense of pride which is important in an MMO.\n\nI could make a long list of other complaints like, why did they go with left and right versus port and starboard.. Or why isn't there any Klingon PVE play etc.. but really at this point I'd rather talk about whats there than what's NOT there.. So with that -- I have two complaints:\n\nMajor Complaint One -- One of the worst mistakes they could make in this game is the same thing that in my mind killed the City franchise and Champions..  I'm gonna call it \"Mission leveling\" for the lack of a better term. The concept is this;  You get a mission and the more people that do the mission with you, the harder the mission gets.   So if you solo a mission you fight one or two weak mobs, but if you bring a whole group suddenly its 3 or 4 hard hitting bosses and several weaker mobs..etc..\n\nSounds like a good idea on the surface, but CoH and CO proved it to be a horrible idea because it actually encourages players to NOT group.. this kills the need for \"community\"..  More over it gives players no sense of accomplishment because they know a mission is simply a cake walk if they solo it.  There should be things in the game that require groups and missions should be statically leveled.  Do away with this balancing thing..It's a failed experiment..\n\nYou should be able to get missions that are so hard you can't do it without help..  Missions that scale like they do is just a bad design and this is the third time they have done it..\n\nA mission that is the same level as you, should present you with mobs that are roughly the same as you.. If it's a higher level mission they should be harder hitting.. if it's lower level they should be weaker..etc..\n\nI realize that this is very much the WoW and EQ model for doing quests but it has stood the test of time and it's a known..  Right now I can't help but think they have broken this very simple concept.\n\nMajor Complaint Two --  I want crafting.. I want to be able to harvest asteroids like in Eve and create stuff.. I can't fathom an MMO game that has virtually no crafting system what so ever..  And sorry but the current system they have that they say is like crafting simply isn't.\n\nMindlessly warping around a mission looking for the various anomolies that you get crap from that let you turn in for an upgraded item.. yeah that's not crafting.. I hope they fix that..\n\nIn the end there is a little bit of the \"city of star trek\" that I was worried about in my earlier post.  There is a little bit of champions in it.. there is a little of city in it.. etc..  Cryptic is going with what they know.. But they might have enough of a winner here because its sort of two games in one (space and ground) and with the addition of PVP in both places you sorta have 4 games in one..  Now consider the ability to play both sides, federation or klingon and now its x2 again..\n\nThere might be enough different options to keep this game going for a while.. I'm enjoying it for now at least..\n","collection":"posts","url":"/game-review-star-trek-online-2/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2010-01-23-german-type-vii-submarine.md","collection":"posts","url":"/german-type-vii-submarine/","path":"_posts/2010-01-23-german-type-vii-submarine.md","id":"/german-type-vii-submarine","draft":false,"categories":["Hobbies"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"German Type VII Submarine","layout":"post","tags":["3D Model"],"image":"/images/2010/01/type-vii-15.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2010-01-23 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"german-type-vii-submarine","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2010-01-19-game-review-star-trek-online-2.md","excerpt":"Here's my righteous opinion on the the first 15 levels of fed play and the first 12 or so of Klingon..

I have refined the hull shape a lot so that now the top deck area is actually the shape it should be for holding the conning tower and what not.  But more importantly I have actually added those side bulges to the model such that they are part of the main layer and can be subdivided nicely.  No more having one model poke through another model.  Ding! \"You have gained a level!\"\n\nIt may sound like a simple thing but it's actually complex if you're coming from hard body modeling to subdivision modeling.\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2010/01/type-vii-03.jpg\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img src=\"/images/2010/01/type-vii-03-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Front Wire Cutters</span></a>\n\n__+3 hours - Front wire cutters__ - So I spent the better part of these three hours getting the front wire cutters (I guess that's what they are) looking right under subd and making sure they smoothly transitioned into the rest of the mesh.  Good times.  It took longer than I wanted because I had some serious symmetry issues that I wasn't sure how to sort out.  Thankfully, Modo has a Symmetry tool that does it all for you!  It's just magic.. No clue how the hell that works.\n\nI have also been researching what I want the top part of the boat to look like.. I wanted to keep the boat as accurate as possible and my research has lead me to believe that every fricken one of these boats was different..  For some reason I had it in my mind that manufacturing back then would be similar to how it is today.. But I guess I have to keep in mind that these things were built one at a time and each one was hand crafted.. So they tend to be a tad different from one another..\n\nThe more I work on this the more I think I would really like to visit a real one of these if for no other reason than to just gawk at it..\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2010/01/type-vii-04.jpg\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"type-vii-04\" src=\"/images/2010/01/type-vii-04-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Conning Tower</span></a>\n\n__+ 5 hours - The beginnings of a conning tower __- I started and restarted this conning tower probably 10 times and even now I'm not 100% happy with it.   I kept going back and forth with the design as well as the number of tiers it would have.  This one has 2 which means this is a type VII-C or later as it will have two flak guns as opposed to only one.\n\nIt's been hard to find plans with anything close to this so a lot of what I am doing comes from <a href=\"http://www.bismarck-class.dk/shipmodels/german_models/uviicbaz.html\" target=\"_blank\">this kit built by Guillermo Martinez Baz</a>..  Nice looking model Guillermo..\n\nThe shape of the tower has a lot of gentle curves and odd shapes so I have had to play with and learn the falloff tools a lot better in modo.. It was a great learning experience but I didn't get a lot of work done for the 5 hours I spent on it..\n\nAlso the more I study Guillermo's real world plastic model, the more I think my model is way off in some places..  My decking at the top of the model for example isn't correct by a long shot.  Probably want I'm going to do is actually build an inner cigar shaped tube where the people would be to get some idea of why the exterior is shaped the way it is..\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2010/01/type-vii-05.jpg\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"type-vii-05\" src=\"/images/2010/01/type-vii-05-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>First Actual Render</span></a>\n\n__+2 hours - The first actual render__ - So here you have the very first render of my entirely incomplete Type VII-C German U-Boat.  My goal is to have it render out with that underwater look but for now I'm going to make it really bright so I can see all the defects..\n\nI still have a very long way to go.. I'm still working on the conning tower area as that will have a lot of detail.  I need to merge the two layers too so that the conning tower actually connects to the sub body, as right now they don't.  Still having fun!  That's what counts..\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2010/01/type-vii-06.jpg\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img src=\"/images/2010/01/type-vii-06-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Details and Lighting</span></a>\n\n__+4 hours - Adding detail and lighting__ - So there isn't much of a change to the model here other than for details that are hard to see, and the obvious lighting differences.  I'm going to be making the necessary detail changes to the model to make it look better and better slowly over time, but I'm also going to be working on texturing and lighting while I can.\n\nI have also learned that its not necessary to make everything part of the main mesh.. It's okay to have sub-d elements in different layers so long as it looks okay.  The idea being if in the real world something is made of a single piece of metal then sure one layer is appropriate, otherwise more than one is fine..\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2010/01/type-vii-07.jpg\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img src=\"/images/2010/01/type-vii-07-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Tail Features</span></a>\n\n__+7 hours - Tail Features__ - I have spent a good portion of the day working on the tail features of my sub as well as generally mucking around with the over all look of the boat.   But primarily, the rear dive plains, propeller shafts, rudders, supports, struts..etc..  I have a long way to go but this put a nice dent into the rear features that up to this point were completely missing.\n\nDuring this process it occurred to me that I don't know which way the props should be twisted.. And I kind of assumed that they counter rotate.. So if that is way off some one please tell me..  The rudders are actually to scale according to the plans I have but damn they look big.. And my plans arent accurate at all with how far apart the propellers are, and so I did my best to \"Guesstimate\" and I think I blew it..  They seem a little too close together..\n\nThe more I work on this thing the more I hate how some of it has come out.. I spent such a long time getting those side bulges working and now I think they are too prominent..  The top decking is all wrong too in a few places..   Still I know I should give myself a break.. I mean this wont be a perfect thing no matter how hard I try.. I just don't have the skills yet..  But I am going to work at it..  But my dreams of making this thing photo realistic likely wont happen at all..\n\nAnd I haven't even started to ruin the textures..\n\n__+10 hours - Still going!__ - Okay so I don't have a picture this update..  I'm in the process of correcting a horrible mistake I made..   At some point I subdivided the entire main hull and it caused a lot of odd rendering artifacts.. I was pretty upset that I had done this at first because apparently I did it days ago and didn't even notice!  Luckily I make daily backups of my model and I work in a lot of layers.. so thankfully its only a matter of using the old hull and bringing it back up to date, preferably without making the same mistake..\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2010/01/type-vii-10.jpg\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"type-vii-10\" src=\"/images/2010/01/type-vii-10-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Yay for rails</span></a>\n\n__+5 hours - Yay for rails__ - I'm guessing todays installment was roughly five hours worth of work..  Hard to say really in that it wasn't a straight piece of work..  It's really a continuation of work I did last night, and what little work I did today in between bug fixing for work which has been going on at a rabid pace..  Every hour or two I spend 20 minutes or so on the model... The bug fixing is killing me so this makes a nice change of pace..\n\nIn this update you'll see I'm starting to add lots and lots of railing everywhere... Ah good times..  I have also completely fixed the ugly striation crap that managed to work its way into the model because I was a dolt and did something stupid..\n\nPart of this fix was also to correct some big errors with the conning tower.. I still have a lot of work to do.. but its coming along nicely..\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2010/01/steelrope02.jpg\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"steelrope02\" src=\"/images/2010/01/steelrope02-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Steel Rope</span></a>\n\n__+5 hours - Steel Rope__ - I just got done spending the better part of the entire 5 hours learning to make rope.  3D rope that is..  The sub has quite a lot of steel rope hanging from various points on the hull and I wanted to get that to look right.\n\nAt first I just created a really long cylinder and sliced it up with the intent of just adding a 3D texture or displacement to make it look like strands of steel rope.. but it just looked crappy.. So, I had to actually create stranded rope..  This took me a long time and I had to get pretty intimate with Modo's Twist tool and the Soft Move tool..\n\nI still think the way I ultimately did it, was the wrong way..  I should have used a path and cloned <a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2010/01/steelrope01.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">a single rope</a> piece along that path, but it didn't work..  No matter what I tried, I just couldn't get the curve clone tool to output something that looked reasonable..  Plus it was REALLY laggy bringing modo to a stop trying to clone a &lt;1000 polygon item 100 times..  100,000 polygons isn't that heavy so I have no idea why it was struggling so hard with it.. I also tried to use a custom python script suggested to me on the modo forums called CurveDeformer, but it failed too.. (in odd ways) .. SO I was left to my own devices..\n\nIt took me too long to do this though.. I mean seriously ~5 hours to figure out this ONE thing.. sheesh..\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2010/01/type-vii-12.jpg\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"type-vii-12\" src=\"/images/2010/01/type-vii-12-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Steel Rope Details</span></a>\n\n__+3 hours - Steel Rope Detail__ - So I spent the majority of this time getting the steel rope finished on the back side of the boat.  It now hangs correctly between the two rail uprights on the back of the boat in such a way as to imply weight..  In the tail of the boat it rides over the risers in a ring then down into a hull point where its anchored.  And its simply wrapped around the lower conning tower platform rail and clamped together using a pair of wire clamps.  This isn't how it was actually done, but I thought having the wire simply wrapped around the rail and secured with a couple wire clamps made it look more real..   Very excited as to how it turned out.. I think it looks fantastic..\n\nThis model is starting to get rather beefy.. It's already a 5 meg file and renders out at over 3 million polygons, 15 million with subsampling turned on.  I call that starting to get heavy..  I know that a lot of the models the big boys work with are vast by comparison, but then so is the hardware they use..\n\nGonna keep working on this thing.. I haven't been playing any games at all since I started this project, its kept me that entertained.. Tomorrow I'm going to continue poking the detail holes in the side of the boat.. Good times.\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2010/01/type-vii-13.jpg\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"type-vii-13\" src=\"/images/2010/01/type-vii-13-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Poking holes</span></a>\n\n__+8 hours - Poking holes in the model__ -  For todays installment of \"make a sub\" I have been concentrating on poking holes in the side of the main hull mesh.  It's actually exceedingly difficult because of the non-linear off axis subd modeling method I'm using, combined with round holes..   I have to say so far so good!   I have a lot more holes to poke, and I need to add inner piping and details that could be visible from the outside..  This means I need to build a very basic model of what the internal cigar tube will look like and the basic support structures..  I have no clue what those actually should look like so I might just make it up..\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2010/01/type-vii-14.jpg\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"type-vii-14\" src=\"/images/2010/01/type-vii-14-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Waist Steel Cable</span></a>\n\nI also spent a chunk of my time adding the waist steel cables to the waist railings..   I went to a lot of trouble too wrapping the cable around the railings in a believable way..  I think it turned out pretty damn good if I do say so myself.. Though looking at it now in some areas I should have added a tad more twist to the cable, but since each cable is actually a strand of six cylinders its a pain in the rump to go back and change it now..  I'm really glad I went this route though as opposed to the one cylinder that gets textured into wire..  The actual twisted polygons while heavy in terms of polycount, really adds a lot in terms of details..\n\nI have to say I'm still have a great deal of fun making this model.. that bodes very well..  Typically when I do these things, they last for a couple of weeks before I want to move on to something else, but this model is really inspiring me to keep going..  It's been really cool seeing how each piece comes together to add up to more and more detail..   Every so often I scroll up to the top of this post and look at where it started and then look at where I am..  I realize I have a long way to go, but I have come a LONG way..\n\nI want to find some more pictures of real Type VII's up close so I can get a good idea of what the hull plating should actually look like.   I dunno if I should model that or just texture it..

Those who love it can play it.. I for one very likely wont be and there are two primary reasons for this;\n\n* The people playing are douche bags\n* Just like SC1, the game is wildly out of balance\n\nI'm playing in the friend and family beta and STILL the people I play against are rabid pricks..  People say all the time that MMO (WoW specifically) players are rude and jerks, and I have to say they are nothing compared to the Starcraft players..   It's like all the lame ass epeen stuff you see in MMO's that a player does over the course of the year or two he plays the game is compressed into one 20 minute game and so they have to be extra big douche bags just to be sure you know how uber they are and how much you suck..\n\nI want to play any game of this nature against my friends or coworkers, and no one else.. I don't want to have to suffer the fanboy jackasses who feel the need to tell you how much you suck every five minutes just to make themselves feel better..   I mean seriously how pathetic are you that you have to continually tell others they suck to make yourself feel better..\n\nMy second point is the balance issue..  I'm sorry but I always felt Starcraft 1 was out of balance..   Well guess what.. Starcraft 2 is also unbalanced..  And you'd think that Blizzard might take it as a clue that if everyone is playing one race, and no one is playing another race.. there's a reason for it.\n\nI just got finished playing a 2v2 game in which the opponents partner quit about 10 seconds into the game..  So it was actually a 2v1 game with 2 Zerg players versus 1 Terran player.\n\nI always play Zerg, and this was the VERY FIRST TIME I had seen another player intentionally play Zerg..  In all the other games I have played so far, everyone plays Terran..  Clue one that Terran are over powered is that everyone plays them.. I have seen a few folks play protoss but not many..\n\nAnd We played for something like 45 minutes, two Zerg versus one Terran and couldn't beat him.  2v1 and we lost.    We used up ALL the resources on the map and weren't able to get him out of his bolt hole..   Yes.. ALL of the resources.. I had 6 bases by the end of the game and my partner had 4..  The opponent just proceeded to nuke us into oblivion and all the attacking we did in the world did no good what so ever..\n\nHe had SWARMS of stuff flying and running around, was poking us from all sides as well as a continual nuke spam, and was mounting an impossible defense of our combined and organized attacks..  And he only ever had 2 bases.. He also had ample time to tell us how much we sucked..\n\nI know I'm not great at this game.. but I'm not that darn bad.. and my partner seemed to know what he was doing..  I think it's a pretty clear case of one side being over powered..\n\nI tried to ask the Terran player what he was doing and he proceeded to tell me how great he was and how my parents should be embarrassed they gave birth to me...   This is a friend or a family member of a Blizzard employee..   Fine.. Fuck you.. You can have this game, I don't want it..\n","collection":"posts","url":"/im-about-to-say-fuck-starcraft-2/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2010-02-27-im-about-to-say-fuck-starcraft-2.md","collection":"posts","url":"/im-about-to-say-fuck-starcraft-2/","path":"_posts/2010-02-27-im-about-to-say-fuck-starcraft-2.md","id":"/im-about-to-say-fuck-starcraft-2","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"I'm about to say fuck Starcraft 2","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2010-02-27 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"im-about-to-say-fuck-starcraft-2","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2010-03-08-ubisoft-and-their-drm.md","content":"<a rel='lightbox' href=\"/images/2010/03/drm.jpg\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"drm\" src=\"/images/2010/03/drm-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Stop the DRM</span></a>\n\nWhen will companies learn that their draconian efforts to prevent piracy only serves to hurt their paying customers which directly affects their bottom line!!\n\nCompanies, you must stop counting pirated copies of your software as \"lost revenue\" -- it's not!  Someone who is willing to pirate software isn't willing to pay for it.. EVER!  So you never had their money in the first place..\n\nYou're trying so hard to capture that imagined lost revenue that it's blinding you to how badly you're screwing yourselves and your real customers..\n\nEquating the number of pirated copies of your software directly to dollars is retarded.. More over, implementing these harsh DRM models only serves to prevent the honest players from playing your games, which effectively assures that you're going to lose real money in the form of people who actually DO buy your games going else where..\n\nLet take the new Silent Hunter 5 game as an example..   SH5 (a game with a lot of bugs and other issues that already pisses paying customers off) comes with the new DRM which forces you to be connected to the internet 100% of the time.   The new system which the Ubisoft exec's spin as being a positive thing for the customer is constantly phoning home to make sure you're still allowed to play the game.. The game you purchased.\n\nIf at any time during your play period the connection to the mother ship fails, you stop playing the game.  You can't save your game.. You can't do anything..  Effectively the game you purchased goes into cripple ware mode..  This is bullshit.\n\nThe hacker community took one good look at that and said \"F'to you Ubi\" and hacked it within the first 24 hours of release..  These people had no intention of buying the game in the first place so who does it actually hurt?\n\nME!  If I'm playing the game that I purchased and I go on a road trip with my laptop, I can't play it..  The hacker can.. he can play just fine..\n\nIf I am playing the game that I purchased at home and for whatever reason my internet goes out (it happens), I'm screwed..   Not the hacker.. He can keep playing..\n\nSo.. whats my recourse?  Nothing.. I'm just shit out of luck.. I have to either accept their crappy DRM because apparently they think I'm the problem, or not buy the game in the first place..  The hacker doesn't care, he isn't troubled by these problems at all and in no way has the DRM affected him at all..\n\nDRM only punishes the paying customer!  Ubisoft is trying like hell to spin their new DRM in a positive light, but it's not..  they claim that it's \"A platform of online services for PC titles offering gamers a more in-depth gaming experience as well as providing an innovative solution for reducing PC game piracy.\"   HUH?!\n\nHow did you do either of those things?   It does absolutely NOTHING to offer me a more in-depth gaming experience and in fact does the opposite in that suddenly I have this invasive piece of software on my system that prevents me from playing at all from time to time..  I paid for the game, yet I'm punished.\n\nAnd it doesn't prevent or even reduce software piracy considering it was hacked out in the first 24 hours.  The hackers never even notice the games DRM, it doesn't bother them in the slightest..\n\nAt this point you're actually encouraging people like me to hack the game because your own DRM is preventing the honest player from playing the game he paid for..  That's right.. your DRM which is there to prevent piracy is actually encouraging piracy because otherwise we can't play the game..  Good job genius..\n\nYou're so busy counting the imaginary lost dollars you're missing the fact that your real dollars are heading out the door.. The proof is in the pudding.. Your current sales for this year are down by over 20% and I have to think you only have yourselves to blame..\n\nI realize fully that the \"higher ups\" are the ones making these decisions, but someone MUST stand up and tell them why DRM is not the right solution..  If you guys don't stop the DRM shenanigans you guys are going to hemorrhage not money, but customers..\n","collection":"posts","url":"/ubisoft-and-their-drm/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2010-03-15-8mm-mauser-reloading.md","collection":"posts","url":"/8mm-mauser-reloading/","path":"_posts/2010-03-15-8mm-mauser-reloading.md","id":"/8mm-mauser-reloading","draft":false,"categories":["Hobbies"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"8mm Mauser Reloading","layout":"post","tags":["Shooting","Reloading"],"image":"/images/2010/03/reloadpress-150x150.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2010-03-15 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"8mm-mauser-reloading","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2010-03-08-ubisoft-and-their-drm.md","excerpt":"When will companies learn that their draconian efforts to prevent piracy only serves to hurt their paying customers which directly affects their bottom line!!","id":"/ubisoft-and-their-drm","draft":false,"categories":["Games","Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Ubisoft and their DRM","layout":"post","tags":["Ubisoft","DRM"],"image":"/images/2010/03/drm.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2010-03-08 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"ubisoft-and-their-drm","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2010-02-27-im-about-to-say-fuck-starcraft-2.md","excerpt":"So I have been playing in the Starcraft 2 beta and to be honest, I'm not overly impressed.  It's basically the same game brought forward with some refinement..  Fine..
