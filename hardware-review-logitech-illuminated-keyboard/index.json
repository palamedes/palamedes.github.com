I feel I have a pretty good handle on the genre and have a very good idea of what makes a game good, and what makes a game bad.  Both in terms of what I personally feel, and as well as taking a broader view as a whole.  I can readily recognize why one game or another may not appeal to me, but be appealing to others.\n\nWhat's interesting is that I find that as time has gone on I have had to lower my expectations because none of contemporary games are ever as good as the now lofty memories of the games of old..\n\nI fully realize that it's not fair of me to compare a modern game to the memory of a previous game.  A memory full of good times, good people and fun events.  Memories that I generally cherish in some way, oh and there was a game involved too..\n\nAion Online is the first game in a long time that actually holds up under this scrutiny..  I was shocked..\n\nGenerally I use three games as my virtual yard sticks;  Ultima Online, because it was basically the first and implemented many things correctly, and many more incorrectly.  Everquest, again because it was ground breaking and a first but also because many of the things that made it most memorable are absolutely horrible by todays standards.  Ah memories.  And finally World of Warcraft because it's everything that Everquest wasn't -- including good in some cases.  I played all three of those games for at least more than 2 years.. Five in the case of EQ, and am still playing WoW as I type this though I can honestly say that I dread it at times..\n\nAion Online might find itself added to that yardstick for comparison to future games..\n\nInitially I was a bit horrified by the notion of a JRPG style game.. The very thought of a game in which the women were high pitch voiced busty school girls with bobbed hair and the men where androgynous she-males wielding swords you would otherwise need a forklift to move didn't exactly excite me.. Still doesn't to be honest, but that's not what Aion is..\n\nWhile I have seen a few extremely improbable swords the rest of the game isn't bad at all..   The JRPG aspect is fairly minor all things considered and the game itself is beautiful and full of depth.\n\nThe game itself isn't super innovative in that they really have only one thing that other games don't have and thats flight..  Their flight model is really great and does a lot for the game once you figure it out.  Flight has two modes;  Flying and Gliding.  When you glide, you have a chance of finding thermals and can soar just like a bird!   The only down side to flight is that no matter how you go about it you can only do it for so long bfeore you have to rest..\n\nEverything else is what you would expect, but done very well.. The game engine works well, if maybe a tad laggy from time to time and of course looks fantastic as it's based on the crysis engine..\n\nMy only true concern at this point is the end game.. It touts a brand new end game that they are calling PVPVE.. which is code for PVE while some one ganks you..  I'm not fooled..  But at the same time I havent' experienced it yet.. Maybe its good..\n\nI'll have to wait and see..\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2009-10-03-delphi-like-idevcl-for-javascript-written-in-javascript.md","url":"/delphi-like-idevcl-for-javascript-written-in-javascript/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-10-03-delphi-like-idevcl-for-javascript-written-in-javascript.md","id":"/delphi-like-idevcl-for-javascript-written-in-javascript","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Software Development"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Delphi like IDE/VCL for Javascript, written in javascript","layout":"post","tags":["jQuery"],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-10-03 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"delphi-like-idevcl-for-javascript-written-in-javascript","ext":".md"},"url":"/game-review-aion-online/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-10-06-game-review-aion-online.md","id":"/game-review-aion-online","collection":"posts","excerpt":"I have played a lot of MMO's in my time..

(*cough*Eclipse*cough*)\n\nSo my thought is.. How useful would that be for javascript?  This fits in nicely with a project I'm doing at work in that some of the same concepts are there..    You have a framework in the background that all this rests on (lets call it a desktop), then on top of that you have delphi like \"forms\" (lets call them viewlets) which are nothing more than a window framework container.  Each viewlet would have components that would be pulled from a common component library that you have positioned how you see fit and now have working how you want.\n\nWith jQuery it would be fairly simple to allow for any kind of function definitions; from onclicks to mouseovers.. Custom code would be simple and all of that could easily be serialized into a simple object definition that would be easy to store remotely..\n\nYou would need a \"component inspector\" like object that allowed you to edit and change things within a viewlet but once that's done you simply disable the component inspector and you're off to the races..\n\nThere are a lot of good javascript frameworks but they all come at this problem from the other direction.. More over there aren't any drag and drop Delphi like application creation tools out there for javascript and certainly not any written entirely in javascript..\n\nFor work I am creating a whole new system and I was thinking of how I could keep it easy enough that third party developers could design and create their own viewlets for our system.. That's when this whole thing plonked itself into my head..   If you designed it from the onset to be a system that could be entirely dynamically done then it would take very little programming on the part of the third party creator to get something new.. They don't even need to know the framework because they could simply drag and drop the components they want onto a form (I have a hard time calling it a viewlet) then you'd have drop down boxes in the component inspector to attach information to that component..\n\nAt that point its just a matter of making your components sophisticated enough to provide the functionality you want..  The other nice thing is your shop goes from being application developers to simply being component developers..  If the framework works, you simply need to continue to develop better and better components..  You aren't rewriting the wheel each time you want to make a change..\n\nThere would need to be some back end code in place to handle the storage of user generated forms, but all HTML, CSS, JPGS, and Components as well as the window framework and desktop are already written.  They don't change. \n\nFrom a support standpoint it would be nice to give your support folks a way to pop-up some kind of component inspector widget that would allow you to browse components and forms on the fly.. etc.. \n\nI dunno.. its one of those things I was pondering.. I know I wont be allowed to do this for work but it amuses me..\n","previous":{"next":{"path":"_posts/2009-10-03-delphi-like-idevcl-for-javascript-written-in-javascript.md","url":"/delphi-like-idevcl-for-javascript-written-in-javascript/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-10-03-delphi-like-idevcl-for-javascript-written-in-javascript.md","id":"/delphi-like-idevcl-for-javascript-written-in-javascript","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Software Development"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Delphi like IDE/VCL for Javascript, written in javascript","layout":"post","tags":["jQuery"],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-10-03 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"delphi-like-idevcl-for-javascript-written-in-javascript","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2009-10-01-hardware-review-logitech-illuminated-keyboard.md","output":null,"content":"<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2009/10/logitech_illuminated_keyboard.jpg\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Logitech Illuminated Keyboard\" src=\"/images/2009/10/logitech_illuminated_keyboard-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Logitech Illuminated Keyboard\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Logitech Illuminated Keyboard</span></a>\n\nI have to admit I like Logitech.  Their hardware is always good.  I find their software is a little bloated and doesn't always deliver but I can't fault the hardware at all..\n\nSo when I was in the market for a new keyboard I naturally gravitated towards the Logitech flock of peripherals..  I was replacing my old Logitech G15 which is a great device but at this point it had so much dust, dirt and kibble between the keys I was horrified to touch it.   (Mmmm keyboard kibble)\n\nI liked the G15, but it had issues; the primary one being, I rubbed all the paint off the keys.   Apparently I type a little hard for the first generation G15's and ended up removing the surface paint of the home row and several commonly pressed keys.   You could tell where my fingers and hands always sat.\n\nI also never.. ever.. used the left side macro buttons or any of the other wiz-bang features of the keyboard.  It was wasted on me.  Hell for almost a year I didn't even install the keyboard software for the little video display..

I likes it.\n\nFlat:  The other thing is the profile of the keyboard.   It's less than 10mm in height..  It's flat!! like.. super flat..   It almost feels like I'm typing on my desk itself instead of some device.   What's nice about this is when you get up and walk away, that flat keyboard makes my work area as a whole look uncluttered and clean.\n\nAll in all its a good thing and gets high praise from me..\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2009-09-28-carl-sagan-a-glorious-dawn.md","url":"/carl-sagan-a-glorious-dawn/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-09-28-carl-sagan-a-glorious-dawn.md","id":"/carl-sagan-a-glorious-dawn","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Carl Sagan - A Glorious Dawn","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2009/09/carl.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-09-28 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"carl-sagan-a-glorious-dawn","ext":".md"},"url":"/hardware-review-logitech-illuminated-keyboard/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-10-01-hardware-review-logitech-illuminated-keyboard.md","id":"/hardware-review-logitech-illuminated-keyboard","collection":"posts","excerpt":"I have to admit I like Logitech.  Their hardware is always good.  I find their software is a little bloated and doesn't always deliver but I can't fault the hardware at all..","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Hardware Review: Logitech Illuminated Keyboard","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2009/10/logitech_illuminated_keyboard.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-10-01 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"hardware-review-logitech-illuminated-keyboard","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2009-09-28-carl-sagan-a-glorious-dawn.md","output":null,"content":"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgiXGELjbc\" class='pull-right' target='_blank'><img title=\"Carl Sagan\" src=\"/images/2009/09/carl.jpg\" alt=\"Carl Sagan - A Glorious Dawn\" width=\"323\" height=\"195\" /></a>\n\nThe following is a wonderful and fitting tribute to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan\" target=\"_blank\">Carl Sagan</a> created by John Boswell over at <a href=\"http://colorpulsemusic.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ColorPulse Music</a>.   It was done in the form of a music video using exerpts from Carls 13 part television series aired in the late seventies; Cosmos: A Personal Voyage.   It also features Stephen Hawking and I have to admit it is really well done.. \n\nI felt it needed to be posted and passed on.  I recommend watching it all the way through several times..  Enjoy..\n\nYouTube: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgiXGELjbc\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgiXGELjbc</a>\nColorPulse:  <a href=\"http://colorpulsemusic.com/youtube.html\">http://colorpulsemusic.com/youtube.html</a>\n\n","previous":{"next":{"path":"_posts/2009-09-28-carl-sagan-a-glorious-dawn.md","url":"/carl-sagan-a-glorious-dawn/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-09-28-carl-sagan-a-glorious-dawn.md","id":"/carl-sagan-a-glorious-dawn","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Carl Sagan - A Glorious Dawn","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2009/09/carl.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-09-28 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"carl-sagan-a-glorious-dawn","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2009-09-25-1055-miles-on-two-wheels.md","output":null,"content":"<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2009/09/Motorcycle-Pic-2.JPG\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Motorcycle Closeup\" src=\"/images/2009/09/Motorcycle-Pic-2-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Smile! Yer about to get wet!\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Smile! Yer about to get wet!</span></a>\n\nSo my father turned 68 this year.  I thought it would be a nice gift to give him my tractor lawn mower and a few other items that I knew he could use that I simply no longer needed.   The main issue was getting the tractor to him.. I mean this thing aint small and I no longer have a truck..  I decided the best bet would be to rent a truck and haul it to him..  It's a thousand mile trip from my home in Texas to his in Tennissee and I didn't really look forward to that drive in that truck..  I certainly didn't want to make it twice!    So I also loaded up my Motorcycle with the plan of riding it back.\n\nFirst to the truck;  I rented a Penske 16' truck and told the lady on the phone what I wanted to do.  She didn't seem to care, even though once I got the truck they label on the wall said no gasoline powered vehicles..  *shrug* I told her what I was planning to do, so as far as I was concerned I was okayed to do it..  The mower was out of gas anyway and the motorcycle had very little in it.. I think their intent was to keep you from causing a fire and that was my intent too, so all was well..\n\nLoading everything into the truck was a bit tough since the wheels on the mower were wider than the ramp hehe.. but once in the truck everything was fine..  I had LOTS of room to spare, but it was the smallest truck I could get.. ( and the cheapest)\n\nThe reason I rented Penske was because they were down right cheap compared to everyone else, and the truck was a  nice one for the most part.. Extremely minimalistic and it seriously needed cruise control.. but other than that it was a good truck.  I was able to rent it for $230..  U-Haul wanted almost $900!!!  The other places I called were either just as expensive or wouldn't let me take the truck out of state..   Yay Penske!  You just earned my business..\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2009/09/Motorcycle-Pic-1.JPG\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"Motorcycle Ride\" src=\"/images/2009/09/Motorcycle-Pic-1-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Getting ready to go.. woops didn't smile\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Getting ready to go.. woops didn&#39;t smile</span></a>\n\nOnce I got everything loaded up I headed out..  The trip to TN from TX was fairly uneventful.. I ended up not leaving until around 6pm just due to circumstances beyond my control so I knew I would be driving kind of late.. Around 2am I decided I was tired and needed to stop.. I only got about 450 miles..  The second day I got up at 9am and made it the rest of the way, getting to their house around 9pm their time.   I wish that truck didn't have a speed governor in it..  It flat out wouldn't go faster than 75 miles an hour, unless you were going down hill.   And at 80 miles an hour it would kick in an engine break and you'd slow down no matter what!\n\nOver the course of the next several days I got to hang out with my father, step mother and step brother..  It was a nice time..  We didn't really do an awful lot, just visit  mostly..  We went out to eat a couple times and went walking through the sprawling metropolis of their small town (it took about 15 minutes..hehe)..\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2009/09/CatandDog.JPG\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Bella and Maggie\" src=\"/images/2009/09/CatandDog-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Bella and Maggie\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Bella and Maggie</span></a>\n\nAnd of course I got to play with Maggie (the dog) and Bella (the cat) when they would tollerate me.   Maggie was just about never there but rather out trolling the neighborhood, Bella was a constant bundle of energy and was quite amusing to watch.. Kittens always are..\n\nI kept telling Dianne I was gonna take bella home with me =)  I might have too had I known it would have been a sure fire way of being kicked out of the family.. hehe  Bella seemed pretty attached to Dianne..  So much so she followed her around like a shadow..\n\nThe only down side about the whole trip to be honest was how tired I was..  I have no idea how Ed drives all day long like he does.. Driving long distance wears me out.. I think partly because it bores me, but traveling in general just makes me tired..   The truck drive up there in the rain, in a vehicle I wasn't really comfortable in, going someplace I had never driven to before..etc.. only served to tire me.\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2009/09/Tired.JPG\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"Me (tired), Dad (amused)\" src=\"/images/2009/09/Tired-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Me (tired), Dad (amused)\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Me (tired), Dad (amused)</span></a>\n\nAdd to this now the fact that I would be sleeping the next 3 days on a pull out sofa bed that had a bar strategically placed to keep guests from overstaying their welcome, and that generally speaking my folks get up about 2 hours before I do and you begin to see the issue..   I just didn't get much sleep..  I was tired to begin with, sleeping on an uncomfortable and foreign bed, in a house that isn't mine, with folks who get up before I normally do ..etc..   I was doomed to be tired.. hehe\n\nMy wife actually commented to me on one of the few occasions I had cell service while up there that I looked completely zonked.. She was amazed at the bags under my eyes..  I didn't really realize it until I saw the photos.. Man I was tired.. I look aweful.. (More than normal..)\n\nI did finally get to ride the cherahala skyway on my motorcycle which is something that my folks have been after me to do for a while.  It's a very very pretty ride with tons of other bikers up there for the view and the fun of it..  Bikes of every kind going every which way up and down a very twisty road..\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2009/09/BaldRiverRoadSign.jpg\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Bald River Falls Road\" src=\"/images/2009/09/BaldRiverRoadSign-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Bald River Falls Road\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Bald River Falls Road</span></a>\n\nIt's just gorgeous..  My favorite area is the Bald River Falls area, which technically isn't on the skyway but rather a turn off of it.. its a nice long ride (18 miles or so) where you pretty much have a cliff face on one side with forest and what not, and a drop off on the other side with a river running down it..  No guard rails for most of it and the road gets down right narrow on a few parts of it..  People drive way too fast down that road, down all roads in TN to be honest..  I almost got ran off the road once when a pack of about 10 Honda S2000's zipped by me doing some sort of group run..\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2009/09/BaldRiverFalls.jpg\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"Bald River Falls (Large)\" src=\"/images/2009/09/BaldRiverFalls.jpg\" alt=\"Bald River Falls (Large)\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Bald River Falls (Large)</span></a>\n\nI stopped at Bald River Falls and took a bunch of photos, most of which came out nicely but you see one picture of forest you've seen them all..  The falls itself is very pretty.. The image I have included is a large picture for those that want to use it for something..\n\nI would have stayed out on the road longer and taken my time but it was raining.. You can't see it in the falls picture or the road picture, but it was down right wet..   The weather was the pits the whole time I was there..  It was always sprinkling at the very least or a full blown gully washer at one point..\n\nI spent time with dad talking about wood working and he showed me how to make a bowl (that was cool), but we got trapped out in his shop by the rain.  It was raining so hard while we were out there that we could pretty much just look at one another, the metal roof kept us from talking (or rather from being heard..)   but I got to see him rough out a bowl on his big lathe, that was pretty neat.  Ed took pictures of it and I hope to get them from him so I can post some.. it was an interesting process.. Makes me kind of want to try it..   I just don't have the lathe, or the money to get one..\n\nEventually I realized that I needed to ponder heading home..  My original plan was to wait until it stopped raining and drive home then.. Yeah its a week later, and its still raining up there..  One look at the forecast and I knew that the whole \"wait for the rain to stop\" plan wasn't going to work..\n\nSo I went the other route;  Take extra days getting home and go slow.  Motorcycles in the rain aren't nearly as bad as most people think..  Put on enough rain gear and you stay quite dry.. infact, I never got wet at all even though I drove through about 600 miles of wet weather..\n\nThe issue really is the water on the road and the big trucks..  You know how when you're driving down the road in your and there is a big puddle that you can't avoid, you throw up a bunch of water and kinda hydroplane for a few feet..   yeah that's bad on a bike.. Also the big trucks that throw a lot of spray, also bad but for different reasons.\n\nSo I intentionally left a day early with intent to take my time getting home..  And while the road was wet and it was raining nearly the whole first day, it wasn't bad at all..  I never felt in danger..\n\nThe first day I ended up driving 650 miles before I just had to stop..  I had to stop not because I was wet, or tired.. but because I was SORE!\n\nMy lower back was complaining loudly as were my knees..  Other than that I was fine.. I was in good spirits, I had my audio books and music to listen to and the bike was eating up the road like no tomorrow, but my back and knees were barkin' and I had to raise the white flag..\n\nI stayed at a motel on the side of the road (A days inn I believe it was) for the night and then started over again in the morning..  The next day it didn't rain a single drop and it was beautiful the whole time.. I got home faster than it took me to get there!\n\nOn the one hand I felt bad because I had left a day earlier than I had originally planned, but on the other I was glad to be home..  I missed Melissa and it was nice to come home and give her a hug.. (*shrug* She smells good..)\n\nI'm 100% thankful for the \"Throttle meister\" my motorcycle has.. The fellow who had the bike before me spent the extra $200 to put what amounts to a cruise control on the bike.. Thank god..  Holding the throttle open for over a thousand miles would have killed my hand.. Primarily because the throttle has a fairly stiff spring and is resisting being turned.. as it should..  The throttle meister basically holds the throttle open for you..\n\nThe second thing I'm thankful for is my bikes gas milage.  It cost me $58 to drive 1055 miles on my bike, and that's buying the expensive gas.. It cost almost that much for one tank full of the cheap stuff on the truck drive up there..\n\nAll in all it was a fantastic trip.. I very much enjoyed the time I spent with the folks while up there, and had a hell of a good time on the ride home..   My initial reaction upon getting home was to think; \"Dear god I'm not doing that again any time soon\".. primarily because I was sore..  But upon reflection, I was only sore for a day.. I would do that trip again..\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2009-08-24-back-from-blizzcon-2009.md","url":"/back-from-blizzcon-2009/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-08-24-back-from-blizzcon-2009.md","id":"/back-from-blizzcon-2009","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Back from Blizzcon 2009","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2009/08/blizzcon-logo.png","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-08-24 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"back-from-blizzcon-2009","ext":".md"},"url":"/1055-miles-on-two-wheels/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-09-25-1055-miles-on-two-wheels.md","id":"/1055-miles-on-two-wheels","collection":"posts","excerpt":"So my father turned 68 this year.  I thought it would be a nice gift to give him my tractor lawn mower and a few other items that I knew he could use that I simply no longer needed.   The main issue was getting the tractor to him..","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"1055 Miles, on two wheels","layout":"post","tags":["Roadtrip","Motorcycle"],"image":"/images/2009/09/Motorcycle-Pic-2.JPG","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-09-25 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"1055-miles-on-two-wheels","ext":".md"},"url":"/carl-sagan-a-glorious-dawn/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-09-28-carl-sagan-a-glorious-dawn.md","id":"/carl-sagan-a-glorious-dawn","collection":"posts","excerpt":"The following is a wonderful and fitting tribute to Carl Sagan created by John Boswell over at ColorPulse Music.","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Carl Sagan - A Glorious Dawn","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2009/09/carl.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-09-28 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"carl-sagan-a-glorious-dawn","ext":".md"},"url":"/hardware-review-logitech-illuminated-keyboard/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-10-01-hardware-review-logitech-illuminated-keyboard.md","id":"/hardware-review-logitech-illuminated-keyboard","collection":"posts","excerpt":"I have to admit I like Logitech.  Their hardware is always good.  I find their software is a little bloated and doesn't always deliver but I can't fault the hardware at all..","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Hardware Review: Logitech Illuminated Keyboard","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2009/10/logitech_illuminated_keyboard.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-10-01 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"hardware-review-logitech-illuminated-keyboard","ext":".md"}
