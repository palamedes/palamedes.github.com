I pride myself on beta testing just about every MMO that has ever been.. So I was a little sad when for whatever reason, the gods decided to not let me into the Age of Conan beta.  Eh, these things happen, however this meant I was pretty much slobbering at the bit waiting for access to the game. (I was one of the few that got into the paid early access for the game however, so that's close enough for me. )\n\nFirstly let me say, funcom has done a wonderful job capturing and portraying the world of Conan.. I'm having a lot of fun.\n\nHowever, I was initially worried.   I beta tested and played Anarchy Online and by all accounts it's initial release was a nightmare. It was truly, truly bad.  Funcom, and all other game companies for that matter, learned that day that to release a broken game dooms the game forever.  I had assumed that funcom learned its lesson and would release a stable game, in fact I had visions of board meetings in which the members all chanted, \"please not like AO\"... So you can imagine my shock when at 12pm my time, when the doors were to open.. Nothing happened.\n\nI refreshed the game a couple times and found out that it got pushed back to 3pm.  Fine fine.. understandable.. these things are complex..  So I played some Call of Duty 4 for a couple hours and dreamed of headchopping..   3pm came along and...   Nothing.  Plus, now the funcom forums have crashed due to a database error..\n\n\"Oh god..\" I cried, \"funcom is doing it again! Its Anarchy Online all over.. \"\n\nNow before you get disappointed, at 3:30pm the servers came online and I played for 12 hours straight.. but I get ahead of myself..\n\nAt this point the forums are coming up and down and having all manner of issues.  People are yammering away about lawsuits and making immature pointless complains.. (Seriously folks.. build a bridge and get over it.. )  Constant cries about how funcom has screwed the pooch!  About how players are going to sue, and about boycotting them, how this is the worse release ever (I WAY disagree)..etc.  (it was really lame.. I hope funcom knows that the vocal and annoying minority are just a bunch of douche bags that don't represent the rest of us.)\n\nThe game isn't actually to be released until the 20th.. so at this point the game isn't much more than a paid beta..  I'm not sure what people were/are complaining about.\n\nOnce the game did finally go live for those of us in the Early Access program at around 3:30 I jumped in and made 4 characters to get my commonly used names.  I then played the game as my ranger for the next 12 hours!\n\nSeriously.. 12 hours.. straight..   I got my character to level 17, and at around 4 am I went to bed..\n\nI had my graphics set to max and played without a hiccup or a glitch until around 6 hours in when my frame rate went into the toilet.   I relogged, and went right back at it. So they have a very minor memory leak most likely.. but hell if thats the worst of it.. YAY US!\n\nSeriously, what a fantastic game.  Funcom has done a marvelous job here folks.   Those who are saying this release was a bad one.. A) You're retarded -- the game isn't out yet.  That happens on the 20th in the US and the 23rd in Europe (Sucks.. sorry about that guys)..  B) this has been the cleanest deployment I've ever seen and I have played a lot of games of this nature.\n\nI think funcom has done a very good job.  Now I'll admit there is still ample time for them to screw it up between now and release, but so far so good.\n\n__Major game issues__:\n\n* In the 14 or so hours total that I have played the game at this point, I have only had one blue screen of death.  The game was running smoothly then the sound locks up, BSoD and auto-reboot.  No idea why it happened.  *shrug*  Could have been anything, so I am not even sure if it was the game.  It could have just as easily been the Microsoft auto updater which has caused me issues before and was demanding I install something upon reboot.\n\n__Minor game issues__:\n\n* After 8 hours of game play my frame rate tanked -- which of course just required me to re-log and all was well.  I class this as a minor issue because there was an easy fix.  Most likely it was a memory leak issue somewhere..\n* Climbing interface needs work -- you just kind of pop onto a ladder and then pop off of it.  Plus if you have multiple climbable surfaces near one another the game often gets confused as to which one you actually want to climb.\n* Mob AI is kinda weak -- when sneaking through the keep to steal the phoenix medallion often you must dispatch some troublesome guards.  Typically I wait for one to be alone, then kill him.  Wait for the next one to path along, then kill him.  Etc..  It amuses me that often one mob will path over the body of his fallen comrade without a care in the world.  I expect this behavour out of unintelligent mobs.. but not guards..\n* Grouping Colors -- by default player names are turned off..  To include those in your group!  I want to be able to see my group mates easily and can't do that in a pack of mobs.  Give us an option to show just our group mate names and make the icons for group members bigger on the mini map please.\n* First Person Shooting -- why does it take me from first person shooting to an over the shoulder view then back after combat?  this confuses me.. and frankly I hate it.\n* Range First/Third Person difference -- why does my bow have a different range depending on my view?  that's retarded.\n\nRequests:\n\n* I want a way to set a view preset for each of my weapon sets.  You have two weapon sets that you can swap between, I want my view to be able to swap too!  First person for bows, third person for swords.  Should be simple.\n* My bows range should be the same no matter what view I'm in.  Its really lame that they are different.  Both third person and first person should work as first person currently does.  If I miss, then I miss.  Don't tell me I'm out of range though.. thats really dumb.\n\nmore as I think of them...\n","collection":"posts","url":"/by-crom-its-age-of-conan/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2008-06-02-its-been-a-year-already.md","collection":"posts","url":"/its-been-a-year-already/","path":"_posts/2008-06-02-its-been-a-year-already.md","id":"/its-been-a-year-already","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"It's been a year already?!","layout":"post","tags":["Marriage"],"image":"/images/2008/06/samecards.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-06-02 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"its-been-a-year-already","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2008-05-18-by-crom-its-age-of-conan.md","excerpt":"It's interesting..

A whole year has gone by in the blink of an eye! It must be magic, cause it really went by fast and everything is still peachy.. More over, for our anniversary gifts to one another we both managed to get the same card, from different stores.. in different cities.. heh\n\nEither we are perfect for one another or both of these stores need a better stock of cards.. heh Considering the vast number that were at my store, I choose the \"we are perfect for one another\" option.\n\nFor our anniversary I got her dough nuts, and we had fishsticks.. Er.. okay kidding about the fishsticks.. Not the dough nuts.. heh.. It's sort of an inside joke, but the long and short of it is; we stayed up until 4am and I got up at 7am and got her her favorite dough nuts.. I was punch drink and woosey while driving the 30 minutes to and from the store..\n\nFor dinner we went to <a href=\"http://www.fogodechao.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Fogo de Chão</a> (fo-go dèe shoun) in downtown Austin.. This restaurant is fantastic! They stuff you full of meat, and then when you cant possibly hold any more, they shove in an extra hand full and call it \"dessert\". Seriously, the chef's walk around with large spits of meat and cut you off a slice as they walk by. It was great! Pricey as all hell, but damn good.\n\n<a title=\"Cheese Cake and Flan\" rel='lightbox' href='/images/2008/06/cheesecakeandflan.jpg' class='fancybox pull-left'><img src=\"/images/2008/06/cheesecakeandflan-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Cheese Cake and Flan\" /></a>\n\nAnd, whats more .. even with as much beef, lamb, chicken, and .. god any other animal you care to mention in our stomach's my lovely and skinny wife still managed to skoff down some cheesecake! I had the flan.. =) it was yummy.\n\nAfterwards Mel and I both had meat hangovers for a couple days.. heh\n","collection":"posts","url":"/its-been-a-year-already/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2008-06-02-its-been-a-year-already.md","collection":"posts","url":"/its-been-a-year-already/","path":"_posts/2008-06-02-its-been-a-year-already.md","id":"/its-been-a-year-already","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"It's been a year already?!","layout":"post","tags":["Marriage"],"image":"/images/2008/06/samecards.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-06-02 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"its-been-a-year-already","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2008-06-12-3g-iphone.md","content":"<img class=\"pull-right\" title=\"3G Iphone\" src=\"/images/2008/06/3giphone-150x150.png\" alt=\"3G Iphone Hotness\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" />\n\nThere is no two ways about it, <a title=\"Wikipedia Link\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_jobs\" target=\"_blank\">Steve Jobs</a> is a pretty smart fellow, and the latest iPhone hotness just proves it.\n\nLets be completely honest here, the hardware upgrades aren't that great though.

I have no need of that tool.

'07 just for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect\">Mass Effect</a>.. but damn I came close..\n\nThis game looked awesome!  Everyone that played it said it was awesome and that I should rush out and get a console to play it -- so needless to say I was really annoyed that it wasn't a PC game and even more annoyed at folks telling me to buy a console.. But I was very excited when I heard it was eventually coming to the PC!\n\nWhen it hit the shelves for the PC back in May I pretty much went and got it as soon as I could.  (I was a couple days late, but a funeral will do that.. )\n\nWhat an absolutely fantastic game! I maintain that Bioware is an awesome company and that they do good work. I have liked just about all of their games; Baldur's gate was fun, BG2 of course was a good game, Neverwinter nights was well done, but had issues. And of course KotOR was fantastic.  So I knew when I heard that Mass Effect was being put out by these guys, it was going to be a rockin game.  Oh how right I was..\n\nThe game is so polished!  I mean from character creation all the way through the end of the game, it just feels right, and works.   Everything works!  It is the closest thing to \"playing a movie\" that I have ever experienced.\n\nWhat I love about it is that you can play the game differently multiple times through, choosing a different class, past, powers, weapons, armors, friends, missions, assignments, personality..etc.. and play the same game in a completely different way!\n\nAnd whats awesome is, the game will play right along.  The voice over actors will actually do different dialogs depending on your past history, your past actions, your current actions, and will correctly label you if you're male or female!  I really hope they got their money back on the sheer volume of voice acting they had to supply this sucker!\n\nI can't say enough good things about this game.. I want to salute Bioware!  And to think they are currently working on Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3!! *GLEE*  (though probably for the consoles first.. *grumble*)\n\nI read quite a few posts about the game too and the biggest complaint is that it was short.  Which boggles my mind.  The first play through took me 25+ hours, and I didn't do everything.  There was still quite a lot of content that I didn't do.. (I initiated the final end game mission without really realizing that was what I was doing.. but then.. I'm st00pid..)\n\n25+ hours of game play, especially for a game you can play again in so many different ways, seems very reasonable.   I mean other games of this nature didn't have that much content..  Plus they are talking about releasing future downloadable content?  Seriously..\n\nThis game very much rules..  In all likelihood you should get it...\n","collection":"posts","url":"/mass-effect/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2008-06-13-mass-effect.md","collection":"posts","url":"/mass-effect/","path":"_posts/2008-06-13-mass-effect.md","id":"/mass-effect","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Mass Effect","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2008/06/256px-masseffect_box_cover-150x150.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-06-13 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"mass-effect","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2008-06-14-assassins-creed.md","content":"<img class=\"pull-right\" title=\"Assassins Creed\" src=\"/images/2008/06/256px-assassins_creed-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\nAnother console to PC port that's been out since April, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassins_creed\" target=\"_blank\">Assassins Creed</a> is a third person sneaker created by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubisoft\" target=\"_blank\">Ubisoft</a> in which the player repeatedly delves into his genetic memory in order to assume the role of a 12th century assassin trying to kill various historical figures during the crusades in the holy land.\n\nSimply put, this is a very impressive game -- Not perfect, but worth the purchase.  To be honest I'm not sure why I waited as long as I did.  The game itself is quite beautiful and has a very nice story line.  It's the first game in a while that I would classify as \"smart\" and clever at every stage -- taking quite a step away from your usual brute force or shoot'em up games.  Stealth in this game is everything.\n\nThe player must use all manner of stealthy game mechanics like eavesdropping,  pickpocketing, and assassination in order to complete the missions.  Running in swinging your sword to just kill everything simply wont work, and while you're not nurfed like you were in Thief, you still can't take the overwhelming odds that you'll encounter if you try to hack your way through.\n\nThe game mechanics are excellent as anything you walk at, run at or into, jump at/on/over will cause your character to behave exactly as you'd expect him to.  The \"oh wow\" moment for me was early on when I jumped and landed on a short platform and went a little too far.  The character hit the edge and flailed trying to regain his balance.  It looked very convincing.  The climbing mechanic is extremely well done, and you'll use it pretty much constantly.\n\nYour character is extremely athletic, probably unreasonably so heh.  I wish I could hang by my finger tips for an hour while my player went to the store for a coke..  And while jumping off the tower into the cart looks keen and all,  that'd kill the hell out of you!\n\nI did find some issues with the game;\n\nJumping into water .. KILLS YOU!  heh, harsh.  But then I guess this is a desert memory and he can't swim.\n\nI'm not sure how slowing down and ducking your head makes you less conspicuous.. but.. it does.  This really is the only mechanic I don't understand, but then how else would you provide a button that allows you to \"fly casual\".\n\nControls are extremely unintuitive and border on confusing.  Especially for a PC gamer who doesn't play console games.  You can really tell that this is a console game that was ported to PC where the controls are concerned.. The main issue is there is a LOT of things you can do and they try to do all of them with some combination of 4 buttons.\n\nWhile the controls for the game are unintuitive and confusing, they give you quite a lot of options both in and out of combat.  And I don't care who you are, sneaking up to an archer on the top of a building and pushing him off to watch him fall to his death is good wholesome fun.  You will eventually realize that you can be extremely \"loose\" with controlling your character and he'll usually behave the way you wanted.\n\nThis is something that most PC players will have a hard time with simply because they are used to micro-managing their characters, as opposed to console games which will partly play themselves.\n\nThe graphics engine seems a tad unoptimized as I get a solid 60fps (with vsync) but there is video lag and jumpiness.. Also the game is beautiful, yet it has no ingame option for anti-aliasing.  This is a common trend of game makers lately and it boggles the mind.  Games with AA look so much better than without, but most of them don't use AA.  It saddens me.  Forcing AA through the control panel has odd and unplayable results.\n\nThat's really it.    Most of my complaints are pretty minor.  The game is a lot of fun and most likely will be one that I finish.  (For me that's a sign of a good game.)\n\nOh and Chad, my computer gets a solid 60fps in most places though in a couple of the way up high views were you see everything, it dips into the 50s.  =)   Max graphics baby!   *sniff* I love my computer..\n","collection":"posts","url":"/assassins-creed/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2008-06-15-age-of-conan-annoys-me.md","collection":"posts","url":"/age-of-conan-annoys-me/","path":"_posts/2008-06-15-age-of-conan-annoys-me.md","id":"/age-of-conan-annoys-me","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Age of Conan is beginning to annoy me","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2008/06/age_of_conan_cover.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-06-15 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"age-of-conan-annoys-me","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2008-06-14-assassins-creed.md","excerpt":"Another console to PC port that's been out since April, Assassins Creed is a third person sneaker created by Ubisoft in which the player repeatedly delves into his genetic memory in order to assume the role of a 12th century assassin...","id":"/assassins-creed","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Assassins Creed","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2008/06/256px-assassins_creed.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-06-14 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"assassins-creed","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2008-06-13-mass-effect.md","excerpt":"This game looked awesome!
