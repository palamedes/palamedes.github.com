And in 2018, the gap between the two extremes is way larger.  The rich are massively richer, where as the wage earners are at the same place.   \n \nAs if to say we needed to do something to help those poor people who do all the work!  Of course, all the while their talking positions and language was laced with self-aggrandizing pity and self-interest for the need to give the poor (that they self identified as) free shit! (read: take money away from the greedy rich whom obviously dont deserve it.)\n\nTo which I said;  Or, you could just do what the \"rich\" have done and stop working for \"the man\" and take some risks.  Start a business!  TRY!  Put yourself out there!  How do you think the rich became rich in the first place?!  Risk takers get rich and deserve the lion share of the profits because of said risk, the wage earner will never be rich.\n\nHoly shit.. You'd think I pissed in their cereal.  All of them suddenly had the look on their face like they tasted butt.. Uh oh.. I just became public enemy number one by upsetting the proletariat and not towing the \"give me free shit\" line.\n\nI love how \"the rich\" are always defined as some nebulous group of greedy people at the top that like to keep people under their boot and horde all the money.  And I routinely get ostracized as a heretical pariah or at the least persona non grata when I suggest that, No, they are people just like you and I that actually took a risk!  \n\nStatistically I have no idea if the gap is that much greater now than it was in 1990..  But if you expect to keep doing the working day grind and suddenly get rich then you're in for a shock.  More over, there's this radical notion that people who earned money by taking the risk to get it, shouldn't be allowed to keep what they earned and some how they are being greedy for wanting to.. uh.. wut?\n\nI just don't get it.. \n\nIf you're not willing to try, if you're not willing to risk.. then you don't deserve the reward.  You don't get to bemoan your lot in life if you aren't willing to do anything to change it.   How is this even a discussion?!  \n\nThe biggest risk in life is to take no risk at all, if you're not courageous enough to try to excel then you need to accept being ordinary.\n\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2018-04-20-site-redesign-and-restlessness.md","url":"/site-redesign-and-restlessness/","relative_path":"_posts/2018-04-20-site-redesign-and-restlessness.md","id":"/site-redesign-and-restlessness","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Software Development"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Site Redesign and Restlessness","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2018/site-redesign.jpg","gallery":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"tile_class":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"duration":null,"costs":null,"date":"2018-04-20 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"site-redesign-and-restlessness","ext":".md"},"url":"/i-want-to-be-rich/","relative_path":"_posts/2018-04-25-i-want-to-be-rich.md","id":"/i-want-to-be-rich","collection":"posts","excerpt":"There's this radical notion that people who earned money by taking the risk to get it, shouldn't be allowed to keep what they earned and some how they are being greedy for wanting to.. uh.. wut?","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"I want to be rich!

Life continues apace and I continue to ignore my blog / diary.  I realize now that this blog is nothing more than a modern diary, and not really anything else.  I treat it as such anyway.\n\nI really want to do so many things here though.  Back in the day I made these really cool and clever animated sites and I loved it but I got away with that and have been boring ever since.  I still want to do those things.. I liked doing all that 3D work and enjoyed making those cool sites but wow the time it took was pretty vast and now that I'm older I have so many other things I could be doing haha. \n\nHaving said that,  I get this creative restlessness that makes me want to do something... ANYTHING! but then I realize I have zero creativity and am not able to come up with anything and it eats at me..  There are days that I'm pretty unpleasant to be around simply because I have this ball of angst in the pit of my stomach because I feel like I need to create.. and can't.    I have to settle for doing something less useful and less creative just to get something done.  Like, writing an entry.. or fixing a link or updating a footer ..etc.. \n\nEven then I screw things up.  Like the pagination on my blog is broken.  If you go to the end there are several \"pages\" that are empty.. bleh.\nI have been meaning to turn this whole thing into a static JSON site but haven't gotten around to it.  Again, no time, no creative juices, too much other shit going on.  I will fix it eventually.\n\nI tried ot update to the latest version of Jekyll and .. wow.. Broke the world!  Reverted that until I can figure out why literally EVERYTHING is broken.\n\nI really like the idea of making the entire site work like a windows desktop that would allow me to plant easter eggs and games.. etc.. I still want to make a game.. SO MUCH WANT TO MAKE A GAME!\n\nHell I even want to recreate Zork or Adventure or other text games in the site just for funzies.  I thought about trying to make a static blog / json M.U.D. just to see if I could.   I thought about it long and hard and I actually think I could pull it off with sockets and clever JSON design.  Maybe one day.  Maybe it's here already and you just haven't figured out how to lauch it yet. \n\nMy plane continues going and I recently ordered the fuselage so that's cool.  I get to build more and more!  yay!  plus it's cool having folks watch me.  I dunno why that keeps me motivated but it does.   \n\nI got a really nice trailer for $600!  Super excited about that.  I needed a way to transport things now that I have a jeep instead of a truck and getting a trailer made sense.  But the trailer I wanted was over a thousand dollars.  In fact, it was listed Lowes website for $1499.   I went to lowes to look at it and it was on sale.. for $599.   It was clearly mismarked, and in a line of other smaller trailers that were obviously the $599 trailers, but this one had the $599 sticker on it.  I asked the guy about it and he said, yeah that was correct.  I asked if he was sure, and he said yes.\n\nThe same trailer was in another row marked to $1299 so I'm just about 100% sure this thing was mismarked.. I'm not complaining.  Sometimes you win!  I tried to do the right thing and it paid off. \n \nNot sure how I'm going to afford the engine for the plane yet... if someone wants to fund my plane let me know =)\n\nOkay back to the grind.  I have been writing some software for my wifes work and it's taking all my time.  I have put a LOT of time into it so far and I have a long way to go.

Time for me to talk about how I never post any more and how I have no time.  Life is super busy, I'm doing too many things, I need to find time..etc.. \n\nFeh.. These are all lies.  Mostly, I think I'm just really wanting to do something else..  I get into these weird moods where nothing is right and everything looks old/boring..etc.  Really this is just an excuse and a sign that something larger is at issue.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm still going to ponder redoing this site.. 'cause that's the kind of brain damaged I am but a lot more is going on.  \n\nA couple months ago I sold off my half of my ownership in a software company and honestly, it was past time.   In a weird way I'm still coming to terms with it, but mostly because I still don't know what I want to be when I grow up. \n\nWhen you have worked in software for over twenty years, it's hard to do something else.   A clean break seems impossible, but at the same time seems like the only way to move forward.  \n\nGrok was great and it was a good experience over all but I want to do my own thing, and I want to do other things.   I got into software professionally in the early 1990's and almost did it on a lark.  Originally programming was a hobby that was all funzies and joy..  The important lesson I learned was, once you turn a hobby into a career, you lose the hobby and it becomes work.\n\nI'm to the point now that the notion of going back into software as a professional developer (even as an individual contributor instead of management) is completely distasteful.  Sure the money is great, but the level of anxiety and sense of misery is palpable.  I just can't bring myself to do it. \n\nI still like the idea of writing my own software and doing something very passively that might make money or might not just as an \"out\" or as something fun to do in my spare time though.  Very much back to my original \"hobby\" status with programming.  But professionally?  Nope.  I think I'm done there.\n\nI've pondered doing some stuff with the airplane build that makes it more of a tutorial site where others can comment and give input on how to build a plane.  Sort of a community documentation site.  I have to ponder this.  But the idea would be to make it so that each step in the plans would be it's own page with a video or documentation on how to do the work.  Almost an interactive crowd sourced project where people can talk / discuss and even comment directly on the plans and steps in a virtual space.   I have reached out to Scott Risan at Van's Aircraft to see if this is something they would support or veto.  No response yet. \n\nI'm going to make a video to my patreons about this and see what they think.\n\n### Other things on my list of \"shit to do\";\n\n_I want to redesign the blog_ \nBut not necessarily a full visual redesign, but more of a \"bring it up to currency\" with regards to be backend deployment software.  It's been ages since I have updated my Jekyll install and I'm STILL using LESS.

They color it by saying it's \"Democratic Socialism\" (\"DS\" going forward) which is sorta the same thing and not good -- Bear with me here.  \n\nTrue democratic socialists believe that a socialist state can be achieved through democratic means.  I don't believe that's what these folks are going for.  It would be far better for these people to refer to themselves as Social Democrats because then at least that says they aim to modify the harshness of capitalism with the infusion of some elements of socialism which I believe to be closer to their true aim.   But so far all of the millennials I have talked to that are pro the \"DS\" idea's call themselves democratic socialists, not social democrats.

That’s a good thing.  I know a lot of people my age, who at your age had no political views what-so-ever and happily let the government do whatever it wanted.  You're not doing that.  Good for you!  Take a stand in what you believe in.. Hell yeah.. that’s what America is all about!  I very much appreciate your attempts to better the country where my generation was a little less caring about it. \n\nHaving said that, in my opinion, there is a distinct dichotomy between being for \"DS\" but against the government doing something it feels is in your best interest. I'm specifically referring to the FBI wanting to add backdoors to iphones \"for your own good\".  It's good they oppose that, but it seems to be a direct contradiction to the \"DS\" mentality -- but that's an aside.\n\n## \"Democracy is the road to Socialism\"&#185;\n\nI'd also like to point out that the United States of America isn't a democracy.  We live in a constitutional republic, and while the line between democracy and republic is a fine one -- it's an important one.  Primarily because a constitutional republic is the road to freedom, and a democracy is the road to socialism.  \n\nSo with that, I have some serious concerns with “Democratic Socialism”.  Mostly that by its very nature it imbues the government with MORE power.  It strikes me as away by the citizens to eschew responsibility to the government and basically implies that you trust the government to take care of your needs.   History is replete with examples of why this is a bad idea.\n\n## \"The road to Hell is paved with good intentions\"&#178;\n\nDemocratic Socialism is a white wash of socialism.  Most non-democratic societies love to throw the word “democratic” into the language to describe what they are doing just to muddy the water, to confused and befuddle the proletariat into thinking that they had some choice or input on the matter.  They often don't.   I mean what exactly is democratic about the DPRK?  \n    \n## \"Men make their own history, but they do not make it as they please\"&#179;\n    \nAs to the United States; it really seems like people have forgotten that the US government has a primary job of national defense.   Giving the government more and more power, which is what democratic socialists are trying to do, will only encourage the tyrannical shift that many governments in the past have made.  History doomed to repeat itself.  \n\n<hr />\n\n<img src='/images/2016/dangers-socialism.png' class='left' />\n### Dangers of Socialism\n\n\"DS\" or just Socialism in general has a lot of dangers to it;\n  \n#### It rewards people for being irresponsible, indolent and for being unaccountable for their own actions\n\nIn an environment where you aren't responsible to produce, what stops you from being a complete lazy slob that can just hold your hand out and demand compensation?  Nothing.  In this environment people will demand more and more for doing less and less.  We already see this today and it will only get worse. \n\nThis system actively rewards people for being indolent and promotes indolence by de-incentivizing, robbing of initiative, drive and ambition those that produce anything because they have the fruits of their labor effectively stolen from them to perpetuate those that don’t.  \"DS\" not only allows for and legalizes theft but actively promotes it in the name of redistributing wealth.\n\n\n#### It de-incentivizes those that do produce, robbing them of not only the fruits of their labor but the initiative to produce in the first place\n\nThose that do produce things will be less and less likely to do so over time because they will see the individual who did nothing rewarded for doing nothing with the very fruits the producer should have gotten.  The notion that people will continue to produce happily for the sake of production is a flawed one due to the nature of Humans.  The Mark 1.0 Human being simply doesn't work that way.\n\n\n#### It rationalizes theft, penalizes accomplishment and does away with individual rights for the sake of the \"public good\"\n\nIf you're taking away from the person who produced in order to give it to the person who didn't, then you're not only penalizing the producer and de-incentivizing that production, but you're stealing from that individual who produced to give to those that didn't.   You can't encourage people to do more by first stealing from them.  You can't multiply production by first dividing it.  And you can't encourage those who do nothing to start being a productive member of society if you are giving them hand outs.  Again, Human nature.\n\nThis means that it completely undermines any spirit of entrepreneurship, innovation and competitiveness and actively promotes totalitarianism by encouraging people to be self-indulgent instead of self reliant.\n   \nThis also means that the rights of the worker will go out the window in favor of the public good and control by the state.\n\n#### It actively promotes obedience to the state, idealizes state power and encourages dependence on the state\n\nThis is where the real issue is;  The more the government squeezes and takes with intent to distribute to those who don't have, the more people will become dependant on that handout.   The more we go down the \"DS\" hole, the deeper people will get and the more people will rely on the government.  It’s a vicious cycle.  Think of where that will end..  By it’s very nature it can’t stop with just social programs like people think.  \n\nThe “democratic” aspect of it means people are willingly giving their own freedoms up without fully exploring where this could go.\n\n\n### But the Scandinavian democratic socialists managed it!\n\nmmmm, no they didn't.  \n\n_“I know that some people in the US associate the Nordic model with some sort of socialism. Therefore I would like to make one thing clear. Denmark is far from a socialist planned economy. Denmark is a market economy.”_  -- Prime Minister of Denmark at a speech at the Harvard Institute of Politics.\n\nCountries that already do this are pure consumer economies some with over 50% unemployment and over 80% taxation.\n\n## To sum up with Pro's and Con's\n\nWhat would it mean for a true socialist democratic solution in the US?\n\n## Con's:\n - Taxes would go up - A lot to cover all the new spending\n - Unemployment would go up - A lot because people don't have to work\n - Productivity would go down - A lot because people will be de-incentivized\n - People would be reliant on the government\n - Gives government much more (if not full) control\n - Rights of workers go out the window\n \n## Pro's:\n - Income inequality would go down - Unfair to those who product\n - Free benefits would go up - Not really free at all due to high taxes\n - Promotes a classless society - Rich and Poor gap will narrow drastically, again unfair to those who produced and earned\n\n&#185;,&#178;,&#179; : Finally, if you agree with any of the quoted headers above then you agree with Carl Marx and his Communist Manifesto as they are direct quotes from the man -- this would be a good time to rethink your position.  National Socialism (Hitler), Marxist Socialism (Communism), and Democratic Socialism are different, but not vastly so.  More over \"DS\" can include forms of Marxism and even Anarchism.  I feel modern pro \"DS\" individuals are taking more of a Marxist tack than they realize.\n\nAlso, keep in mind, governments ultimately enforce everything with a gun.  I feel that this socialism road people are trying to take us down will have a very bad ending...\n\n<hr/>\n\nAdditional -- I think this is a pretty good viewing and worth watching all of it: \n\n<iframe width=\"920\" height=\"540\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/D0Yp1jUtcX8\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","previous":{"path":"_posts/2015-08-18-livable-wages-unreasonable-expectations.md","url":"/livable-wages-unreasonable-expectations/","relative_path":"_posts/2015-08-18-livable-wages-unreasonable-expectations.md","id":"/livable-wages-unreasonable-expectations","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Software Development"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Livable Wages and Unreasonable Client Expectations","layout":"post","tags":["Business"],"image":"/images/2015/08/greed.jpg","gallery":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"tile_class":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"duration":null,"costs":null,"date":"2015-08-18 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"livable-wages-unreasonable-expectations","ext":".md"},"url":"/democratic-socialism/","relative_path":"_posts/2016-02-29-democratic-socialism.md","id":"/democratic-socialism","collection":"posts","excerpt":"I feel that this socialism road people are trying to take us down will have a very bad ending...","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Democratic Socialism","layout":"post","tags":["Democratic Socialism"],"image":"/images/2016/socialism.png","gallery":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"tile_class":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"duration":null,"costs":null,"date":"2016-02-29 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"democratic-socialism","ext":".md"},"url":"/out-of-time/","relative_path":"_posts/2016-12-01-out-of-time.md","id":"/out-of-time","collection":"posts","excerpt":"Well, it's that time again.
