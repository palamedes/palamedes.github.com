It was quite possibly one of the best 3 hour games I have ever played.. I mean, it was absolutely genius..  It a first person physics puzzle that walked this amazingly fine line of comedic darkness that kept you thinking, and laughing..\n\nThe only negative feedback anyone ever was able to come up with was how short it was.. When I say its a 3 hour game.. I mean it, it's a 3 hour game..  Even going slow you should be able to solve it in that amount of time..  You can eek out a couple extra hours of fun by doing the bonus levels or trying to get all the achievements but that's really it..\n\nThat was a tad disappointing, but Valve knew they were on to something and started working on the next installment almost immediately..\n\nAnd I have to say, holy crap.. it looks amazing..  Check out all the videos over at <a href=\"http://thinkwithportals.com/\" target=\"_blank\">http://thinkwithportals.com/</a>\n\nI couldn't help but sit here giggling with the pure liquid awesomeness that is the coming game.. It looks so good!   I got so excited I played through the first game again..\n\nAnd btw, if you haven't played Portal yet.. You should.. It costs $19 on Steam and is worth every penny!  yes it's only a 3 hour game, but still it's so fun you'll likely play it several times..

The simply truth is that one vote has no value and I can prove it to you;\n\nIf my vote is such a big deal I'll tell ya what, I'll sell you my vote.   I'm pretty sure I can get a mail ballot and send it to you so that you can vote as me..  You can vote for anything you want..  That's pretty cool right?  Suddenly you could double your voting potential!\n\nHow much is my vote worth to you?  How much money are you willing to send to me in order to get this \"precious commodity\"?   yeah I thought so..\n\nUltimately though, it's my right.  I served in the US Army and after words as a Police Officer to ensure your freedoms and mine.  I choose, to not choose.\n","collection":"posts","url":"/i-dont-vote/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2010-11-02-i-dont-vote.md","collection":"posts","url":"/i-dont-vote/","path":"_posts/2010-11-02-i-dont-vote.md","id":"/i-dont-vote","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"I don't vote...","layout":"post","tags":["Voting"],"image":"/images/2010/11/votingprocess.jpg","ribbon":null,"tile_size":"2x2","private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2010-11-02 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"i-dont-vote","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2010-11-05-game-review-star-wars-the-force-unleashed-2.md","content":"<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2010/11/tfu2_dated.jpg\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"FU2\" src=\"/images/2010/11/tfu2_dated-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"FU2\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>FU Again er 2... </span></a>\n\nI never played the first Force Unleashed game and I sorta regretted it as I knew several folks who said it was a pretty good game..  So I was really excited when they announced a Force Unleashed 2 for the PC.    I figured that I'd finally get to try what everyone was talking about..\n\nWell I've tried it..  What a piece of shit..  This is quite honestly the first game that has pissed me off in a long time..  And I mean absolutely barking at the computer, pissed off..\n\nSo lets give the pros;\n\nIt's beautiful..  The graphics engine that they have used is a very nice one and it does a really good job of immersing you into the Star Wars universe..\n\nPlus it's a console to PC port so the expected controls are pretty bad, but I have seen worse console ports in this department so I want to give them a thumbs up here..

At this point the PC version of the latest game is completely unplayable by a large portion of the market, myself included and some how that seems okay to them.\n\nIt really seems the zero day patch system that just about all software manufacturers use is starting to get out of hand..  Whats that you ask?   Well it goes something like this;  Marketing and business have the game release date firmly set because that's what they have promised share holders.    This is a firm date and it can't move.   Period.\n\nProduct architects and management continue to shoe-horn in last minute features that they think would be cool or because users want them or because they fit some \"vision\", and expect that date they set above to not slip at all..    So it's up to the developers to squeeze out the product in a completely unreasonable amount of time..\n\nPrior to that magical date, there is another magical date when the product goes gold.. At gold (or dcut or whatever they call it) they cut a copy of the program and send it to test.  If it passes the most basic of verification tests they go on and send it to print where it gets put to disks and / or packaged up to be shipped to the user.\n\nTest continues to file defects and report problems to the developers and the developers are still working to fix those bugs..  But everyone knows that the software is full of bugs when it first goes gold and gets shipped to the customer..  Management and Marketing accepts this as \"how it is\", and usually fails to tell the shareholders it works this way..  So they are fully aware of how broken the product is, in order to meet that magical ship date..\n\nThey are just hoping like hell that once the game is installed it will automatically download the latest patch (the zero day patch) which will fix all the bugs that the game shipped with..\n\nBut that begs the question;  What happens when you willingly and knowingly ship a broken product hoping for that zero day patch, but that zero day patch isn't ready in time?  Or the zero day patch doesn't do anything to address the issues people are seeing?\n\nThis is whats going on with black ops..  There was a zero day patch (shocker) and it didn't do anything that I can tell, or at the very best brought it from a completely broken state to now just an unreasonably broken state for a game we paid $60 in order to play..\n\nThe real pisser is that companies know that we have zero recourse..  We have no way to get that money back..  I paid for a game, and it doesn't work.. and I have no recourse..   Imagine if you purchased a toaster from walmart and it just didn't do anything.. you could take it back, and have a reasonable expectation of getting your money back.   Not here;  And they know it..  They bank on it..\n\nBottom line is the game is broken for a large number of folks and they don't care.. One of the devs via his twitter account stated as much..  Instead talking about the 85k people playing right at that moment..\n\nAs of Nov 2009 the call of duty franchise sold more than 55 million units, and they think just because a paltry 85k can play the game it's okay?   Plus they have no idea how well those 85k are able to play.. I can play the game for a few minutes here and there, but it crashes or lags to a stop..etc.. Sure I was playing it but it wasn't playable.. Am I one of those 85k they are so proud of?\n\nSingle player gets laggy and stuttery while playing it but usually it's still somewhat playable, frustrating as hell, but playable.. where as multiplayer is so bad it's completely not worth trying to play..\n\nI was able to get the game to play once I turned all graphics to the minimum settings, lowered the screen resolution to something ridiculously low, and played it in a window..  THEN it's \"playable\" (I use the term loosely)..  My CPU is still hammered though..  My GPU is bored when I do this.. It almost acts like they aren't using GPU acceleration maybe?   I really don't know..\n\nThe game is unreasonably broken..  It's 100% CPU bound in that they  did virtually zero optimization on the code or left the debug code going  or aren't using GPU acceleration or something..  My quad core pegs all 4 cores to 100% while playing and  my machine while older is no slouch..\n\nIt often loses save games just out of the blue.. I got half way through the game, went to get something to eat.. came back to continue after having continued before only to have a \"New Campaign\" option.. My resume game options were all gone..  So great.. I got half way through to have to go half way through again?!  Fuck that..  This is the point when I started to fight with multiplayer..\n\nThe servers list is completely broken in multiplayer in that it often doesn't update.. or refuses to stop updating once it starts.. or you can't connect to a server at all.. or it doesn't even try to connect..\n\nOnce connected it stutters to a stop constantly.. Not network lag either this is an internal lockup of some sort.. My ping usually doesn't go above 50..  DirectX crashes, random crashes to desktop, jerky stuttery video.. etc..  It's just unplayable and not fun..\n\nIt's also pretty clear to  me that even though they list a minimum spec computer that can run the  game, they never actually tried that themselves as a lot of folks on the  forums who don't have the latest Intel i7 QuadCore Super Rig simply  can't play it..\n\nUltimately, I'm severely disappointed..  I really expected a hell of a lot more out of them..\n\nI can play COD:World at War on max graphics using my one graphics card to span 3 monitors and it works fine.. Yet this game wont work at all on the same PC?   It's not my machine..\n\nAnd by their responses, I guess COD is no longer the franchise for me..  I can't recommend this game at all.. It gets zero stars and isn't worth your money, your time, or your frustration..\n\n*EDIT:  Okay so on a whim I completely reinstalled windows from the ground up the same day that they released a new patch for the game..  Now the game is playable..  I can't actually say if it was due to the windows reinstall, the patch or both.. *\n\n*I have been playing a lot of multiplayer and I can say its not bad but still has a lot of issues which makes me think the original issue was the game not my machine..  I still get a lot of stuttering with the game as well as the crashes..  The server list is still completely borked, and server hangups/crashes seem constant too which tells me the game still needs more patching before it's good to go.. *\n\n*I'd still recommend waiting.. *\n","collection":"posts","url":"/game-review-call-of-duty-black-ops/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2010-11-13-game-review-call-of-duty-black-ops.md","collection":"posts","url":"/game-review-call-of-duty-black-ops/","path":"_posts/2010-11-13-game-review-call-of-duty-black-ops.md","id":"/game-review-call-of-duty-black-ops","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Game Review: Call of Duty Black Ops","layout":"post","tags":["Call of Duty","Review"],"image":"/images/2010/11/Black-Ops.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2010-11-13 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"game-review-call-of-duty-black-ops","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2010-11-14-40k-grot-tanks.md","content":"<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2010/11/gtp34.jpg\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Simple Grot Tank\" src=\"/images/2010/11/gtp34-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Simple Grot Tank\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Simple Grot Tank</span></a>\n\nSo for giggles I have been doing some Modo work this weekend..   <a href=\"http://www.forgeworld.co.uk/Warhammer-40000/Orks/GROT-TANKS.html\" target=\"_blank\">Warhammer 40k Grot Tanks</a> amuse me so I thought it would be fun to make one in 3D..\n\nI spent the first part of the weekend completely wiping my system and reinstalling windows, redownloading my copy of Modo from luxology and getting everything set back up..  It takes a while, but not too bad to be honest..\n\nOnce that was done I started working on the roadwheels and the track..\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2010/11/TreadsDemo01.jpg\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"Tread Demo 1\" src=\"/images/2010/11/TreadsDemo01-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Tread Demo 1\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Tread Demo 1</span></a>\n\nFirst 4 hours -- It took me forever to figure out how to get the one tread I created to clone around a bezier curve such that all the points matched up.. But once I did I was very excited!!  I think it looks great and it should be fairly easy to animate too..\n\nThe tread itself isn't finished, but since it's just 55ish clones of one tread anything I do to the parent magically appears on all the children.. Good times..\n\nIt's WAAAY too clean for a grot tank right now but I figured I'd make the clean version of everything then dirty it up my mangling the mesh and adding dirty textures..\n\nI had to ask via the Luxology forums how to group the instances correctly such that I could move them.  Otherwise they go all wonky when you click and drag..  But once done it made sense and I was ready to move on to the rest of the tank..\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2010/11/GrotTankDemo01.jpg\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Grot Tank\" src=\"/images/2010/11/GrotTankDemo01-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Grot Tank\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Grot Tank</span></a>\n\n+4 hours -- The next thing I did was build in the basic body shape..  I made sure to build subdivision into this model from the start so it wouldn't be something I would have to go back and do later..\n\nI also spent some time adjusting my environment so that my renders weren't straight up black and white..\n\nI have had a couple folks ask me recently if I thought Modo was worth the money..  For me I have to say yes.. Even though I don't do this professionally, It's just a hobby play thing I still think it was well worth the cost.  For professionals I'd say it's a must have..   Just the amount of work that one can do in a very short time is amazing..  It takes some training and experience, but still its fast going..\n\nAt this point I'm going to continue to work on the model, getting the \"clean\" tank finished before starting to add the bits of scrap metal, plating, rust and grime..etc..\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2010/11/TreadsDemo02.jpg\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"Exhaust\" src=\"/images/2010/11/TreadsDemo02-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Exhaust\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Exhaust</span></a>\n\n+2 hours -- So I spent a couple hours tonight beginning the exhaust system on the back of the tank.. Far from done of course, but looks good.. Again I went through and made sure that the mesh was 100% subdivision compliant and it looks good..\n\nIts far from finished though as I'm not sure what to put inside the cutouts.. This is one place where the model can't help me because its just solid..   I'll come up with something.. Likely something silly.. this is after all a grot tank..\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2010/11/Exhaust01.jpg\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Exhaust 2\" src=\"/images/2010/11/Exhaust01-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Exhaust 2\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Exhaust 2</span></a>\n\n+4 hours -- I spent the next four hours on this model getting the exhaust on the back of the tank looking the way I wanted it to look.   It's pretty close to the model I have and should look darn good once textures are applied.\n\nI probably went a bit overboard on the polycount but oh well that's something I always do anyway..   There is a piece still missing, and that's the little bar/strap that goes from the band around the middle to the tank body.   My practical model only has a stick of resin with no detail connecting the two, and that just wont do.. I'll figure out something.. I have some ideas already..\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2010/11/GrotTankDemo02.jpg\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"Grot Tank\" src=\"/images/2010/11/GrotTankDemo02-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Grot Tank\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Grot Tank</span></a>\n\n+2 hours -- I went through and added a bunch more greebles, nurnies and what's-it's around the tank.. You can't really tell in this image but there are a lot more.  Plus I started working on the tank body though most of the work is on the other side.. heh..\n\nI have a lot more work to do but the main portion will be taking the perfectly looking model and distorting it to make it look beat up and made up scrap metal parts..  Should be fun..\n\nI haven't started the turret yet as I want to get a good handle on the rest of the tank first and there is a lot left to do.. The turret would just get in the way and make me want to work on it..  It's the coolest part after all.. Saving the best for last!\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2010/11/GrotTankDemo03.jpg\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Metal Plating\" src=\"/images/2010/11/GrotTankDemo03-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Metal Plating\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Metal Plating</span></a>\n\n+4 hours -- I have been adding a lot of little deformed plates to the model as per my practical..  Basically they look like extra bits that have been bolted on, but all of them are beat up as befitting a true Grot vehicle..  Eventually I'll have to give the main tank body this same treatment..  But for now adding all the extra plating is taking time..  I'm not have way done with that..\n\nOnce I get the bulk of the plating done, I'll start working on deforming the tank body itself, before adding the rivets and holes etc..  Texturing the noise and destruction on to the model will really make the tank come to life eventually.  Should be good.\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2010/11/GrotTankDemo06.jpg\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"More Detail\" src=\"/images/2010/11/GrotTankDemo06-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"More Detail\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>More Detail</span></a>\n\n+ a bunch of hours -- I have been adding more plating, and generally cleaning up the model..\n\nThe main body is just about ready to start getting its deformation stuff before I get on to working on the turret.  At this point though I think I need to research a better way to make some of these details.. Right now I'm actually modeling everything in which is a huge time sink as well as making the model be an unbelievable number of polygons..\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2010/11/sheetmetal.jpg\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Sheet Metal\" src=\"/images/2010/11/sheetmetal-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Sheet Metal\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Sheet Metal</span></a>\n\nTake for example the sheet metal image to the right.. that's a lot of polygons for what amounts to a pretty small detail on the back of the model..   I'm sure I'll get some points for actually modeling it, but it puts a lot of strain on the renderer..  Right now I'm over 5 million polys and I'm no where near done..\n\nI think this is where the experts know super secret tricks and things that you can do to get that kind of detail without having to actually place pixels.. Bump, normal and parallax maps for example..  No idea how to use/create those though..\n","collection":"posts","url":"/40k-grot-tanks/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2010-11-30-game-review-perpetuum-online.md","collection":"posts","url":"/game-review-perpetuum-online/","path":"_posts/2010-11-30-game-review-perpetuum-online.md","id":"/game-review-perpetuum-online","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Game Review: Perpetuum Online","layout":"post","tags":["Perpetuum","Review"],"image":"/images/2010/11/shots-2010-06-0007.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":true,"allow_comments":false,"date":"2010-11-30 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"game-review-perpetuum-online","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2010-11-14-40k-grot-tanks.md","excerpt":"So for giggles I have been doing some Modo work this weekend.   Warhammer 40k Grot Tanks amuse me so I thought it would be fun to make one in 3D..","id":"/40k-grot-tanks","draft":false,"categories":["Hobbies"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"40k Grot Tanks","layout":"post","tags":["3D Graphics"],"image":"/images/2010/11/GrotTankDemo06.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2010-11-14 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"40k-grot-tanks","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2010-11-13-game-review-call-of-duty-black-ops.md","excerpt":"I really do enjoy the Call of Duty franchise..  It started out as a PC shooter back in 2003 and was pretty much heralded as the game to be or beat..  They continued with expansion after expansion and broadened their horizons to other machines.","id":"/game-review-call-of-duty-black-ops","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Game Review: Call of Duty Black Ops","layout":"post","tags":["Call of Duty","Review"],"image":"/images/2010/11/Black-Ops.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2010-11-13 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"game-review-call-of-duty-black-ops","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2010-11-05-game-review-star-wars-the-force-unleashed-2.md","excerpt":"I never played the first Force Unleashed game and I sorta regretted it as I knew several folks who said it was a pretty good game..  So I was really excited when they announced a Force Unleashed 2 for the PC...
