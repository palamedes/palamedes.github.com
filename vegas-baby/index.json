I know, shocking..   The RIAA, is suing XM for offering a device that allows people to record songs off the XM satellite service.   Recording songs off the radio for home use is 100% legal.  However, because those boondogglers had convinced Sirius to pay a bunch of extra money in the form of a licensing fee, they now want XM to pay as well.    This is yet another example of how the RIAA are a bunch of greedy shits.\n\nWhat's really jacked up is that the RIAA actually insisted that they wouldn't complain about private home recording devices.  Of course, someone has to feed the greedy beast so the sue happy bastards are at it again..\n\nI have to say that every time I see \"RIAA\" .. whatever follows usually pisses me off..  At this point, they are a four letter word.  They are making millions of dollars on their products alone, but have decided that they need more and more so go out of their way to extort money from every poor slob they come across..\n\nThe RIAA claims to help musicians - that seems like a bunch of crap.  It really seems like the RIAA are more for helping the producers the packagers, the big box stores and everything else BUT the musicians.   There are millions of musicians out there who aren't being protected but rather are left out in the cold so that the RIAA can toss another log of money on the fire for one or two \"major\" stars.\n\nHere's a clue guys.. The more you promote music, the more people will consume it.  XM and Sirius are promoting the consumption of music by allowing people to record (crappy recordings) to their own systems.  They aren't discouraging it..The more hoops you force people to jump through the less likely they are to do so..  MP3's cause people to BUY music.. not keep them away from it.   Why do you think iTunes like stores work?\n\nI don't understand why you would sue a service that is promoting your industry - and doing so in a FAR better capacity than you have EVER done..  Instead of continuing to hang on to your outdated business model, why not leap forward into the 90's and embrace this change..\n\nIs this about the publicity that you're getting, because you're getting the wrong kind.  Everyone in their life has known that kid that always needed attention - good attention/bad attention, it didn't matter.. just something.. (Sort of like how some recent \"starlettes\" can't seem to find a pair of underwear..) Is this only about money? Or is all this just about control?\n\nI mean the control argument makes some sense, but not a lot.. The record companies don't want us to use our personal players, and thus promote their songs, because that would remove them from control.  The piracy argument is a bunch of shash we know that because the MPAA/Hollywood have admitted as much by directly saying that DRM is not about preventing piracy.. So is this a control thing?\n\nThe more you sqeeze your fist, the more customers will slip through your fingers..  Consumers vote with their wallets -  I for one wont be buying any more music until the RIAA are gone, and I haven't since 2000.  I'm just one person though, but you keep pissing on the masses the more likely you're signing you're own death.\n\nI have to think that it must be about money because the control thing just doesn't make logical sense..  The problem is you're coming across as a mobster.. and that's not good.  Quick.. someone call Eliot Ness..\n\nThe irony is, you fear piracy so much that you have gone to extraordenary lengths to stop it, only to have created the very environment with which it is acceptable; You have enabled your own downfall.\n","collection":"posts","url":"/the-riaa-pissing-on-the-masses/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2007-02-14-six-figures-for-a-domain.md","collection":"posts","url":"/six-figures-for-a-domain/","path":"_posts/2007-02-14-six-figures-for-a-domain.md","id":"/six-figures-for-a-domain","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Six figures for a domain?!","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2007-02-14 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"six-figures-for-a-domain","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2007-01-22-the-riaa-pissing-on-the-masses.md","excerpt":"So.. yet again the RIAA has decided to sue someone..

Yes, before napster.    Well after I sold it to change music, they did nothing with it.   And I do mean absolutely nothing.  Depressing really.\n\nEventually the domain fell into ruin and actually became a porn site for a while.. heh  After which it was picked up by BuyDomains.com a domain squatter - the bane of the internet (Sorry guys, I think very little of your business model).  They were offering to sell the domain at a \"reasonable rate\".   So seven years later, on a whim and completely for nostalgic reasons since the market is dead, I sent off an email asking how much they wanted for the domain.\n\nI got nothing in response, except to find myself suddenly on their spam list.  (Thankfully I used a disposable email address because I'm sure they sell that crap.)  Eventually I get a message which is from <a href=\"mailto:plamson@buydomains.com\" target=\"_blank\">Peter Lamson</a>, their \"Senior Vice President and General Manager\"  .. the head squatter!  I sent him an email saying that I hadn't actually got a quote yet.. just spam.\n\nHe seemed nice enough and forwarded me to the right people..\n\nAt this point I'd like to take a time out and say, what the hell?!  Their market is selling domains (at ludicrous prices) and in order to buy a domain you must send them an email... to which they don't respond?\n\nI mean if that was your primary contact method shouldn't you .. oh I dunno.. respond?!  You know if your sales are low maybe you should look into that a tad, don't ya think?\n\nAnyway, so after Peter, I got an email from David Helgeson which said the following;\n\n\n    Thank you for touching base with us.\n\n    This domain is currently priced at $64,000.00.\n\n    Let me know that this quote made it out to you and how that price works for you.\n\n    Thanks\n\n    David Helgeson\n    Sales Executive, BuyDomains.com\n\n\nWell there David.. I got the email.. uh.. is that price in pesos? I mean really.. Are you serious?\n\nIf I were asking to buy the domain \"Google.com\" shortly after Google went belly up (riiight), then maybe.. after all that's an extremely valuable company.  But Palavista.com?!  I know EXACTLY what that domain is worth.. I created it.  I am the one that made a small business out of it, and ultimately sold it.\n\nThe price you're asking is just retarded.. It's completely unrealistic, and a foolish business choice on your part.  You've just priced that domain out of reach.  And I mean out of everyones reach.  No one will buy that domain, Ever..  Why would they?   You can pick another one, that you haven't squatted and for the low low price of $70 a year ( or whatever the current going rate is.. )\n\nI hate the whole domain squatter thing.. I think it's retarded.. especially since there is case law that says it can be taken away from you.  Changemusic / Raremediagroup owns the IP for palavista.   They could very likely sue you and get the domain for free.  It's been done -  heh probably to you guys..\n\nI guess your business model is based on hope and stupidity..  You offer a price that is half my annual income and just hope that I'm stupid enough to go for it..   Or you praying that some company will come along and buy it - again why would they.. see the above.\n\nRetarded.  If you guys just offer a more reasonable price you might actually sell some of these things.  Here was my response;\n\n    David,\n\n    As the former owner of that domain, and the creator of palavista.com in the first place.  I can tell you without any doubt what so ever, you will never get that price for that domain. You could drop several of the zero's off the end and still not get that price - It's simply not that useful of a domain.\n\n    At most I would purchase it for nostalgia purposes.. I'll leave you with my initial response upon seeing the price;\n\n    Bhahahhahaha .. Good luck with that..=)\n\n    -Jason\n\nI seriously hope that if they ever do sell it, they send me a big fat F*ck you email saying how much they got for it.   That would amuse me if I was completely wrong and someone bought it for $64 grand.    It wont happen.  But I'd love to be wrong.\n","collection":"posts","url":"/six-figures-for-a-domain/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2007-02-14-six-figures-for-a-domain.md","collection":"posts","url":"/six-figures-for-a-domain/","path":"_posts/2007-02-14-six-figures-for-a-domain.md","id":"/six-figures-for-a-domain","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Six figures for a domain?!","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2007-02-14 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"six-figures-for-a-domain","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2007-03-02-vegas-baby.md","content":"Well we just got back from a three day in Vegas..

This rant is for you!\n\nAnytime you find your self in the predicament of being trapped in a small box with one or more complete strangers, it's time to employ the use of something that most people never use; Manners.  You might even want to whip out and dust off, common sense, another ill-used and often neglected commodity.\n\nMost likely this torturous sojourn will only last a minute or two, but sometimes it can seem like forever. This is largely due to the fact that most people are completely oblivious to the fact that they are being painfully discourteous and down right rude to the other passengers.  To the \"others\" I say; You're not alone, and you're not the most important person there.  Suspend any and all activity (with the exception of breathing and heart beats) until you get off the elevator.\n\nTo the complainers I say; there is a certain amount of \"discomfort\" that you're going to have to accept here due to the relative size of the elevator. Short and sweet, you either share the space with the \"others\" or you use the stairs.  To the \"others\" I say; try to make that situation as comfortable as possible by following some extremely simple rules;\n\n__When waiting for the elevator, don't stand directly infront of the door. __\n\nDuh.  There is a good chance people are going to be getting off the elevator, so don't block the door ya dolt.\n\n__If the button has already been pushed, don't push it again.__\n\nHey guys. If you walk up to an elevator and someone has already push the UP button, pushing it more wont make the elevator go any faster.  Its not like the elevator thinks, \"Oh Mr. Highandmighty is waiting.. I better hurry..\".. No.. it just makes you look like an ass.. Stand there and wait patiently!\n\n__Before getting on the elevator, let those who are already on get off first.__\n\nDon't try to crowd your fat ass on to the elevator while people are trying to get off!  This is mostly to women.. YOU WAIT!   When everyone that is getting off, then and only then, may you proceed onto the elevator.  I can't tell you how many times people have tried to push their way onto an elevator when people where trying to exit.  You can wait 10 seconds for them to exit.\n\n__If the elevator is full, wait for the next one.__\n\nDear god.. the 1 minute it takes for the elevator to come back wont kill you.  If the compartment is full, don't try to elbow your way among the other sardines.. Just wait!\n\n__Push the button for your floor once, or not at all if already lit.__\n\nYou impatient shit!  Don't sit there pounding on the floor button because you're in a hurry.. the whole world is in a hurry, slow down and wait.  The extra 3 seconds it takes for the door to close wont kill you.  You just end up looking like an ass.\n\n__Don't push or even touch the close door button.__\n\nYet again, impatient jerks will stand there hammering on the close door button.  'cause they are in a hurry.. Never mind grandma who is trying to get on the elevator; \"no I want the door to close! I'm in a hurry!\"  Fuck you.  Keep your fat digit away from the close door button.  I'd be fine if they removed it completely..  Or better yet, everytime you poke it the elevator voice should say \"The button pusher is an asshole!\" really loudly.  You can wait. It takes what?  3 seconds.. maybe 5.. Oh gosh.. we might be late!\n\n__Hold the door open for people. __\n\nIf someone is very clearly coming to the elevator, hold the damn door for them you selfish bitch.  Ladies, if someone is walking through a door behind you.. HOLD THE DOOR!  Same goes for elevators.  The world doesn't revolve around you.\n\n__When entering the elevator, go as far back as possible.__\n\nYo! Meatsack!  Move all the way to the back of the elevator to make room.  Most likely there are more people getting on the elevator.. Move your tub of guts out of the way.\n\n__Whoever is in front, goes first.__\n\nLadies, if someone is in front of you getting off the elevator (you are both going to the same floor) THEY GO FIRST.  I have actually seen on more than one occasion women claw there way from the back of the elevator so they can get off before someone that was right next to the door. Fuck you. You wait! Again, and this may seem like a theme,  3 or 4 seconds wont kill you.\n\n__If the car is crowded, ask for your floor.__\n\nIf you get on the elevator, and you can't reach the buttons - hell even if you can, just blurt out a floor.  Followed by that rarely used word \"Please\".  It may take several tries to pronounce it correctly, so you may want to practice..    Try it the next time you get on an elevator.. \"3 please\".  I bet you someone will be more than happy to push the button for you.. Most likely followed by pushing the close door button.\n\n__Face the door you're exiting.__\n\nRemember, personal space is at a premium on an elevator.  And thus to help maximized the sense of area around individuals it's best to not look them in the eye.  Don't be an obnoxious twit and stare at someone.  Face the door.. Eyes front dirtbag!\n\n__Don't preen in the mirror.__\n\nMany elevators have a mirrored finish, this isn't an excuse to put on makeup ladies. You should have done that shit at home.. and most likely it didn't do any good anyway.. Put it away!  And the next bitch who puts on hairspray while I'm standing next to her in the elevator gets curbstomped.  I mean seriously.. Hairspray!\n\n.. I can keep going for days.. Most of these rules are very simple and are easily covered by \"Common sense\".. which is so uncommon as to be a rare commodity..   Sometimes I wish we could bottle it and sell it.. But thats for another thread..\n\nNeedless to say, be polite on elevators.  There is a good chance that you're going to be sharing the same elevator with the same people over and over.

Trust me..\n\nI really like my yard.. It's nice to have a huge yard in front of the house that looks good.. but upkeep can suck.  We bought a tractor mower shortly after moving in so I don't have to push mow the beast (did that twice.. it took me 3+ hours).. Now I need some anti-weed machine that can keep it clear of unwanted shrubbery..\n\nWe have a lot of stuff we want to do around the outside of the house, it's just really costly and we aren't made of money.  I wish we could just win the lottery or something and then we could pay a pack of Mexicans to do the hard work for us..   (Something I would be more than happy to do.)\n\nBut then everything goes back to the \"I wish I had a lot of money\" issue.  I do hope that wish comes true one day.\n","collection":"posts","url":"/pulling-weeds-in-my-big-ass-yard/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2007-03-22-webbased-4x-game-in-the-moo-vein.md","collection":"posts","url":"/webbased-4x-game-in-the-moo-vein/","path":"_posts/2007-03-22-webbased-4x-game-in-the-moo-vein.md","id":"/webbased-4x-game-in-the-moo-vein","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Webbased 4X game in the MoO vein","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2007-03-22 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"webbased-4x-game-in-the-moo-vein","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2007-03-12-pulling-weeds-in-my-big-ass-yard.md","excerpt":"<p>1 Acre = 4047 Square Meters\n1 Acre = 4640 Square Yards\n1 Acre = 41260 Square Feet\n1 Acre = 8*80 gallon bags of weeds\n1 Acre = A very very sore Jason</p>\n","id":"/pulling-weeds-in-my-big-ass-yard","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Pulling weeds in my big ass yard","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2007-03-12 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"pulling-weeds-in-my-big-ass-yard","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2007-03-12-elevator-etiquette.md","excerpt":"For anyone who has ever in their life previously, or may at some point in the future, use a vertical assention device - a.k.a. an Elevator..
