In fact, I don't work at any job that is minimum wage or there abouts because in my opinion, it's not a livable wage.  And, to be completely honest, I don't understand how people manage to live on so little income.\n\nInstead, I chose a career path that requires a lot of technical knowledge and skill in order to stay competitive in the industry and that pays well enough that I can continue to live the lifestyle I enjoy.\n\nPart of my job is to entertain offers for work from prospective clients. This typically includes hours (often days) of communication, information gathering, research, and other unbillable time that I have to put in for them before I get paid a dime.\n\nThe ultimate goal of which is to divide up the work with the intent of putting hourly and iterative work totals to their software desire which gives them a cost estimate for the work they want done.   \n\nThis is the only part of my job I hate.  I hate it because all clients want the sky, the moon, and stars -- for free or very little money and scoff and demand to know why we are 'so expensive'.  \n\nWe aren't - In fact I know a lot of firms that charge a lot more than we do.  We are realistic.\n\nAn example prospective client hit us up today with a 20 page document (small type!) full of all the requirements that had to be met in order for us to be complete, had less than 3 months to do the work, and wanted the whole shebang for $10,000.   All the while bemoaning the previous developers that offered to do the work for that amount but who were unresponsive. \n\n(I will admit that having such thorough document to talk to is great!  Many clients show up with nothing but a dream only to have their hopes dashed when we start asking hard questions that they don't have answers to.  Define your product, or we can help you define it.  But if I define it, it will be an MVP/POC first and iterate into a full blown product.  This is a topic for a different post though.)\n\nBut the common thread is that no matter the scope of the work, they always think we are too expensive and quite often expect to pay less than half or even a quarter of what is reasonable. \n\nFor example; The $10k job above would have required at least two full time developers to get it done within the 3 month deadline, if it's even possible to make the deadline without working a lot of overtime.  But assuming its possible to get it done in the time allotted; $10k divided by roughly 60 days, at 8 hours a day, for 2 developers ends up being just above $10 an hour over the life of the project and that's before taxes.  \n\nNot a livable wage.  A plumber makes more.\n\nI didn't spend the last 20+ years getting experience in my industry and spending an unconscionable amount of extra time becoming an expert to work for so little. It requires a lot of time, effort and energy on my part to stay current and competitive in my industry so I have very little patience with people who think I get paid too much money for what I do. \n\nSorry, but anyone who says software engineers and architects get paid too much, don't understand what it takes to do what we do.\n\nI think the issue is most people just see the initial number and think its a lot.   On the surface, $10k is a lot of money.  And if I were given $10k for doing nothing then I'd be happy as a clam.\n\nMost people have no concept the amount of work, time, and effort that goes into writing software and as such they can't really fathom it.  Because they can't wrap their mind around it and because there is nothing physical to put value to, it's very easy to think that they are paying us that $10k for nothing and that we should be just happy as a clam for being offered it.\n\nIt pains me to have to be the one to explain to them that this isn't the case.  The problem comes when you have those people that are actually offended by the amount I say it would actually require in order to pull their dream off.   I'm usually looked at as a greedy bastard and thought of as a criminal.\n\nMost firms would charge closer to $100k for that 3 month job.  See what I mean?  You scoffed a little didn't you.\n\nAnd I'm just talking about the initial development cost.  Not maintenance fees, server hardware, data storage fees, design costs, testing costs etc..  \n\nThe problem with going with the $10k firm versus the $100k firm is that you get what you pay for.  The perceived value is in dollars only, without any thought or consideration to the quality of the work being done or the support you're going to get before start, during development and after completion.  (We give 6 months of bugfixes for free.)\n\nThey have already approached $10k firm for the product and they don't like the support / communication they were getting (read: the firm has just disappeared because 10k for this project is too low), so why are they looking for another $10k firm that will likely give them the exact same results?  \n\nYou get what you pay for and people some how refuse to learn that lesson with software.  \n\n\n\n\n\n","collection":"posts","url":"/price-of-software/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2013-12-10-state-of-industry.md","collection":"posts","url":"/state-of-industry/","path":"_posts/2013-12-10-state-of-industry.md","id":"/state-of-industry","draft":false,"categories":["Software Development"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"State of the Industry Concerns","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2013/12/cliff.jpg","gallery":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"tile_class":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2013-12-10 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"state-of-industry","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2013-12-06-price-of-software.md","excerpt":"You get what you pay for and people some how refuse to learn that lesson with software.","id":"/price-of-software","draft":false,"categories":["Software Development"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Software Development Costs","layout":"post","tags":["Costs"],"image":"/images/2013/12/software-development-costs.jpg","gallery":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"tile_class":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2013-12-06 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"price-of-software","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2013-12-10-state-of-industry.md","content":"I gotta be honest with you; I'm exceedingly concerned with the state of my industry.  I take umbrage with what frameworks like wordpress and jquery have done to us.  On the one hand they are great tools that serve a purpose and fill a need, but on the other you have a whole generation of people who have only ever learned how to use them and don't understand the underlying technology.. At all. \n\nAt GROK, we are interviewing \"developers\" and trying to find that right hire.  But the number of folks that have come forward claiming to be PHP experts have apparently really only ever worked with wordpress and as such have virtually zero understanding of PHP as a language.  How can you call yourself a PHP expert and not understand the object model? Or even what an object is in a couple cases.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the folks who say they know jquery and are an expert with it, but also say they don't know javascript... What?! That doesn't even make sense.. \n\nThat's like someone saying they are an accountant who is an expert at quickbooks, but that they don't understand basic accounting..  \n\nThe real tragedy is that these folks are able to get 85k to 120k jobs with their paltry skills and think its completely reasonable to expect to get more when they move on.   I think they are setting themselves up for an incredible fall.\n\nI have done a number of interviews now with different folks and while some of them were knowledgeable and good, some were embarrassingly bad.  \n\nMy interview style is rough but friendly.  It's no where near as bad as some of the pressure cooker/shark tanks I have been to in my day, but I expect you to know what you say you know at the level you say you know it.  \n\nIf I ask you what your PHP skill is 0 to 10 and you tell me 10, I'm gonna ask you questions that I would expect only Rasmus Lerdorf to know.   It stuns me how many people claim to be a 9 or 10, when they aren't even a 3..  This is what wordpress has done to us..  Same thing happens with javascript and jquery or any of the myriad of other frameworks out there. \n\nI realize we all have to start somewhere, but quite a lot of these people think they are senior developers when they wouldn't even qualify as a junior one.\n\nDo yourself a favor, learn the underlying technology.  Ask yourself; 'Why does this work?' \n\nA Javascript expert should be able to create their own jquery from scratch.  I'm not saying they should, just that they understand how it works and why it works and could if they needed to.  There's no mystery to it to them, it's just a tool.\n\nA PHP expert should be able to write wordpress from scratch.  etc..  (Come to think of it, a true PHP expert would look at the wordpress source and shudder.. )\n\nWhen your software goes from 'magic' to just another tool in your toolbox that you fully understand, then you can call yourself an expert.  Until then, you have some learning to do.\n","collection":"posts","url":"/state-of-industry/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2013-12-10-state-of-industry.md","collection":"posts","url":"/state-of-industry/","path":"_posts/2013-12-10-state-of-industry.md","id":"/state-of-industry","draft":false,"categories":["Software Development"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"State of the Industry Concerns","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2013/12/cliff.jpg","gallery":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"tile_class":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2013-12-10 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"state-of-industry","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2013-12-30-oculus-rift.md","content":"The Oculus Rift is an up and coming virtual reality head-mounted display being developed by Oculus VR, who as of this writing has raised over $90MM US dollars to fund this hardware wet dream.\n\nFor Christmas my business partner and I decided to go ahead and splurge on a couple of the developer kit versions of the OR because we have some development ideas that we want to explore.\n\nBut of course we also wanted them just to play with them and check them out.  Holy crap.  It's awesome.  Not perfect by any stretch of the meaning, but as developer kits go it's impressive as hell.  Once the final consumer version comes out, you should get one.\n\nThe developers kit is very nice and extremely professionally produced.  The Rift unit itself seems pretty solid and works well once you get used to it (more on that in a minute).\n\nWhat amazes me about it is how good the accelerometers are.  The head tracking system is perfect.  I expected it to be kinda crappy to be honest, or lag a little when you turned your head but it really isn't.  Accelerometer technology has come a long way and the precision there is excellent.\n\nThe unit itself isn't heavy and in fact I stopped noticing it after the first 5 minutes.\n\nThe cost of the unit itself is $300 for the developer kit and they are guessing the final version will be between $300 and $400.  I think this is completely reasonable as it's essentially just another monitor.  How much did you pay for your nicest monitor?\n\nAs for the bad -- this is all I can really think of;\n\n_*Developer Kit Resolution:*_ The developer kit is very very good, but its really low resolution.  The system works by putting a small flat screen (think cellphone) about 3 inches from your eyes and putting two images on that single screen that you look at through lenses.   The picture as you have probably seen is just a fisheye view of whatever the game or software is displaying split in two and slightly offset to give you the left/right eye.  Clever.   But the dev kit has a 1280x800 resolution.  That means its effectively 640x800 per eye.  That's pretty poor.   The image itself while amazingly responsive and the over all performance of the unit is good, the image looks kind of like an image made with lego blocks a couple feet away.\n\nThe good news is they are working on the Resolution and the final version will be a lot higher.  So for a developer cheap version, this is awesome.\n\n_*Positional Tracking:*_ As I said in the review above the orientation tracking is amazing.  The unit itself has a gyroscope/accelerometer system that makes unit orientation spot on.  I was very happy with this, they did a fantastic job here.  But it has no positional tracking what so ever and likely wont ever have that without another piece of hardware.\n\nFor those familiar with the Track IR piece of hardware it gets around positional tracking by forcing you to put something on your head in order to get position in space, without that I'm not sure how good positional tracking could be.\n\nBut I hesitated to put this here as I dont know that it needs positional tracking.  I imagine there will be some pieces of software that could benefit from it, but for the most part I don't know that it's needed.\n\n_*Motion Sickness:*_ I NEVER get motion sick.  Never.  Not at all. .... or at least not until I used the Oculus Rift for 20 minutes.  This says a lot to me.  I know my wife and my best friend get motion sick if you show them a first person shooter for a minute or two.  I don't.   In fact one of my favorite games of all time was <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descent_(video_game)\" target=\"_blank\">Descent</a> a true 360 degree first person shooting game.  This is a game that was known for (and eternally banned for) making my buddy nearly projectile vomit. heh  Loved it.\n\nAnyway, the rift made me feel very queasy.  Stunned me actually.  But after 3 sessions of 20 minutes or so, I was able to play for an hour before it started to hit me.  So it's clear to me that this is something you just have to get used to.. But be warned.  I know some people that once they get motion sick are down for hours.\n\nMy only other suggestion or wish (aside from the higher resolution thing which is already coming) would be to have a slightly wider field a view.  I want it to wrap around more.\n\nBut seriously those are really minor complaints all things considered =)  If you're any kind of gamer at all, once the consumer version comes out.. get it..

That dream still holds true and I have begun the process.  But my plans might be changing.\n\nI still want to get a DA42, or a Cirrus SR22 or even a Cessna 400 but the simple fact of the matter is they are amazingly, stunningly and astronomically expensive.   Even so, I still started the process of getting my pilots license.  I have taken a couple lessons since then looking for a good instructor, got my 3rd class medical that is required for aviation and outfitted myself with all the accoutrements I would need to make it happen.   It's still a very real possibility.\n\nBut then I started to really think about what I would use it for.  The \"Mission\" as most GA pilots refer to it.  My initial goal was to get an airplane for the occasional flights back and forth to Texas from Georgia.  And that with an airplane of my own I could make that trip more often.  This is completely unrealistic.\n\nI, like most people, hate commercial airlines, but I can buy a round trip ticket to Texas for under $300 right now.  Sure there is the discomfort of the commercial aircraft, the crowds, the airport hassle, the delays, the TSA..etc.. but at that price point, I simply can't warrant getting my own aircraft.  Unfortunately, it would cost me more than that to put fuel in it for the trip to Texas -- one way.   Add to that airplane costs, maintenance, hangar space, licensing..etc.. and it just doesn't make sense at all.\n\nThis was a real downer to ponder by the way.  Everyone knows it's expensive, but now I can actually put real numbers to it.  Wow.  The plane alone that I would need to get in order to realistically do this mission in a timely manner would cost me over $350k -- used.  Not counting fuel and all the other monthly/yearly expenses.  Sure I could get a plane that costs a lot less, but it's still cost prohibitive.\n\nThis really was a pretty harsh dashing of my flying dreams.  Not that I can't do it, or even that I couldn't afford it.  I could actually, but it doesn't make sense.  It was expensive enough to trip my financial warning meter.\n\nEnter Soaring.\n\nA couple weeks ago I got to go gliding/soaring at the Chilhowee Gliderport in TN and had a blast.  I posted a video of it on youtube: [Gliding at Chilhowee](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvnCj-zZlpc)\n\nSuddenly a whole new option opened up;  Gliding!\n\nFirstly, it's safe.  Most folks don't understand how safe it actually is and are under the mistaken impression that the lack of an engine means it's some how dangerous.  Couldn't be further from the truth.  There are dangers involved of course, but it's not any more dangerous than flying a plane, riding a motorcycle, driving a car... walking.  Etc.\n\nSecondly, it's cheap!  Everything about soaring is a lot cheaper than powered general aviation.  Stunningly so.  It costs maybe $2k to get your glider pilots license versus closer to $10k for powered flight (or higher if you're using a \"pilot factory\" school like the ones Cessna puts on)\n\nAnd then there's the cost of aircraft ... Wow! So much cheaper!  A top of the line multiperson glider with all the bells and whistles is something like $300k to $400k.  And I mean that's the end of the price range.. that's the top dog.  A $300k to $400k powered aircraft is excellent to be sure, but it's no where near top dog.\n\nFinally, it's a more realistic mission.  To have fun.\n\nI can suffer commercial to fly back and forth to Texas when I need to go (going this January), but to have fun in the sky I can use a glider.  I knew that I wanted to fly just for the joy of flying once I had gotten my GA license, but the cost would make that a lot less fun.   Well gliders are so much cheaper you can do it for virtually nothing if you rent.   You can easily rent a nice glider, tow to altitude and fly around all day for under $200.  Awesome.\n\n","collection":"posts","url":"/i-want-to-soar/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2014-01-03-i-want-to-soar.md","collection":"posts","url":"/i-want-to-soar/","path":"_posts/2014-01-03-i-want-to-soar.md","id":"/i-want-to-soar","draft":false,"categories":["Aviation","Hobbies"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"I want to go soaring","layout":"post","tags":["Soaring"],"image":"/images/2014/01/glider-on-ground.jpg","gallery":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"tile_class":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2014-01-03 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"i-want-to-soar","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2014-03-10-coins-pyramid-ponzi-both-neither.md","content":"I have been pondering this at length -- Is bitcoin (or any of the alt-coins) a ponzi or pyramid scheme?\n\nI personally like to look at coins as an investment, but many people decry that coins in any form are a ponzi or pyramid scheme.  A waste of money, time and effort and will only serve to give criminals a way to transfer money back and forth in secret.\n\nWell.. Okay it's hard to argue with that last one as the whole point of coins is to be a currency free from government oversight, so yes criminals will likely use it.  But if there is value to them and the current state of bitcoin implies there is, it's certainly not a waste of time and money.  But I get ahead of myself.\n\nA lot of people are saying that coins are simply a pyramid scheme or a pump and dump ponzi.  I agree and disagree.\n\nFirstly, All of the coins, no matter which you decide to go with, favor early adopters which is one of the typical hallmarks of such schemes but so does any investment really.\n\nIs it a pyramid?  I would agree that all of the crypto-currencies are way more volatile than most mainstream investments, but I don't think its quite a pyramid.\n\nPyramids or any multilevel marketing scheme as I understand them work such that everyone at the top is a direct beneficiary to the new people coming on board.  As each new level is created, the rich at top get richer on the backs of the newbies, and typically there is a point at which all those people at top bail leaving the rest with nothing.\n\nThat's not whats happening here. The fact that I'm mining coins has zero effect on the people that came to it before me and in fact the opposite is true.  By my mining coins, I'm actually devaluing the coins already mined..\n\nCoins by their very nature are a 100% deflationary currency.  That means that the more of it that is mined the less value the amount you already have has.  In theory each coin has a finite amount but each coin handles that upper limit differently and I know some coins have no upper limit.  \n\nTo give an example bitcoins have a max of 21 million coins, there can never be more than that.  As more coins are mined the value of the coins you have go down due to supply and demand, and in the case of those coins with no upper limit your coins could become worthless over time just due to the flood of coins on the market, though that would take a long time due to the difficulty increases imposed on mining over time.\n\nIn many ways, coins are more like the stock market than a pyramid, if I buy coins (which I have ZERO intention of doing btw) I'm increasing the value of the coin, just like the stock market.  Google stock was $85 back when it was new, now its $1220.  It's worth that much because people valued the company enough to buy the stock making the stock hard to get, causing the stock value to go up.. supply and demand 101.\n\nWith coins however there is this added injection of units through mining where as with stock typically the only way for more stock to come into being is through stock splits or secondary offerings.\n\nThe primary difference is in the backing and I see the sticking point that a lot of poeple have trouble with;  Most argue that google stock is backed up by a company, where as coins are backed up by the hopes, dreams, and wishes of the neckbeards and fedoras who think they are the smartest people in the room. And not much else.\n\nThey have no intrinsic value unlike pelts, skins, beads and shells of yesteryear or the modern currencies backed up by whole nations. They are valuable entirely because people say they are. \n\nThe question is, is that enough?  I dunno.  I'm skeptical.  I think it's likely not over the long haul, but I have been wrong before.\n\nIf you read some of the manifesto's around about the various alt-coins I truly believe that the intent is good and righteous.  But we are still talking about the mark 1 human being and as such people will find a way to abuse and seek personal gain just out of pure greed.\n\nAnd that's the issue.  That's where the pump and dump ponzi aspect rears it's ugly head.\n\nThis is a currency that lends it self to being abused easily because it's entirely computer based and a complete mystery to most people. You're not paying any of the original investors like a ponzi or pyramid, and yes your pie is getting bigger at the same rate as theirs if you're mining but the potential for abuse and misuse is massive.\n\nThe stellar lack of understanding lends it self to criminal behavior; In many ways I liken it to the stock market, the rich who are in the know will invest wisely and make a lot of money, where as the people who don't know will get bilked out of their hard earned cash simply because they don't know what to do and what not to do.  And unlike the stock market, there is a complete lack of government oversight and regulations and a lack of physical assets -- not even paper in the case of some stock.\n\nThis is why I do believe it's a ponzi on some levels, or rather it lends itself to being a ponzi because people can use it as a mechanism to lure the unwary and make personal gains from other peoples losses.  It is not a ponzi in and of itself, but it can easily be used as one by even the youngest hipster script kiddie.  \n\nIn many ways the whole thing reminds me of the early US when every state, province, town and bank had it's own currency and they were struggling to figure it out.  The difference being, unlike those early currencies there is absolutely no safety net.  No real hard \"thing\" to back up the value of the various currencies.\n\nIt's an interesting time.  And I think so long as you mine without investing any really money in it, no loss..  My computer was on crunching numbers anyway for Seti or World Community Grid..  Really they are the ones losing out.","collection":"posts","url":"/coins-pyramid-ponzi-both-neither/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2014-09-11-learning-to-fly.md","collection":"posts","url":"/learning-to-fly/","path":"_posts/2014-09-11-learning-to-fly.md","id":"/learning-to-fly","draft":false,"categories":["Aviation","Hobbies"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Learning to fly!","layout":"post","tags":["General Aviation"],"image":"/images/2014/09/N84086.jpg","gallery":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"tile_class":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2014-09-11 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"learning-to-fly","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2014-03-10-coins-pyramid-ponzi-both-neither.md","excerpt":"I have been pondering this at length -- Is bitcoin (or any of the alt-coins) a ponzi or pyramid scheme?
