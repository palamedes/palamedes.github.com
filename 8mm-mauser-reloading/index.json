Those who love it can play it.. I for one very likely wont be and there are two primary reasons for this;\n\n* The people playing are douche bags\n* Just like SC1, the game is wildly out of balance\n\nI'm playing in the friend and family beta and STILL the people I play against are rabid pricks..  People say all the time that MMO (WoW specifically) players are rude and jerks, and I have to say they are nothing compared to the Starcraft players..   It's like all the lame ass epeen stuff you see in MMO's that a player does over the course of the year or two he plays the game is compressed into one 20 minute game and so they have to be extra big douche bags just to be sure you know how uber they are and how much you suck..\n\nI want to play any game of this nature against my friends or coworkers, and no one else.. I don't want to have to suffer the fanboy jackasses who feel the need to tell you how much you suck every five minutes just to make themselves feel better..   I mean seriously how pathetic are you that you have to continually tell others they suck to make yourself feel better..\n\nMy second point is the balance issue..  I'm sorry but I always felt Starcraft 1 was out of balance..   Well guess what.. Starcraft 2 is also unbalanced..  And you'd think that Blizzard might take it as a clue that if everyone is playing one race, and no one is playing another race.. there's a reason for it.\n\nI just got finished playing a 2v2 game in which the opponents partner quit about 10 seconds into the game..  So it was actually a 2v1 game with 2 Zerg players versus 1 Terran player.\n\nI always play Zerg, and this was the VERY FIRST TIME I had seen another player intentionally play Zerg..  In all the other games I have played so far, everyone plays Terran..  Clue one that Terran are over powered is that everyone plays them.. I have seen a few folks play protoss but not many..\n\nAnd We played for something like 45 minutes, two Zerg versus one Terran and couldn't beat him.  2v1 and we lost.    We used up ALL the resources on the map and weren't able to get him out of his bolt hole..   Yes.. ALL of the resources.. I had 6 bases by the end of the game and my partner had 4..  The opponent just proceeded to nuke us into oblivion and all the attacking we did in the world did no good what so ever..\n\nHe had SWARMS of stuff flying and running around, was poking us from all sides as well as a continual nuke spam, and was mounting an impossible defense of our combined and organized attacks..  And he only ever had 2 bases.. He also had ample time to tell us how much we sucked..\n\nI know I'm not great at this game.. but I'm not that darn bad.. and my partner seemed to know what he was doing..  I think it's a pretty clear case of one side being over powered..\n\nI tried to ask the Terran player what he was doing and he proceeded to tell me how great he was and how my parents should be embarrassed they gave birth to me...   This is a friend or a family member of a Blizzard employee..   Fine.. Fuck you.. You can have this game, I don't want it..\n","collection":"posts","url":"/im-about-to-say-fuck-starcraft-2/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2010-03-08-ubisoft-and-their-drm.md","collection":"posts","url":"/ubisoft-and-their-drm/","path":"_posts/2010-03-08-ubisoft-and-their-drm.md","id":"/ubisoft-and-their-drm","draft":false,"categories":["Games","Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Ubisoft and their DRM","layout":"post","tags":["Ubisoft","DRM"],"image":"/images/2010/03/drm.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2010-03-08 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"ubisoft-and-their-drm","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2010-02-27-im-about-to-say-fuck-starcraft-2.md","excerpt":"So I have been playing in the Starcraft 2 beta and to be honest, I'm not overly impressed.  It's basically the same game brought forward with some refinement..  Fine..

Someone who is willing to pirate software isn't willing to pay for it.. EVER!  So you never had their money in the first place..\n\nYou're trying so hard to capture that imagined lost revenue that it's blinding you to how badly you're screwing yourselves and your real customers..\n\nEquating the number of pirated copies of your software directly to dollars is retarded.. More over, implementing these harsh DRM models only serves to prevent the honest players from playing your games, which effectively assures that you're going to lose real money in the form of people who actually DO buy your games going else where..\n\nLet take the new Silent Hunter 5 game as an example..   SH5 (a game with a lot of bugs and other issues that already pisses paying customers off) comes with the new DRM which forces you to be connected to the internet 100% of the time.   The new system which the Ubisoft exec's spin as being a positive thing for the customer is constantly phoning home to make sure you're still allowed to play the game.. The game you purchased.\n\nIf at any time during your play period the connection to the mother ship fails, you stop playing the game.  You can't save your game.. You can't do anything..  Effectively the game you purchased goes into cripple ware mode..  This is bullshit.\n\nThe hacker community took one good look at that and said \"F'to you Ubi\" and hacked it within the first 24 hours of release..  These people had no intention of buying the game in the first place so who does it actually hurt?\n\nME!  If I'm playing the game that I purchased and I go on a road trip with my laptop, I can't play it..  The hacker can.. he can play just fine..\n\nIf I am playing the game that I purchased at home and for whatever reason my internet goes out (it happens), I'm screwed..   Not the hacker.. He can keep playing..\n\nSo.. whats my recourse?  Nothing.. I'm just shit out of luck.. I have to either accept their crappy DRM because apparently they think I'm the problem, or not buy the game in the first place..  The hacker doesn't care, he isn't troubled by these problems at all and in no way has the DRM affected him at all..\n\nDRM only punishes the paying customer!  Ubisoft is trying like hell to spin their new DRM in a positive light, but it's not..  they claim that it's \"A platform of online services for PC titles offering gamers a more in-depth gaming experience as well as providing an innovative solution for reducing PC game piracy.\"   HUH?!\n\nHow did you do either of those things?   It does absolutely NOTHING to offer me a more in-depth gaming experience and in fact does the opposite in that suddenly I have this invasive piece of software on my system that prevents me from playing at all from time to time..  I paid for the game, yet I'm punished.\n\nAnd it doesn't prevent or even reduce software piracy considering it was hacked out in the first 24 hours.  The hackers never even notice the games DRM, it doesn't bother them in the slightest..\n\nAt this point you're actually encouraging people like me to hack the game because your own DRM is preventing the honest player from playing the game he paid for..  That's right.. your DRM which is there to prevent piracy is actually encouraging piracy because otherwise we can't play the game..  Good job genius..\n\nYou're so busy counting the imaginary lost dollars you're missing the fact that your real dollars are heading out the door.. The proof is in the pudding.. Your current sales for this year are down by over 20% and I have to think you only have yourselves to blame..\n\nI realize fully that the \"higher ups\" are the ones making these decisions, but someone MUST stand up and tell them why DRM is not the right solution..  If you guys don't stop the DRM shenanigans you guys are going to hemorrhage not money, but customers..\n","collection":"posts","url":"/ubisoft-and-their-drm/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2010-03-08-ubisoft-and-their-drm.md","collection":"posts","url":"/ubisoft-and-their-drm/","path":"_posts/2010-03-08-ubisoft-and-their-drm.md","id":"/ubisoft-and-their-drm","draft":false,"categories":["Games","Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Ubisoft and their DRM","layout":"post","tags":["Ubisoft","DRM"],"image":"/images/2010/03/drm.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2010-03-08 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"ubisoft-and-their-drm","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2010-03-15-8mm-mauser-reloading.md","content":"<img title=\"Reloading Press\" src=\"/images/2010/03/reloadpress-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" class='pull-right' />\n\nI really enjoy shooting..  I always have..  In the military I would go to the range every weekend and throw some rounds down range just for the pure joy of it..  And while I would sometimes shoot my pistols, I prefer rifles..  I dunno what it is, but there is something very peaceful about the focus and presence of mind you need to effectively shoot a rifle..\n\nI liked it because when shooting, all the cares of the day seemed to kinda slip away..  You had to focus on what you're doing and not be distracted by anything in order to hit your target, especially at range..  I have missed it..\n\nThe main reason I have missed it was due to cost, and distance..  Simply put there aren't any ranges near where I live, and since my primary round is 7.92x57mm Mauser it can get a tad pricey..  Enter reloading..\n\nI have wanted to get back into shooting something fearce and have been trolling several shooter forums trying to find a new inexpensive round that I can shoot that would afford me the accuracy I require in a cost effective manner..   A lot of people have suggested .223, .308 or even 6br..

Frankly it's a greedy ploy by all the companies involved and ultimately as with anything else, we pay the price.   If Time Warner raises their rates I will leave.  Vote with your wallet people..\n","collection":"posts","url":"/get-ready-to-pay-more-for-bandwidth/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2010-04-08-the-sonic-infusion.md","collection":"posts","url":"/the-sonic-infusion/","path":"_posts/2010-04-08-the-sonic-infusion.md","id":"/the-sonic-infusion","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"The Sonic Infusion","layout":"post","tags":["Media"],"image":"/images/2010/04/si-150x150.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":true,"allow_comments":false,"date":"2010-04-08 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"the-sonic-infusion","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2010-04-07-get-ready-to-pay-more-for-bandwidth.md","excerpt":"Most gamers typically play games online, download expansions or other forms of DLC, watch hulu, stream music..etc.. generally speaking, use more bandwidth than your average user who just browses the occasional website or checks email.","id":"/get-ready-to-pay-more-for-bandwidth","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Get ready to pay more for bandwidth...","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2010/04/netneutrality-150x150.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2010-04-07 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"get-ready-to-pay-more-for-bandwidth","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2010-04-05-cant-talk-playing-rock-band.md","excerpt":"So I haven't updated my blog in a while because all my spare time has been spent playing Rockband 2..
