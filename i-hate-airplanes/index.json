Grand Turismo was always my favorite franchise on the PS2 because the game was absolutely beautiful and fun to play.  However, I hated always being tied to the PS2.  I am not a big fan of console games, but it seems that our stock of racing games for PC have been fairly lack-luster.\n\nNot any more!  <a href=\"http://www.codemasters.com/grid/\" target=\"_blank\">Codemaster's, GRID</a> is a fantastic game.. Codemasters yet again earns the faith I put in them for a high quality product.. (Operation Flashpoint 2 better rule!)\nw\nOnce you get past the fact that you buy and sell cars through \"eBay Motors\" the game is quite enjoyable.. (I can't blame them for product placement.. I assume by letting Ebay, Champion, Valvoline... etc... add product placement and branding they can make the game for a lot less... Sponsors baby.. sponsors! It's not overly out of place and for the most part you don't even notice it.. )\n\nThe cars seem to drive pretty realistically and the realistic crash damage is awesome and adds a dynamic element to  the game..\n\nThe cars all move exactly as you would expect them to.  They seem to have real \"weight\" when they move which I like.  So many other car simulations just don't get it.. Codemasters really captured the feel of how a vehicle show move..\n\nOne thing I really think is a nice touch is that you can setup the game to know your real name, and as such say it when they talk to you. They recorded probably a 100 common names, both male and female as well as a bunch of nick names.. You can choose one as your \"audio name\" and when the pit crew guy talks to you via the radio he says your name.. I know that's really minor, and easy to do.. but its a nice touch and goes a long way towards immersion..\n\nSomething else I like is that it has a braking idiot light... The designers realized that they are simulating a very realistic sport, in an unrealistic medium and as such we as drivers have a hell of a lot of sensory information left completely out.. So knowing the proper time to brake for a sharp turn is often very hard to judge.. As such there is a little light in the lower left that will go green, yellow, red.. flash.. brake now you moron!!... etc.. I like that, but it needs to be right in the center of the screen.. Usually when amid 11 other cars all trying to get position and avoid crashing, its hard to notice..\n\nThe game does have an EXCELLENT multiplayer game..  Nothing more fun that doing race after race with other folks over the web.  The only real issue is that most people like running derby after derby and that gets told to me.. Also online game play being what it is, you do get quite a lot of douche bags who don't know how to do anything other than type \"fuck\" or \"nigger\" over and over again.. *sigh*  But so long as you can tune them out, its pretty fun.\n\nAt this point my only real complaint is that you MUST have a wheel.. trying to play this game with the keys (no mouse driving at all) is impossible or at least very hard with any accuracy.. (which makes sense.. I mean there is a good reason we drive with big analog wheels and not digital keys..)  So, having said that it's a completely invalid complaint but one that I figured I would voice.  I mean its a driving game after all, a wheel isn't out of the ordinary in the extremely rare situation of being in control of a car..\n\nWhen trying to drive with the keyboard the wheels, brakes and accelerator are either FULL ON, FULL OFF, FULL LEFT, or FULL RIGHT which makes for sporadic driving at best.\n\nI have 2 good wheels for my Playstation 2 but they don't use USB plugs so now I have to go buy a new wheel.. A little annoyed by that, but so be it.. I like racing games that much so I went out and got the R660 GT Motorsport racing wheel which I'll try to write a review about..  Some folks on the community grid forums can't get it to work with the game at all, but I'm having no troubles..\n\nWish list wise; I wish the game would actually make you pay for the damage you do to your car.. right now you can buy a 10 million dollar vehicle, total it.. and fixing it is free.. It shouldn't be.. but what can ya do.. this is really minor all things considered..\n\nThe reason this is important is because otherwise you can play the game as one bug crash derby and get away with it..\n\nI also wish you had more control over things like tire selection, engine tunings..etc.. That stuff is completely left out of the game.\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2008-08-12-knowledge-when-to-use-semicolon.md","url":"/knowledge-when-to-use-semicolon/","relative_path":"_posts/2008-08-12-knowledge-when-to-use-semicolon.md","id":"/knowledge-when-to-use-semicolon","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Knowledge: When to use semicolon.","layout":"post","tags":["Educational"],"image":"/images/2009/08/124211417018024.jpg","ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x2","private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-08-12 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"knowledge-when-to-use-semicolon","ext":".md"},"url":"/game-review-grid/","relative_path":"_posts/2008-09-02-game-review-grid.md","id":"/game-review-grid","collection":"posts","excerpt":"So, I have always liked racing games.

Sometimes, the second clause doesn't really look like a complete sentence, so you must watch closely.\n\n*Example:  Twelve workers started the project; only five remain.*\n\nThere is, however, one exception that can cause you a problem. You don't use a semicolon to connect two complete sentences if there's a conjunction between the clauses (and, but, etc.). In that case, use a comma.\n\n*Example:  This could be a complete sentence, and this could be another one.*\n\nAdding that single word, the conjunction \"and,\" means that you must change that semicolon into a comma.\n\n__To Serve as a Super-comma__\n\nWhen you have a series of three or more items that normally would be separated by commas except that each individual item already has a comma in it, you use the semicolon between items.\n\n*Example:  We visited Pago Pago, Western Samoa; Curitiba, Brazil; and St. George, Utah.*\n\n*Example:  The trio's birthdays are November 10, 1946; December 7, 1947; and October 31, 1950.*\n\n*Example:  Her favorite players are Steve Young, a quarterback; Jason Buck, a defensive end; and Ty Detmer, another quarterback.*\n\nAs in the examples above, citing places, dates, and people's names with descriptions, are three very common situations where you'll see the super-comma usage.\n\n__Minor Uses__\n\nA few relatively infrequent situations also call for a semicolon. When you list three or more items tacked onto the end of a complete sentence preceded by a connector word such as \"that is,\" \"for example,\" or \"for instance,\" you may use either a comma or a semicolon. Either of the following two example sentences is correct.\n\n*Example:  Be sure to watch out for grammar errors; for instance, comma splices, run-on sentences, and dangling modifiers.*\n\n*Example:  Be sure to watch out for grammar errors, for instance, comma splices, run-on sentences, and dangling modifiers.*\n\nYou may also use a semicolon to connect two otherwise complete sentences even if they are connected by a conjunction, if the first sentence already has one or more commas in it. It's optional, but may on occasion make the sentence more understandable.\n\n*Example:  When I eat alone, I leave a mess; but that's not the worst of it.*\n\nBoth the minor uses noted above are optional, so if you can remember only the first two situations above, you'll never go wrong by putting a semicolon where it doesn't belong.\n","previous":{"next":{"path":"_posts/2008-08-12-knowledge-when-to-use-semicolon.md","url":"/knowledge-when-to-use-semicolon/","relative_path":"_posts/2008-08-12-knowledge-when-to-use-semicolon.md","id":"/knowledge-when-to-use-semicolon","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Knowledge: When to use semicolon.","layout":"post","tags":["Educational"],"image":"/images/2009/08/124211417018024.jpg","ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x2","private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-08-12 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"knowledge-when-to-use-semicolon","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2008-08-12-i-hate-airplanes.md","output":null,"content":"<a href='/images/2008/08/airplanecockpit.jpg' rel='lightbox' class=\"fancybox\"><img class=\"pull-right\" title=\"737 700 cockpit\" src=\"/images/2008/08/airplanecockpit-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>\n\n__Update__:  On my layover in Baltimore my coworker and I were the only two left on the plane for more than thirty minutes.

Mmm maybe..   I'm an avid MMO player and ever since Cryptic first announced City of Heroes back in 2002(?) I was in love with the idea of a super hero MMO.   It really seems that all modern MMO's are fantasy based, and I have said for a while that I'm pretty fantasy-ed out.\n\nCryptic had sold CoH to the masses as this do anything engine that would mirror \"Champions\" the role playing game, without actually saying the word champions.   And to be honest, it turned out to be much less than champions.   Still a good game, but not the freeform system that everyone envisioned.  Lots of work and updates went into the game and it's still pretty fun.  I still play it.\n\nIn November of 2007 Cryptic sold their ownership of the CoH and City of Villains franchise to NCSoft so that they could work on their new super secret project!\n\nEnter, the real <a href=\"http://www.champions-online.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Champions Online</a>.  Everyone kind of assumed that the super secret project that Cryptic was working on was Champions Online.  I don't know this for sure, but I get the impression that they were trying to get the Champions Intellectual Property license for a long time -- like even back while working on CoH.  They didn't get it until recently,  once they got it they dropped CoH like a bad habit.\n\nThe Champions Online website was pretty lack luster to be fair and in all honesty the game as awhole looks like nothing but CoH 2.0.   I'm okay with that -- I think that the City of Heroes game is a great game with a lot of casual game play, and a lot of hidden depth as well for the hard core gamer..    So seeing them simply move forward with what City of Heroes is, but meld it a bit to make it more Champions like with new and improved, safe for carpets hotness..\n\nOh man that'd be great!  Having said that, the Champions Online website had a count down clock that finally counted down just the other day.  Most of us expected a new video, graphics, eyecandy or someting.. But I doubt anyone expected, what we got..\n\n<a href=\"http://www.startrekonline.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Star trek online's</a> website went live..  Cryptic got the Star Trek IP!!    So.. what that means is that Cryptic is doing two major MMO franchises at once!     Ugh..\n\nThis sorta seems bad to me.  Firstly, Star Trek seems to have a bit of a curse associated with it..  And now they are saying they are going to do both Star Trek AND Champions Online at the same time? Hrmmm This is worrisome.. I fear that this means we are going to get 2 bad games..  Bad for business, bad for the customers.. just.. bad.\n","previous":{"next":{"path":"_posts/2008-07-28-cryptic-studios.md","url":"/cryptic-studios/","relative_path":"_posts/2008-07-28-cryptic-studios.md","id":"/cryptic-studios","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Cryptic Studios","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-07-28 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"cryptic-studios","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2008-07-26-warhammer-and-warhammer-online.md","output":null,"content":"<img class=\"pull-right\" title=\"runtherd\" src=\"/images/2008/07/runtherd.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" />\n\nI play Warhammer 40k and Warhammer Fantasy table top games.  I also used to play the Warhammer fantasy role playing game when I was in highschool..  Right now I'm doing my damnedest to assemble and paint models for my new Warhammer 40k Orks Army.\n\nI love those little green bastards but I have a billion of them to paint.. (Okay, a billion might be a bit of an exaggeration, but not by much.)   Over the years I have had Necron, Tau and Orks as my 40K armies, and Orcs &amp; Goblins, Skaven and Tomb Kings as my Fantasy armies.   I played the role playing game for years and really preferred it to D&amp;D or any of the other traditional role playing systems..\n\nI tell you this so that you will come away with the understanding that I have a pretty good idea about the Warhammer universe and to convey to you how absolutely excited I was about <a href=\"http://www.warhammeronline.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Warhammer Online, Age of Reckoning</a>.   I had long thought this universe was ripe for computer games.\n\nI was proven right when Blizzard pretty much raped the Warhammer universe for all of it's games -- but that's for another post..\n\nNeedless to say, after doing a lot of looking, I'm a little disappointed in the direction the Warhammer Online game is taking.  Firstly, it looks terrible.  The graphics look extremely \"<a href=\"http://mythicmktg.fileburst.com/war/us/home/flash/2008_03_VotM.html\" target=\"_blank\">Last Generation</a>\" in my mind.  My first thought was, wow.. it looks like Dark Age of Camelot.   I then learned it was being put out by the original DAOC creators.. that gave me a chuckle, and worried me.   If their mark was to make a game that from launch looks 4 or 5 years old, then kudos boys, ya did it.   If you're intent was to make a modern looking game then you failed.\n\nIt has a wonderful <a href=\"http://mythicmktg.fileburst.com/war/us/home/flash/flash-cinematic.html\" target=\"_blank\">Cinematic Trailer</a> but that doesn't tell you anything about the game play -- and that trailer is over 2 years old at this point..\n\nIt really looks like they are trying to duplicate Blizzards World of Warcraft art style, all the while blizzard is basically using clones of their intellectual property..  It's just sad.   Especially considering one of the Q and A presenters when asked how they would deal with competition like World of Warcraft responded, \"Kill them!\"   But.. you're imitating them.. OH.. I see.. kill them, then you can say what you're doing is original.. Got it.\n\nMore over in the modern era of dual and quad core machines they are intentionally keeping the system spec's dreadfully low.  They haven't released the system requirements yet, but I bet you I could play it on my phone..  It doesn't look any more advanced than Everquest 1 was..   To be honest, World of Warcraft actually looks a little better..  (I shun myself for saying that.. )  The Beta footage of Warhammer Online looks extremely lack-luster.    They are talking about not wanting to make users need \"liquid cooled super computers\", but from the looks of it don't come anywhere near close to that.  They may be very high poly count models, but they use the blizzard art style and thus they all look flat with sharp corners in an almost cartoon style.\n\nDuring the Q and A session one of the devs was bragging about how he plays it on his old laptop and has zero problems..  *sigh*   I can't help but feel the game industry is going the wrong way here..  This is yet another case of \"Blizzard did it so, it must be right!\"   I'm not saying go extreme high graphics like Crysis or Vanguard, just more than WoW cartoon blockiness.\n\nThey claim to be looking to the future, but it doesn't appear that's the case with regards to the LOOK of the game.  Now I will be the first to stand up and say that game play ALWAYS comes first.. But why start with it looking old and outdated?\n\nI do appreciate that they are looking to the future with content though.. they have 2 years of content planned to include the first 2 major patches, as well as being in planning and pre-production of the first expansion.. that's nice..  That usually means they have budgeted it and that the game wont be here today, gone tomorrow.   But, When do we get a graphics update?  (Even World of Warcraft desperately needs one at this point and is my major sticking point with Wow.  I hate the look.)\n\nThey are all proud about how their game doesn't start until you have gotten to the end of your leveling.  Meaning, you play the game from 1 to 50 and at 50 the game \"really starts\".  They tout that as being original and exciting when that's EXACTLY what World of Warcraft does, the WoW game doesn't start until you get to 70..  Period.   All the grind to get there has nothing to do with WoW..  Its actually true of most games..\n\nThey are excited about all their \"unique\" advancement systems, but none of them sound unique.  WoW gives you all the armor stuff, EQ1/EQ2/WoW gives you the alternate advancements and traits..  D&amp;D Online gives you stat advancements.. City of Heroes gives you the badges, awards and trophies.. etc..   It's been done.  Move on.\n\nAnd what the hell, if you want to customize the look of your character above the standard 2 or 3 sliders you have to buy the special copy of the game?!  Fuck you!  That's just asinine and is the first HUGE red flag for me.  Talk about nickel and diming the hell out of people..   I can't think of anything that will make me not want to play the game more than being forced to play the same looking toon someone else plays  simply because I didn't want to fork over the extra $40 to get the \"special\" edition of the game.  I want to be able to customize and I should be able to using the standard edition of the game.\n\nIt really seems the ONLY thing that Warhammer online has going for it is the realm versus realm, and player versus player game play.  To be honest, I could give a crap about that.  I didn't enjoy it in DAOC, and I don't know that I'll enjoy it here.  From what I can see, it doesn't look like they have any end game PVE?! Are you kidding me?  Of all the shit to NOT copy from WoW or EQ, you miss this one?\n\nIn the end, if I wanted to play world of warcraft, I'd play world of warcraft -- if I wanted to play DAOC, I'd play DAOC.  I have yet to see anything that makes this game stand apart from blizzards blatant IP theft of the Warhammer Universe or DAOC.\n\nThis game seems like nothing but DAOC 2 using the Warhammer IP.  And that's sad, it could have been so much more.  Games Workshop, you should hang your head.\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2008-07-17-dr-horribles-sing-along-blog.md","url":"/dr-horribles-sing-along-blog/","relative_path":"_posts/2008-07-17-dr-horribles-sing-along-blog.md","id":"/dr-horribles-sing-along-blog","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2008/07/drhorriblesvertical.gif","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-07-17 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"dr-horribles-sing-along-blog","ext":".md"},"url":"/warhammer-and-warhammer-online/","relative_path":"_posts/2008-07-26-warhammer-and-warhammer-online.md","id":"/warhammer-and-warhammer-online","collection":"posts","excerpt":"I play Warhammer 40k and Warhammer Fantasy table top games.
