I thought he was making some reference to \"tanking\" in World of Warcraft or something..  But no, he was serious..\n\nWho on Earth would name their game this?!  Well.. Apparently Wargaming.net and BigWorld Technology that's who..\n\nWorld of Tanks is a real first person shooter style game currently in open beta in which you get to drive tanks, tank destoyers and/or self propelled guns around fairly large maps all with the goal of mass destruction, mayhem and general killing of your fellow man.  Booyah!  Who wouldn't like that right?\n\nI have to admit, its a lot of fun but has a lot of flaws that I'm concerned about..  But first the good!\n\nThey have a LOT of tanks.  Light, Medium, Heavy, Tank Destroyers of every flavor and even Artillery if that's your speed..  You're thrust on to one of a dozen or more (not sure how many all told) maps with 15 people per side and you fight it out until your team is the last standing..\n\nYou can currently choose from Russian, German and USA when buying your tanks and you're never restricted to a side.  You can easily go up the Russian tech tree and the German tech tree at the same time.  By the time of release they have stated that they will have fleshed out the USA tree (its kinda broken at the moment and missing tank destroyers entirely), as well as adding French and Japanese tanks.  I even heard rumor of British.. Awesome..\n\nIt's a lot of fun, and I liken it to a really slow first person shooter..  Unlike most FPS style games you go go go, but you have no choice but to go slower in this game as tanks don't move that fast, barrels are slow to traverse, reload times are slow..etc..  And if you do manage to get in a light tank and zip up to the front line you're likely to die very quickly as.. well.. light tanks are light for a reason..   So you have to play this game kinda slowly and carefully.. That's appealing..\n\nThe games themselves are usually 5 to 15 minutes long and can never go beyond 15 minutes, plus if you do die early you can always bail on that game to start up another one while waiting for that game to finish.. So you're never just sitting there waiting for the next round like some FPS games..  If at the end of 15 minutes there isn't a resolution (all dead on one side or the flag is captured) then it's a draw.  I have played over 300 games and this has happened once.\n\nThe objects on the terrain are completely destructible.. (for the most part)  Don't like that house in your way?  Drive through it!! Or shoot it.. And it's free to play!!  Even after release they have a free to play model but it will be slow going for you.. but still free is good..\n\nBut.. now we get to the bad.. You see the game has a lot of problems too that are starting to effect my fun:\n\n__Completely Silent Devs__:  As with any game, the developers are non-existent.  We hear nothing as players and all our pleas, prayers and questions go unanswered.   This is the unfortunate trend in the gaming industry that has been going on for years and all it does is piss off customers.  Mums the word and that blows.\n\nThey also appear to have an extremely slow development cycle or their iterations are very long as patches seem to come rather infrequently.. If ever..\n\n__Zero Control__:  Currently there is absolutely no way to choose which map you want to play on.  When you queue for a battle you're thrown into the first available \"room\" with a random group of people in random vehicles, on a random map.  Okay Fight! This sucks and leads to a lot of issues where you're in a room with people that have tanks 4 and 5 tiers above yours.   Many times have I felt like I brought a bb-gun to a bazooka-fest because I happened to be in my T3 tank going against t8 behemoths..\n\nI want to be able to to decide what vehicle I'm in for what map.  If I'm in a heavy city fight, I don't want to bring artillery..etc..   I want to be able to switch guns to suit the situation and you just can't, you have to make due with whatever you're given.\n\nI want to be able to see who/what is queueing so that I can decide to stay or go.. If I know I'm not going to be effective in a battle due to being in too small a kit then I need the ability to opt-out.  But you can't, you're in it for the fight until your tank gets turned into a smoking hole.. and it will..  This isn't fun..\n\n__Physics Model__:  The game has a very poor if non-existent physics model, as such it's possible sometimes to hang a tank off a cliff and fire down the slope in such a way as to defy gravity..  In reality the tank would take a tumble.. This is silly and makes it impossible in some cases to be safe down a hill from someone.  Where as you should be safe because they can't dip their gun low enough.. but.. no.\n\n__Graphics Engine__:  The graphics engine itself is a tad dated.. It's not bad looking by any stretch of the meaning, but it's not the most modern thing either, add to that the pretty bad memory leak issues they can't seem to plug and things start to fall apart fairly quickly.. Frustrating having to restart the client every hour or so..\n\n__Damage Model__:  There seems to be some pretty big issues with the damage model right now too..  Huge tanks firing Volkswagen sized shells at smaller tanks quite often do no damage what so ever.. This is frustrating and leads to a lot of odd damage issues where you should be able to kill a tank 2 or 3 tiers your junior but can't because for some reason they are impenetrable..  This is frustrating as hell..\n\n__Tank Tracks__:  It seems that the tank tracks for any given vehicle are made of papier-mâché in that if you even bump another tank the damn things fall off and you have to just sit there and wait for your crew to fix it..  This is extremely annoying to say the least..\n\n__Line of Sight__:  Easily the biggest issue though is the line of sight system they have implemented by which tanks constantly just up and vanish..  Unlike other first person shooters where people are always rendered as they run around the map and you have to spot them yourself.. this game has opted for a weird system by which enemy tanks are completely invisible (read: not rendered by the graphics engine) if your \"crew can't see them\"..\n\nTHIS SUCKS.  This sucks because half the time you could be and often are a very short distance from an enemy tank that you would otherwise absolutely see.. but just doesn't get rendered.. At all.  Until suddenly POP! There he is!  And it seems to be completely random for each individual..\n\nSo, for you the enemy tank is invisible.. But for him he sees you just fine, and is shooting you..  So you're dying but you can't see the enemy tank that's shooting you mere feet away because your crew has their heads up their asses..\n\nThis is an absolute game breaker!  They have to fix this or the game will be doomed to fail.  And such an easy fix too!  Render everyone, all the time.  Done.\n\n__Grouping__:  The game is \"free to play\" and as such anyone can download it and get in but in order to group up with a friend you have to have paid for the \"Premium\" access.  This sucks as it doesn't allow players to introduce a friend to it for free.. This is dumb of them, they need to allow anyone to group, free player or paid player.\n\n__Not an MMO__: They tout the game as an MMO but it's very much not.  It's more along the lines of \"Counterstrike with Tanks\".  The largest battle you can have (the only battle you can have at this time) is a 15 on 15 battle, and 30 people aint massive.  It's just a FPS, most FPS games are pay-once/play free games.   This game smacks of a company trying to get people to pay a monthly subscription for a really small amount of content that other games give away for free.  Imagine if Counterstrike, or Call of Duty tried to charge a monthly fee..\n\n__Match Making__:  The match making system is broken right now in that I'm currently, as I type this, in a game where a tier 3 vehicle is on the same map as a tier 9 vehicle..  That's completely silly as the tier 3 Marder can't do anything to a tier 9 IS-4..\n\nI mean come on, that's not even remotely fair to the Marder player..  The biggest gun the Marder can fit fires an average pen of 158 points of damage using the expensive ammo that costs real money (118 for the free stuff that people are actually using) where as the armor on the IS-4 is 160..  So the Marder actually can't do anything against this tank..    I'm pretty sure the Marder player didn't join the game in the hopes of being cannon fodder..\n\nThe match tier range needs to be limited to one or two levels at most.. 3 at the absolute outside.. otherwise you end up with a bunch of folks on the map who can't contribute to the match at all, but count as slots for that team.   Whats more is we have that one tier 3, and two tier 4s on our team where as the opposite team's lowest tiered tank is a tier 6..   Guess which side won..\n\n__Balance__:  I realize fully that due to the sheer volume of different tanks and vehicles its going to be near impossible to balance the tanks.  And at some point you have to accept that certain tanks suck when compared directly with other specific tanks..etc..  But it really seems that all of the American tanks, suck horribly.. Where as all of the Russian tanks are pure liquid awesome..  And it's a Russian made game.. Hmmmm..\n\nIt's telling when the biggest gun my American tier 6 heavy can fit is a 76mm gun that does an average damage of 115 points, and the Russian tier 6 heavy can fit a 152mm gun that does 700 points!!!!!!   I mean come on!  That's not even subtle, it's to the point of being silly.. (Note: this gun is often called the \"derp gun\" in game cause its just stupid..)\n\nIt may be completely realistic and historically accurate (American tanks during this period did very much suck..)but at some point \"fun\" has to step in and be the guide..  This isn't a tank simulator and isn't meant to be..\n\n__Pay-to-Win__:  The other issue I fear for is the Free-to-play model that they are employing..  The economic model they have chosen to use is confusing and messy.  There are multiple types of money to be used, money you buy and money you earn. You can convert money you buy into money you earn but both are used to buy things.  Some objects in the store are purchased with the earned money, some with the purchased money.  Experience is the same way in that there is earned experience for a given thing, and free experience that you can use on anything.  You can of course convert experience on a given thing to free experience but it costs money that you purchase.. etc..\n\nIt's confusing to a new player even though I understand it now it still boggles a little. I honestly don't know why they didnt just go to one type of money, one type of experience.. Done.   And to boot the cost for the gold money that you buy is too high compared to what you get, as well as them gouging you to convert experience to free experience.. it's almost like they see that as a cash cow and are trying like hell to get folks to fork over the $$$..\n\nPlus now they have added things like special tanks and ammo that you can purchase, and while it's kind of expensive it's nearly twice as good as the free stuff..  So sure, it's free to play but you're extremely gimped if you don't pony up the cash..  Paid (Premium) players get 50% more experience, access to WAY better ammo and tanks as well as gear and experienced crew..etc.. basically they have tried to monetize the game into a pay-to-win model where by the player who buys the most stuff will win every time.   Not cool.\n\nOkay enough.. you get the idea.. And having said all that, I still like the game.. It's still fun!  But I wonder how much of that is just due to a novelty value of getting to drive around in tanks and blow shit up..\n\nI just don't see how it's going to hold peoples attention in the long run.  The issues are out weighing the fun slowly.  The line of sight issue is easily the biggest with people just popping into and out of existence.. they have to get that one fixed or this game will be DOA..\n\nMy biggest concern at this point is that I just don't see how they are going to get all the issues fixed in time for their release at the beginning of next month.\n","collection":"posts","url":"/game-review-world-of-tanks-beta/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2011-03-06-game-review-night-sky.md","collection":"posts","url":"/game-review-night-sky/","path":"_posts/2011-03-06-game-review-night-sky.md","id":"/game-review-night-sky","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Game Review: Night Sky","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2011/03/nicalis-nightsky-pc-ss-01.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2011-03-06 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"game-review-night-sky","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2011-02-21-game-review-world-of-tanks-beta.md","excerpt":"When I heard a buddy of mine tell me that he was playing a game called \"World of Tanks\" I thought he was kidding..

Ugh.. Seriously?!   My Desktop resolution is 5520x1200..  This game looks like a postage stamp by comparison forcing me to play it in the full screen mode which jacks up my other two monitors..  I really don't like this and seems an odd choice all things considered.\n\nThat's it!  There it is.. the only complaint I can find..   If you read my game reviews I can always find a lot of things to complain about.. but I got nothing else..\n\nAll in all I give this game a 4.5 out of 5 and say get it!  It's a lot of fun and considering how small a team put it together they deserve the money.  Yet another perfect example of how simple elegant game play will win over big budget massive game every time.  Take note big developers, game play wins!\n\nTo Nicklas Nygren and the <a href=\"http://nifflas.ni2.se/\" target=\"_blank\">Nifflas</a> crew I say thanks a lot!  This is a keeper..\n\n","collection":"posts","url":"/game-review-night-sky/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2011-03-06-game-review-night-sky.md","collection":"posts","url":"/game-review-night-sky/","path":"_posts/2011-03-06-game-review-night-sky.md","id":"/game-review-night-sky","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Game Review: Night Sky","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2011/03/nicalis-nightsky-pc-ss-01.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2011-03-06 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"game-review-night-sky","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2011-03-13-grid-computing-and-boinc.md","content":"<a href=\"http://boincstats.com/stats/boinc_user_graph.php?pr=bo&amp;id=05439a7a6a0f2499a04b1da317b68e1d\" target=\"_blank\" class='pull-right'><img title=\"BOINC Stats\" src=\"http://www.boincstats.com/signature/user_238192.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"325\" height=\"173\" /><br /><span>My BOINC Stats</span></a>\n\nI really like the idea of community computing, or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grid_computing\" target=\"_blank\">grid computing</a>..  I've always thought it was a damn good idea and I always try to leave one running. I mean think about all the wasted computer cycles that your machine could be using to do good things with when you're not around.\n\nEspecially if you set it up to be completely invisible like I do..  I never know its running because I have it setup to run only when my machine is idle, and I disable the screen saver portion of it in favor of just showing a blank screen.  Doing it this way I have generated over a hundred thousand points and turned in a lot of good results for them to chew on and I never even noticed.  Yay doing my part, by doing nothing.  Seriously it costs me nothing; why not?\n\nThe down side of my method is that it's so invisible that I didn't notice it hadn't been running for the last couple months.  I forgot to reinstall it when I formatted and reinstalled windows.  Woops.\n\nSo today I got BOINC reinstalled and set back up the way I like it and it's now chewing away at the bigger problems of life, the universe and everything.\n\nAnd since some will be curious, I typically do some World Community Grid projects (Help Conquer Cancer, Human Proteome Folding, FightAIDS@Home, Genome Comparison..etc), SETI@home Einstein@home, Docking@home and the MilkyWay@home stuff.  (See the graphic above)\n\nI have used the Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) since 2004.  And I used a very scientific method for picking it; It was the first one I heard of and it was the one doing SETI@Home.  Okay not so scientific but it's served me well (or rather I have served it well) for a while and I hope it's doing some good.\n\nNow-a-days, one of my main requirements is that they use the CPU and GPU to calculate results.   It seems right now the GPU calculation stuff is a tad underdeveloped or at least you have poor control over it.  I have two GPU's in my machine, but it only uses one.  Or says it only uses one, who knows how many it actually uses.  But one is better than none.  The Nvidia CUDA core calculations are way faster than CPU only.. like 10x faster..  If you don't use the GPU you're wasting your time.\n\nThis got me to thinking, are there better grid systems out there?   Do some deserve our computer cycles more than another?   Why?   What do you use?    Do you have a grid machine setup?  Why not?  I honestly can't think of a down side...

I mean think about all the wasted computer cycles that your machine could be using to do good things with when you're not around.\n\nEspecially if you set it up to be completely invisible like I do..  I never know its running because I have it setup to run only when my machine is idle, and I disable the screen saver portion of it in favor of just showing a blank screen.  Doing it this way I have generated over a hundred thousand points and turned in a lot of good results for them to chew on and I never even noticed.  Yay doing my part, by doing nothing.  Seriously it costs me nothing; why not?\n\nThe down side of my method is that it's so invisible that I didn't notice it hadn't been running for the last couple months.  I forgot to reinstall it when I formatted and reinstalled windows.  Woops.\n\nSo today I got BOINC reinstalled and set back up the way I like it and it's now chewing away at the bigger problems of life, the universe and everything.\n\nAnd since some will be curious, I typically do some World Community Grid projects (Help Conquer Cancer, Human Proteome Folding, FightAIDS@Home, Genome Comparison..etc), SETI@home Einstein@home, Docking@home and the MilkyWay@home stuff.  (See the graphic above)\n\nI have used the Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) since 2004.  And I used a very scientific method for picking it; It was the first one I heard of and it was the one doing SETI@Home.  Okay not so scientific but it's served me well (or rather I have served it well) for a while and I hope it's doing some good.\n\nNow-a-days, one of my main requirements is that they use the CPU and GPU to calculate results.   It seems right now the GPU calculation stuff is a tad underdeveloped or at least you have poor control over it.  I have two GPU's in my machine, but it only uses one.  Or says it only uses one, who knows how many it actually uses.  But one is better than none.  The Nvidia CUDA core calculations are way faster than CPU only.. like 10x faster..  If you don't use the GPU you're wasting your time.\n\nThis got me to thinking, are there better grid systems out there?   Do some deserve our computer cycles more than another?   Why?   What do you use?    Do you have a grid machine setup?  Why not?  I honestly can't think of a down side... Can you?\n\nOkay that's not true, I guess the major down side is your computer is always hyperactive.  It's never \"at rest\".  But is that a problem?  Computers aren't like people in that they don't rest.  A CPU using 10% of its processing power is effectively the same as a CPU using 100% of its processing power in all ways except one;  Heat.\n\nSo a computer that's chewing away at @Home stuff is going to be hotter than an idle machine.  And there will be a slight spike in bandwidth when transferring the files back and forth, but its hardly worth mentioning as these files are tiny.   So that's the two \"major\" downsides I can think of.\n\nThoughts?\n\nEdit: I swear to god I had more points than this at one time..

Now suddenly that didn't seem like such a bad idea, as Dragon Age II (DA2) the supposed successor, was rushed out the door in just over 8 months and it shows.  DA2 just doesn't compare to Dragon Age - Origins (DA:O).\n\nNow I realize that I'm giving the impression that I didn't think DA2 was a good game, that's not the case.. I think it was a good game by itself, but it just didn't meet up with the expectations nor match the precedent that was set with DA:O.\n\nSo, I want to say that Yes, DA2 is a good game on its own merits.   But if you go in expecting DA:O version two, you're going to be disappointed.\n\nThe thing I liked about DA:O was that it was an epic game, and epic in it's story telling.  They did an excellent job in making the player feel like he was a part of a bigger world.   The game itself was fricken huge, with a lot of unique areas and places to go, things to see.. monsters to kill.. And there wasn't a lot of repeating of those areas.\n\nOne of the biggest issues with DA2 is they constantly reused the same dungeon, cave, map over and over just blocking off areas to keep you from going there this time..  This gets old fast and the 10th time I went into a random cave only to be on the same map I have done previously, I got kinda fed up.  This was a really cheap way to reuse content and the game suffered a lot for it.   Take a couple extra months and give us more areas so we aren't constantly walking in our own footsteps..\n\nI did very much like how they told the story through the dwarf character, I thought that was quite clever indeed.. But it never \"drew me in\".  I don't really know why but I never really felt like I was part of the story, just an outside observer of it..\n\nPlus they completely removed the customizability of the previous game with regards to gear and equipping your secondary characters, or even for your main character to have a secondary slot of weapons.. These things were staples of the first game, gone in the second.  Why?\n\nStability wise I think they missed the mark too as the game crashes on me quite a lot.  Of my friends though, apparently I am the only person that this happens to so I'm willing to accept that it's me or my hardware.\n\nGraphics and engine wise the game is as good as the first one, with the only notable difference is how you interact with your characters.   You can interact with your character more like a MMO than like the first game and that's a good thing, though it may be playing a big role in how different the game feels.\n\nThings that are better than the first game;\n\nThe Tactic System -- The tactic system got better, thank you very much Bioware.  Huge points from me there.  However you still don't have a \"reset\" tactic that can be used to turn stuff off when combat ends.   Still its better than the first game for sure and your characters seem to be smarter about following them.  I pretty much automated my characters completely and only played my main toon which was the whole point.  Every once in a while I had to actually pause the game and redirect, but for the most part that wasn't necessary.   In the first game I pretty much paused every other second to redirect someone.\n\nThe Difficulty --  The game is actually fricken hard, when you play it on hard.   The first game I played on hard the first time through and impossible on the second time through without too much trouble.  This game, even hard is too dang hard.  That's a good thing!  Hard should be hard.\n\nRanged Rogues -- Ranged rogues don't suck!  YAY!  Bows in the old game and ranged attacks in general were completely worthless..  The new game, not so much.. in fact not at all!  Thank you for this.\n\nMagic -- Magic in general seems much more impressive.  It not only does more damage but it does it with style.\n\netc..  Lots of little things that they did do better..  It's just the feeling of the game is less epic.. Less grand..  Comparing it to another favorite franchise; Mass Effect 2 was a far better game than Mass Effect.   Dragon Age 2 wasn't far better than Dragon Age - Origins.   It was just different...\n\nI feel like if you loved Origins, you'll hate DA2 or not really identify with it as much.  Where as if you really didn't get into Origins, you'll love DA2.\n\nSo it may be unfair to say that Bioware did wrong with DA2.  I just was expecting something different than I got..  I haven't quite finished the game yet, I'll knock it out and get back to you.\n","collection":"posts","url":"/game-review-dragon-age-ii/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2011-03-15-game-review-dragon-age-ii.md","collection":"posts","url":"/game-review-dragon-age-ii/","path":"_posts/2011-03-15-game-review-dragon-age-ii.md","id":"/game-review-dragon-age-ii","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Game Review: Dragon Age II","layout":"post","tags":["Bioware","Review"],"image":"/images/2011/03/Dragon-Age-2-Wallpaper.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2011-03-15 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"game-review-dragon-age-ii","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2011-04-10-car-computers.md","content":"<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2011/04/DSH-039-2.jpg\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"MP3Car DSH-039-2\" src=\"/images/2011/04/DSH-039-2-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"MP3Car DSH-039-2\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>MP3Car DSH-039-2</span></a>\n\nI have a <a title=\"Mercedes-Benz CLK350\" href=\"/mercedes-benz-clk350/\">Mercedes CLK 350</a> and it's a pretty good car.   I'm fairly happy with it, but frankly I feel that the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comand_APS\" target=\"_blank\">Mercedes COMAND</a> system sucks and has to go..  Okay maybe \"has to go\" is a bit harsh, but it's sub par to be sure.   I have seen other systems in other vehicles and I think most of them are better, if not perfect either. I believe that this particular system is in prime need of replacement and I have to wonder how hard that would be..  Plus if I'm unhappy with it others likely are too, or they are unhappy with their vehicles system and want a replacement..\n\nThis seems like a vacuum that needs to be filled.  A perfect environment for some clever folks to create maybe an open source product based on some free OS that you can install tools on to do what you want.. etc..  Even a \"marketplace\" like system that allows for custom apps to be installed..  Maybe android or linux based that would customize itself to he specific vehicle.. etc..  God that'd be awesome..\n\nYou'd need an inexpensive <a href=\"http://store.mp3car.com/Habey_BIS_6620_I_Intel_Embedded_Z510_Based_Ultra_L_p/ccc-212.htm\" target=\"_blank\">mini car computer</a> that you could use for those vehicles that don't have a system in need of replacement, but think of the market!  Think of the number of vehicles on the road today in America and around the world that you could be selling to..\n\nEither way, during my research I found a dashboard replacement for my cars computer at <a href=\"http://store.mp3car.com/Direct_Fit_Double_Din_LCD_Touch_Screen_for_2005_M_p/dsh-039.htm\" target=\"_blank\">MP3Car.com</a>.  That and the mini-computer from above and.. I think we have a real possibility here!\n\nThe main issue is that I'm not sure that just uninstalling the computer that's currently in there is a good idea or even an option as the entire car depends on it.  This thing is not just your media player, but its also the navigation system, settings, phone, etc..  It IS the car in many ways.  Replacement may not be an option..  Hell even setting the cars clock as to be done through this system..  Plus the LCD in the center of the console near my speedometer is controlled by it too!\n\nIt'd be a hell of a lot of work to get this thing installed and make sure that all the functionality that is currently there, is put back.. I know we could do better eventually but the car would likely be undrivable for a while..   Still it's a cool idea..\n","collection":"posts","url":"/car-computers/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2011-05-22-su-152-tank-destroyer.md","collection":"posts","url":"/su-152-tank-destroyer/","path":"_posts/2011-05-22-su-152-tank-destroyer.md","id":"/su-152-tank-destroyer","draft":false,"categories":["Hobbies"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"SU-152 Tank Destroyer","layout":"post","tags":["3D Graphics","Tank"],"image":"/images/2011/05/SU152-hour17-18.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2011-05-22 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"su-152-tank-destroyer","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2011-04-10-car-computers.md","excerpt":"I have a Mercedes CLK 350 and it's a pretty good car.   I'm fairly happy with it, but frankly I feel that the Mercedes COMAND system sucks and has to go..  Okay maybe \"has to go\" is a bit harsh, but it's sub par to be sure.","id":"/car-computers","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Replacing my cars computer with my own...","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2011/04/DSH-039-2.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2011-04-10 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"car-computers","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2011-03-15-game-review-dragon-age-ii.md","excerpt":"So in my original Dragon Age review I began by asking \"Can Bioware do no wrong?\"   Apparently the answer is \"Yes.\"","id":"/game-review-dragon-age-ii","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Game Review: Dragon Age II","layout":"post","tags":["Bioware","Review"],"image":"/images/2011/03/Dragon-Age-2-Wallpaper.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2011-03-15 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"game-review-dragon-age-ii","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2011-03-13-grid-computing-and-boinc.md","excerpt":"I really like the idea of community computing, or grid computing..  I've always thought it was a damn good idea and I always try to leave one running.","id":"/grid-computing-and-boinc","draft":false,"categories":["Hobbies","Software Development"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Grid Computing and BOINC","layout":"post","tags":["Boinc"],"image":"http://www.boincstats.com/signature/user_238192.gif","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2011-03-13 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"grid-computing-and-boinc","ext":".md"}
