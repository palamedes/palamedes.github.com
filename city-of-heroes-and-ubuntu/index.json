When I was in middle and high school I was in band and played everything from the trombone to the baritone and tuba but my musical aspirations sorta died there.   So it's not that I don't have skill, or that I can't learn -- I just haven't.   I know many folks that are completely tone deaf, I'm not one of those.  I just haven't had the time/inclination to invest into learning a musical instrument.\n\nMy lack of musical skills came gallingly apparent one year at Halloween when everyone in the company showed up playing some instrument or another -- and I had nothing of the sort.  One of the co-workers asked with complete honesty and earnest, \"What instrument do you play?\" as if it were a foregone conclusion that I had to play something..\n\nMy response was, \"I can play the radio..\"  Which got a chuckle from everyone who heard it, but it left me a little hollow inside.  I really do want to learn something I just am not sure what.  Or rather, I wasn't.\n\nFirstly, why did the aspirations die?   Well band in middle school was something we did to get the required credit and to avoid any sort of P.E. ~ I'm lazy and playing an instrument sounded a lot more fun that running laps around a track.  And while it filled that need nicely, it really did nothing to foster musical desires or competency on my part and I largely didn't enjoy it..\n\nI think the primary reason for my lack of enthusiasm was that I wanted to play the saxophone, but was assigned the trombone.  Back then the players had virtually NO choice..  Had I showed up with a sax of my own and could form the correct embouchure I'm sure I would have been a shoe in, but since we didn't own a sax and I had no clue what an <a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/embouchure\" target=\"_blank\">embouchure</a> was;  I wasn't even remotely in the running for the job.  I was handed a trombone and told to go sit down -- I made do.  But I didn't like it.\n\nI enjoyed the baritone more, but didn't get to play it for long before they decided they needed me carrying the sousaphone around.  That effectively ended my band career in my mind.   I quit the band and spent the next 4 years swimming on the swim team.. Hey at least I wasn't running laps ~ just swimming them.  Low impact I tell ya! (trying to put a positive spin on it)\n\nSo whats changed?  Well.. Nothing.  I still don't play anything and really would like to.  It's something that I want to get into as a hobby.  Just something I can piddle around with.\n\nPart of the issue is my other major hobby is software engineering -- programming.  I very much enjoy programming and it's something I do often, but it's also what I do for a living.  And nothing will rob you of a hobby more than being forced to do it.\n\nSo I need a new hobby.  My usual waste of time comes in the form of playing games, but that's still massive amounts of time with 'ass in chair' really not expanding my horizons.. Playing games is fine and all but it doesn't broaden the mind much.  Entertaining, sure.. Growth educing, not so much..\n\nSo this has made me want to look at musical instruments again.  I have always had a fondness for music and really would like to learn to make my own.  When I listen to music I often imagine myself playing the instruments and what that must feel like..\n\n<img class=\"pull-right\" title=\"Yamaha s90\" src=\"/images/2008/07/s90.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" />I thought for a long time that I'd like to learn to play the piano, and even got one.  I have a very nice <a href=\"http://www.yamaha.com/yamahavgn/CDA/ContentDetail/ModelSeriesDetail/0,,CNTID%25253D2709%252526CTID%25253D206500%252526CNTYP%25253DPRODUCT,00.html\" target=\"_blank\">Yamaha S90</a> piano that I really have never learned to use.\n\nIt's an excellent piano with all manner of very nice bells and whistles, but for what ever reason it didn't inspire me like I thought it would.\n\nI tried, and had a friend start to teach me but it just didn't do anything for me.  It was a bit daunting of course because of all the various buttons, dials and widgets but so long as you just focused on the piano keys themselves it was fine.  It played nicely as far as I could tell but I really didn't get much out of it.   I certainly didn't do it any justice and at this point its a shame the machine isn't being better used.  I don't feel it was too hard for me, it just didn't inspire me.\n\nI still very much like the idea of learning to play the piano but it still doesn't grip me like I thought it would.  I think each person to their instrument and this one simply isn't mine.\n\nFor a long time I wanted to learn to play the guitar and that still entertains me to some degree but no more so than the piano.  I know several folks who play the guitar and even dated a woman many years ago who was into it..  Classical acoustic guitar sounded very warm and soulful and I think would be a lot of fun to play.  I may still get one at some point, but it doesn't really drag me away from my other hobbies right now.\n\nI was digging around on the internet when I stumbled across the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapman_Stick\" target=\"_blank\">Chapman Stick</a> being played by <a href=\"http://myspace.com/robmartino\" target=\"_blank\">Rob Martino</a> in his song <a href=\"http://youtube.com/watch?v=_JjimMO2SdE\" target=\"_blank\">\"One Cloud\" on You Tube</a>..  Nice job Rob.  Well done my friend.\n\nThis instrument has been around since the mid 70's but is completely new to me.  I never new it existed until recently (a couple months ago now).  When I saw Rob playing it though I immediately recognized it as a \"Baliset\" which I thought was a completely fictional instrument played by Gurney Halleck (Patrick Stuart) in David Lynch's move Dune.\n\nThis was a favorite movie of mine when I was a younger man and so I had seen the Baliset scene many times. So, I was stunned to find that the Baliset was a real instrument, sorta.\n\nI've been looking into this for a couple months now and the chapman stick really kind of speaks to me.  One thing I like about it is that, from everything I have read it is the perfect amalgamation of keyboard and guitar -- in one.\n\nI am going to keep looking into it, but I think I'd like to learn to play one.   So far from what I have seen they are brutally expensive.. but I have a nice keyboard I can sell in order to get one, or atleast part way to one.\n\nI have read a couple folks say that learning the guitar first is good, while others say because of the \"free hands\" tap method used to play it learning the guitar first is actually a hindrance..   I don't know of course.. and comments are welcome..\n\nI'm going to keep looking into it though.. I have nothing but time so this is no rush.. but I think I'd like to learn the stick.  Getting setup with one might be the hard part.. but eventually..\n\nIf not the stick then something else.. I know that most of this is likely a pipedream, but I want to learn something.. I need to unplug a tad from all my gaming and programming ~ this seems a good direction..\n","collection":"posts","url":"/play-the-radio/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2008-07-13-ibm-agile.md","collection":"posts","url":"/ibm-agile/","path":"_posts/2008-07-13-ibm-agile.md","id":"/ibm-agile","draft":false,"categories":["Software Development"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"IBM and Agile Programming","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2008/07/ibm-logo-big-blue.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-07-13 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"ibm-agile","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2008-07-07-play-the-radio.md","excerpt":"... and that's about it.

Work has been on endless \"crunch\" period which promises to continue in this vein for the time being.  It's not fun.  In fact, I'm a little burned out -- No big deal though.. these things tend to cure themselves after a time..\n\nIt's just that some of the stuff I'm working on has the \"too little, too late\" feel to it that I can't really explain.  Plus I'm worried that it's something that doesn't bring value to the customer -- which believe it or not, and despite what my manager thinks.. I actually care about.\n\nThe part of the product I'm currently work in is \"reporting\" and its a HUGE job.  Bigger than most realize -- though I was told yesterday by one of the technical writers than she had no clue how big it was.. haha\n\nI have basically been tasked with completely rewriting the user interface for the reporting side of the product in a very short period of time.  It took 2 years to get into the state its in today (A buggy and often incomplete state) and they gave me 90 days to fix it.   I failed.\n\nIt just wasn't enough time.  I'm still working on it and everyone has been understanding about it, but I still hate that I wasn't able to get it on time.\n\nI often blame IBM for the endless meetings and other time wasters for this failure, but in all truth it was just too much work.. I bit off more than I could chew.. Though the time wasters might have been a factor;\n\nOur last couple of work days involved a two day class on \"agile programming\".  And while I agree with the message of the class, the class itself wasn't very good.  Primarily because you had a bunch of non-programmer bureaucrats  telling us how we should do our job.  More over, I kind of got that one of the leading messages they were shilling was that metrics driven product development was a mistake.. all the while giving us a brand new set of metrics to use..  And doing so in a \"touchy feely, every one get up and do this goofy activity\" sort of way.\n\nMore over, I feel that most of their message would have been better delivered to the upper management instead of us.  As programmers, we just need to know when, where and how.. The why of it can be kept to a 30 minute meeting..  2 whole days seemed wasteful..  Just my opinion of course, so it's worth pretty much nothing.\n\nThe whole class was full of trendy keywords like scrum, stand-ups, sprint backlog, stakeholders, and burn down.. when I thought they could have just used plain words to get basic concepts across..  It really smacked of red tape to be honest..\n\nWhat amuses me the most is the fact that the agile programming method isn't vastly different from what we were doing at BuildForge prior to IBM buying the company -- we just didn't have a trendy name for it.\n\nAll and all though I think agile is a good idea, and it certainly will help in the future but does nothing for us in the here and now.\n\nCertainly doesn't help me make up for the missed deadline..\n","collection":"posts","url":"/ibm-agile/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2008-07-13-ibm-agile.md","collection":"posts","url":"/ibm-agile/","path":"_posts/2008-07-13-ibm-agile.md","id":"/ibm-agile","draft":false,"categories":["Software Development"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"IBM and Agile Programming","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2008/07/ibm-logo-big-blue.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-07-13 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"ibm-agile","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2008-07-14-city-of-heroes-and-ubuntu.md","content":"<img class=\"pull-right\" title=\"City of Heroes\" src=\"/images/2008/06/cohgamebox-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" />\n\nI have been playing the hell out of City of Heroes over the last month or two.

LEGEN-DARY!  (er.. sorry.. wrong show)..  Joss Whedon put together this little internet mini-series during the writers strike and its really very good.\n\nIt stars Neil Patrick Harris (commonly known as Doogie Howser) as Dr. Horrible, Nathan Fillion (Malcom Reynolds or the wrong private Ryan) as Captain Hammer (\"Corporate Tool\" hehe), and Felicia Day (Buffy, and The Guild) as Penny, Dr. Horribles love interest.  It's spread out over 3 episodes spanning a grand total of about 40 minutes..\n\nIn an attempt to test the waters, joss and crew have decided to release this pony for free over the course of the next couple of days, then to offer it for sale.  One week only!!  Posted initially on the 15th, they stay free until the 20th then go for sale..  I love this idea.. One week, get the word out.. then see who comes and buys it.  I would.. its good!\n\nIn fact, I'm stunned at how good it is.. hehe I shouldn't be, I mean Joss is great -- just watch firefly, serenity, buffy..etc.. (Damn you fox!)  But this is a good little show..  I wish it were longer.. (Sorta like Firefly.. But I digress..)\n\nI love musicals.. I dunno why.. I know its not manly, I don't care.  I really enjoy them and when they are comical, they are even better.   This was a fantastic show with just the right amount of music.. More over they were all really well done!\n\nAnd while I do like Nathan Fillion, I think Neil Patrick Harris completely stole the show.  He was great!  He makes me want to be in the Evil League of Evil!  I had no idea he could sing! It was fun seeing Simon Helberg show up as \"Moist\"..heh  I'm enjoying him on Big Bang Theory.. (did he do your piano work?)\n\nNathan's \"Moral dilemma\" song (end of act 2) was fantastic and probably my favorite.  The end of act 1 song was good too..  Oh and Joss, Loved the chair.. heh  I also really loved the whole bad horse stuff.. that was funny as hell..\n\nThis whole thing was done on a shoe string budget but you wouldn't know to look at it.  I mean the camera work looked great, the lighting and sound were fine.  More over they got excellent talent and whoever wrote the songs was great!  Lots of counterpoint which was fun.\n\nVery well done though guys.. kudos!  I wish it was longer than 3 episodes -- BALLS!\n\nOn a side note, I'd love to see numbers as to how much this actually cost.  Down to equipment, stars, etc.. maybe show us the original script etc..  Really use this as a lesson to the \"fan films\" and Amateur films community to show us really how its done.  That sort of thing would be of interest to everyone and I think they'd pay to see the 'behind the scenes' stuff..  I know I would.\n","collection":"posts","url":"/dr-horribles-sing-along-blog/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2008-07-17-dr-horribles-sing-along-blog.md","collection":"posts","url":"/dr-horribles-sing-along-blog/","path":"_posts/2008-07-17-dr-horribles-sing-along-blog.md","id":"/dr-horribles-sing-along-blog","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2008/07/drhorriblesvertical.gif","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-07-17 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"dr-horribles-sing-along-blog","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2008-07-26-warhammer-and-warhammer-online.md","content":"<img class=\"pull-right\" title=\"runtherd\" src=\"/images/2008/07/runtherd.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" />\n\nI play Warhammer 40k and Warhammer Fantasy table top games.  I also used to play the Warhammer fantasy role playing game when I was in highschool..  Right now I'm doing my damnedest to assemble and paint models for my new Warhammer 40k Orks Army.\n\nI love those little green bastards but I have a billion of them to paint.. (Okay, a billion might be a bit of an exaggeration, but not by much.)   Over the years I have had Necron, Tau and Orks as my 40K armies, and Orcs &amp; Goblins, Skaven and Tomb Kings as my Fantasy armies.   I played the role playing game for years and really preferred it to D&amp;D or any of the other traditional role playing systems..\n\nI tell you this so that you will come away with the understanding that I have a pretty good idea about the Warhammer universe and to convey to you how absolutely excited I was about <a href=\"http://www.warhammeronline.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Warhammer Online, Age of Reckoning</a>.   I had long thought this universe was ripe for computer games.\n\nI was proven right when Blizzard pretty much raped the Warhammer universe for all of it's games -- but that's for another post..\n\nNeedless to say, after doing a lot of looking, I'm a little disappointed in the direction the Warhammer Online game is taking.  Firstly, it looks terrible.  The graphics look extremely \"<a href=\"http://mythicmktg.fileburst.com/war/us/home/flash/2008_03_VotM.html\" target=\"_blank\">Last Generation</a>\" in my mind.  My first thought was, wow.. it looks like Dark Age of Camelot.   I then learned it was being put out by the original DAOC creators.. that gave me a chuckle, and worried me.   If their mark was to make a game that from launch looks 4 or 5 years old, then kudos boys, ya did it.   If you're intent was to make a modern looking game then you failed.\n\nIt has a wonderful <a href=\"http://mythicmktg.fileburst.com/war/us/home/flash/flash-cinematic.html\" target=\"_blank\">Cinematic Trailer</a> but that doesn't tell you anything about the game play -- and that trailer is over 2 years old at this point..\n\nIt really looks like they are trying to duplicate Blizzards World of Warcraft art style, all the while blizzard is basically using clones of their intellectual property..  It's just sad.   Especially considering one of the Q and A presenters when asked how they would deal with competition like World of Warcraft responded, \"Kill them!\"   But.. you're imitating them.. OH.. I see.. kill them, then you can say what you're doing is original.. Got it.\n\nMore over in the modern era of dual and quad core machines they are intentionally keeping the system spec's dreadfully low.  They haven't released the system requirements yet, but I bet you I could play it on my phone..  It doesn't look any more advanced than Everquest 1 was..   To be honest, World of Warcraft actually looks a little better..  (I shun myself for saying that.. )  The Beta footage of Warhammer Online looks extremely lack-luster.    They are talking about not wanting to make users need \"liquid cooled super computers\", but from the looks of it don't come anywhere near close to that.  They may be very high poly count models, but they use the blizzard art style and thus they all look flat with sharp corners in an almost cartoon style.\n\nDuring the Q and A session one of the devs was bragging about how he plays it on his old laptop and has zero problems..  *sigh*   I can't help but feel the game industry is going the wrong way here..  This is yet another case of \"Blizzard did it so, it must be right!\"   I'm not saying go extreme high graphics like Crysis or Vanguard, just more than WoW cartoon blockiness.\n\nThey claim to be looking to the future, but it doesn't appear that's the case with regards to the LOOK of the game.  Now I will be the first to stand up and say that game play ALWAYS comes first.. But why start with it looking old and outdated?\n\nI do appreciate that they are looking to the future with content though.. they have 2 years of content planned to include the first 2 major patches, as well as being in planning and pre-production of the first expansion.. that's nice..  That usually means they have budgeted it and that the game wont be here today, gone tomorrow.   But, When do we get a graphics update?  (Even World of Warcraft desperately needs one at this point and is my major sticking point with Wow.  I hate the look.)\n\nThey are all proud about how their game doesn't start until you have gotten to the end of your leveling.  Meaning, you play the game from 1 to 50 and at 50 the game \"really starts\".  They tout that as being original and exciting when that's EXACTLY what World of Warcraft does, the WoW game doesn't start until you get to 70..  Period.   All the grind to get there has nothing to do with WoW..  Its actually true of most games..\n\nThey are excited about all their \"unique\" advancement systems, but none of them sound unique.  WoW gives you all the armor stuff, EQ1/EQ2/WoW gives you the alternate advancements and traits..  D&amp;D Online gives you stat advancements.. City of Heroes gives you the badges, awards and trophies.. etc..   It's been done.  Move on.\n\nAnd what the hell, if you want to customize the look of your character above the standard 2 or 3 sliders you have to buy the special copy of the game?!  Fuck you!  That's just asinine and is the first HUGE red flag for me.  Talk about nickel and diming the hell out of people..   I can't think of anything that will make me not want to play the game more than being forced to play the same looking toon someone else plays  simply because I didn't want to fork over the extra $40 to get the \"special\" edition of the game.  I want to be able to customize and I should be able to using the standard edition of the game.\n\nIt really seems the ONLY thing that Warhammer online has going for it is the realm versus realm, and player versus player game play.  To be honest, I could give a crap about that.  I didn't enjoy it in DAOC, and I don't know that I'll enjoy it here.  From what I can see, it doesn't look like they have any end game PVE?! Are you kidding me?  Of all the shit to NOT copy from WoW or EQ, you miss this one?\n\nIn the end, if I wanted to play world of warcraft, I'd play world of warcraft -- if I wanted to play DAOC, I'd play DAOC.  I have yet to see anything that makes this game stand apart from blizzards blatant IP theft of the Warhammer Universe or DAOC.\n\nThis game seems like nothing but DAOC 2 using the Warhammer IP.  And that's sad, it could have been so much more.  Games Workshop, you should hang your head.\n","collection":"posts","url":"/warhammer-and-warhammer-online/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2008-07-28-cryptic-studios.md","collection":"posts","url":"/cryptic-studios/","path":"_posts/2008-07-28-cryptic-studios.md","id":"/cryptic-studios","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Cryptic Studios","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-07-28 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"cryptic-studios","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2008-07-26-warhammer-and-warhammer-online.md","excerpt":"I play Warhammer 40k and Warhammer Fantasy table top games.
