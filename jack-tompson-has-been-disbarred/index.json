I played the hell out of that game..hehe\n\nThe games of his that I enjoy most are the business simulation games revolving around the rail roads.  Specifically the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railroad_Tycoon\" target=\"_blank\">Railroad Tycoon</a> games.   I have played all three and I enjoyed them very much.  It's been years, of course since the last game came out and thus the whole genre sort of fell off my radar.\n\nI was watching the history channel the other night when they were talking about railroads and steam engines and was reminded of the good ol'days of Tycoon'ing and thought I would check out the franchise to see whats happened in the intervening years.  Needless to say I was stoked when I saw a new addition.\n\nI hopped on to <a href=\"http://www.direct2drive.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Direct2Drive</a> and picked up a copy of  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sid_Meier%27s_Railroads!\" target=\"_blank\">Sid Meier's Railroads!</a> for the low price of $19.\n\nI must admit -- I'm disappointed.  The game was billed as the sequal to Tycoon 3 and I say pshaw!   It's no such thing.  While very pretty, it's extremely simplified.  They removed all the stuff that people enjoy with business simulations.. like.. I dunno.. the business..and managing that business..\n\nThis game is almost juvenile in it's game play in that you don't have to do anything.. just lay track between two points, throw down a train slap on some cars.. leave the room.  The game does everything else.  Usually poorly.\n\nThe train routing is just awful!  One of the things I enjoyed about the old games was the designing of the track layout and then routing trains in such a way to take advantage of that.  The new game has 100% automated train routing and it's just bad.  The trains often will use the wrong set of track, no matter how many different routes you lay.  So you then have 2 trains head to head when there are 3 and 4 parallel tracks that one of them could have used.\n\nThe map is tiny!!  Remember the days of laying track from New York to LA?  Gone.  The new maps are a tiny portion of any given land mass..\n\nSimply put, Railroads! is very much the dumbed down and simplified version of Railroad Tycoon 3.   If you're looking for a good game for a kid then it's probably great.. but if you're looking for the challenge of complex economic cycles and rail road management... pass this one up and reload Tycoon 3.\n\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2008-12-22-wow134.md","url":"/wow134/","relative_path":"_posts/2008-12-22-wow134.md","id":"/wow134","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"World of Warcraft and Error #134","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-12-22 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"wow134","ext":".md"},"url":"/railroads/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-01-05-railroads.md","id":"/railroads","collection":"posts","excerpt":"I'm a bit of a Sid Meier's fan -- He will likely go down in history as the king of turn based strategy games with the introduction of the Civilization franchise in the early 1990's.","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Game Review: Railroads!","layout":"post","tags":["Reviews"],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-01-05 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"railroads","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2008-12-22-wow134.md","output":null,"content":"The Blue Mods at the Blizzard World of Warcraft forums asked me to post about my problems so I did... again..  Note; I have posted about this numerous times, and each time it gets buried and unanswered or simply ignored.   I'm sorta getting sick of it..

I just wish they would stop blaming me (and/or my computer) for it.\n\nTo date I have noticed two things that I think are important and that bear mentioning;\n\n1.  This only happens to me after I have been playing the game for a couple of hours (memory leak?)\n2.  This only happens to me when I am flying either on a flight path or on my own flying mount.\n\nIts always a ReadSectors/DecompressData error.\n\nThings I have tried and it still happened;\n\na. __New Drivers / Old Drivers__ -- I have updated every driver ont he system to the latest and even tried older ones..\n\nb. __Higher resolution / Lower resolution__ -- I have tried playing the game from 1680x1050 to 800x600 (this was painful) and it still happened.\n\nc. __High graphics / Low graphics__ -- I have played with Max graphics settings (to include forcing AA through my nvidia drivers) and I have played with everything turned down and off.\n\nd. __Lots of addons / No addons__ -- I have played the game with all my addons cranked up and going, and no addons.. Questhelper seemed to exacerbate the issue so I have removed it, but I dont think it was the problem as its been gone for a while and its still a problem.\n\ne. __Scan Disk and Defrag__ -- at this point my machines harddrive is probably tired of me doing this\n\nf. __Deleted the wtf files, cache folder and other various bits__ -- at this point there is nothing left of my install from when I originally had the problem. I have completely moved the install, its in a different place physically on the drive. I continue to do what others suggest via the forum and nothing seems to help.\n\ng. __Run the repair tool__ -- I do this every time it happens and it does fix the problem for a time. Note however that its only a temporary fix. It does happen again forcing me to rerun the tool. Sometimes its a quick fix (15 minutes or so) other times it says its \"really corrupt\" and has to restore from an older version or something.. then update via the patcher. this takes a while and sucks when I'm trying to do a 25man naxx..\n\n#### Computer information:\n\nBoard: EVGA 122-CK-NF68 running the Nvidia nForce 680i SLI SPP chipset\n\nProcessor: Intel Core 2 Extreme Quad Core Qx6700 @ 2666 Mhz\n\nMemory: 2048mb (2x1024 DDR2)..

The industry has decided that linear is out and that open ended randomness is in!  The issue being of course that it detracts from the over all story and game play something awful.. of course gameplay also appears to be out right now, so no big loss ... but I get ahead of myself..\n\nOver the weekend I picked up Farcry 2.  I wasn't on the original Farcry boat.. For whatever reason that game came and went long before I ever saw it.  When I finally did get my grubby hands on it, I had just played HL2 and was jonesing for some extra action.. needless to say it didn't do much for me..   But I could see the potential!  And certainly why it was thought of as awesome.. It was still pretty good for an older game..\n\nNow that Farcry 2 is out I was one of the first ones on the band wagon.  I downloaded the game from direct2drive and had it installed and playing in fairly short order.\n\nOnce I got the game installed I promptly... logged into World of Warcraft... my wife wanted me to play with her.  But once that was done I played some Farcry 2!\n\nThe initial opening sequences were pretty neat and the game looked like it had some promise in the vein of direction and fun.  Wow was I ever wrong.\n\nAfter several hours of game play I have a long list of complaints.  More over it's very obvious to me that they were more interested in making the game engine look pretty than making a game that is fun to play.\n\nIt really seems like the they were entirely too determined to make their game engine as pretty as the crysis engine, game play be damned.  And I believe they have done so, the graphics engine is wonderful guys, but so many of the other portions of the game lack.\n\nThe folks at UBI were all keen on making sure you knew this game was going for ultra realism!  And yet again, a long line of games have fallen far short of that goal.  I really wish they would stop trying.  Simulating realism in a game is impossible especially when the controls are a mouse and keyboard.\n\nOR a game pad controller which is exactly all they were aiming for.\n\nI really hate what console gaming is doing to the PC gaming market.  Trying to make 1 game that works 100% with PCs and Consoles is fine, but why do you make the PC gamers suffer with the limited controls?\n\n__Securom DRM__ -- Firstly a word about securom;  Farcry 2 uses the same shitty DRM model that spore uses, and just like spore and all other games that use it, only serves to piss off and thus on the legit users who actually bought the game.   I maintain that any user who was going to hack the game would hack it anyway and companies aren't making any money by adding all this anti-piracy code that intentionally rootkits legit users computers.   To the entire industry I say, fuck you.  Stop it!  You are only spending extra money on something that is only serving to kill your industry..  The bloody system was hacked weeks before you even brought it out..  So far the only people that your DRM is preventing from playing the game, are the ones that legitimately bought the game!   I don't know why I bother, this is yet another example of the game executives being fucking morons and refusing to listen to their customers.  Shocker.  The state of the PC gaming industry can be traced directly back to your poor decisions.\n\n__No Prone / No Lean__ -- I mean seriously.  Why can't I go prone or lean left / right around corners?  This is basic first person shooter 101 stuff and in the vein of realism seems kinda important..  the answer of course is because console gamers have no button for that.. so PC gamers must suffer too.. Serously lame.\n\n__Destructable Environments__ -- In the video and various other sources they talked about how the entire world would be destructable.. and nothing is.  You can shoot the hood off a car, or burn a building..etc..  Stuff will come flying at you etc.. but in the end the building is exactly as it was.   You can shoot the leaves off a bush, but not chop them off.. etc..   In the end nothing is really destructable.. Lame.\n\n__Somali's are uber!__ -- Why the hell does every 90lb Somali guy take 10 or 12 bullets to the chest before falling down?  ... only to get up and crawl away as if nothing happened.  I mean seriously these guys are fricken uber as hell..  It's rediculous how much damage they take before dying..  This is lame.\n\n__There he is! Get him!__ -- Every NPC in the game upon getting a glimps of you (oh and they WILL see you) just starts shooting.  No questions asked.  Why do they open fire on you no matter what?!  Do I have a big blinking sign \"bad guy here\" over my head?  This is lame as hell..\n\n__Windy as hell__ -- The realtree system that the engine employ's looks fantastic, but at one point the wind was blowing so damn hard it would have been a hurricane.. Huge thick trunked trees were whipping back and forth in such an unrealistic manner that it really detracted from the game..  Cap the winds guys..\n\n__Instant Respawn and drive times__ -- The game is massively open, and as such you have to drive from one point to another during missions.  It takes ages to get there and the vehicles drive like shit.  They very much feel like a cardboard box, not a real vehicle.  But fine, that can be forgiven.  More over, I'm okay with the openess of the game, but to keep things interesting they have placed ambush points in the form of guardposts on every fricken road between any two points.   In order to get to your mission you'll likely have to drive through 5 or 6 of them and it's a full on fight every time.   Which again, fine.    But they respawn to full strength pretty much instantly.    Why?!   Combine that with the fact that they are uber, nothing is destructable, they see you and open fire instantly..etc..  you get the point.\n\nFrankly it's just rediculous that they respawn so quickly, it's tedious and irritiating and servies no purpose but to piss me off.  The placed it there to keep the game from getting boring.. well this only exacerbated the problem not fix it.\n\nAll in all, the game kinda sucks.  It's not fun.  It's flat, lifeless and plainly dull because you end up having to do the same bullshit over and over again with out any real story or ties to some kind of story line.  It has none of the immersion that UBI claims is there.\n\nIn the end, I'm sadly disappointed.  I'll likely keep playing it a bit just to make sure, then ditch it for good.\n","previous":{"next":{"path":"_posts/2008-10-28-game-review-farcry-2.md","url":"/game-review-farcry-2/","relative_path":"_posts/2008-10-28-game-review-farcry-2.md","id":"/game-review-farcry-2","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Game Review: Farcry 2","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2008/10/farcry2pc-150x150.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-10-28 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"game-review-farcry-2","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2008-09-15-windows-xp-sp3-access-denied.md","output":null,"content":"<img class=\"pull-right\" title=\"software\" src=\"/images/2008/09/software.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"48\" height=\"48\" />\n\n<img title=\"updatesicon\" src=\"/images/2008/09/updatesicon.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"21\" height=\"18\" /> \"Updates are ready for your computer.  Click here to download these updates. \" But don't expect Windows XP to actually know how to install them.  I'm stunned by yet another sloppy piece of work by Microsoft.  This almost smacks of an intentional ploy on their part to say \"well if you just go to Vista this wont be a problem.\"\n\nSo, to sum up; Windows XP Service Pack 3, wont install unless you hack your into your registry.   That's the short of it.\n\nMicrosoft's official stance is to say that \"some programs change the system access control lists (SACL) in the Registry so that administrator accounts cannot alter them.

(I'm paraphrasing.)\n\nThey give instructions on how to fix it, then below the instructions they say that they aren't responsible if these instructions don't work.  Awesome..  Gotta love good customer support on top of a huge snafu.\n\nTo save you the trouble, here are the steps to fix it;\n\n* <a href=\"http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756/\" target=\"_blank\">Backup your registry.</a>\n* <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=e8ba3e56-d8fe-4a91-93cf-ed6985e3927b&amp;displaylang=en\" target=\"_blank\">Download Microsofts Subinacl.</a>\n* <a href=\"/images/2008/09/reset.cmd\" target=\"_blank\">Download this file and double click it.</a>\n* <a href=\"http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322389/\" target=\"_blank\">Install Service Pack 3 from the FULL install.</a>\n\nIt works.  Step 1 is vital just in case, 2 is a microsoft tool that enables the script that is step three.  Step three is just what passes for a shell script, feel free to read it via notepad.  Also, step three takes about 10 minutes to run so go have a coke and a smile.\n\n I had actually been considering installing Vista just to test out DX10 on a different partition, now screw that.  Install Vista? Accept/Deny... Denied.\n\nGame developers please.. start releasing your games for Linux..  Let's make Microsoft shape up or get the hell out of the market..\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2008-09-02-game-review-grid.md","url":"/game-review-grid/","relative_path":"_posts/2008-09-02-game-review-grid.md","id":"/game-review-grid","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Game Review: GRID","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2008/09/gridbox.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-09-02 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"game-review-grid","ext":".md"},"url":"/windows-xp-sp3-access-denied/","relative_path":"_posts/2008-09-15-windows-xp-sp3-access-denied.md","id":"/windows-xp-sp3-access-denied","collection":"posts","excerpt":" \"Updates are ready for your computer.  Click here to download these updates. \" But don't expect Windows XP to actually know how to install them.","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Windows XP Sp.3 ... \"Access Denied!\"","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2008/09/software.png","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-09-15 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"windows-xp-sp3-access-denied","ext":".md"},"url":"/game-review-farcry-2/","relative_path":"_posts/2008-10-28-game-review-farcry-2.md","id":"/game-review-farcry-2","collection":"posts","excerpt":"Open world game play is all the rage.
