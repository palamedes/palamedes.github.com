I started on the basic shape of the vehicle and had hoped to get a lot farther along than I did.\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2011/05/SU152-hour2.jpg\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"SU 152 -- Hour 2\" src=\"/images/2011/05/SU152-hour2-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"SU 152 -- Hour 2\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>SU 152 -- Hour 2</span></a>\n\n__Hour 2 -- Refine basic shape__\n\nThe second hour I spent getting the main body to match up with the backdrops and to get all the curvy bits to curve, and the straight bits to be straight.   The body you see is still synchronous along the x axis, but wont be for long.  Again I had hoped and planned to get more done in the second hour.\n\nThese hours are going by fast!  I wrote out a plan of what I thought I could get done in each hour and I'm failing to make the mark.\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2011/05/SU152-hour3.jpg\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"SU 152 -- Hour 3\" src=\"/images/2011/05/SU152-hour3-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"SU 152 -- Hour 3\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>SU 152 -- Hour 3</span></a>\n\n__Hour 3 -- Rear end work and beginnings of road wheel__\n\nWhile I added a lot of rear end basic shape, the majority of the work in this hour was on the beginnings of that roadwheel.\n\nThe reason I spent so much time on it is because its a 100% subpatch, where as the main body of the tank isn't at all.   This means the road wheel once done, is done.  Wont need to revisit it to get the detail out of it.  Even so again this hour flew by.\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2011/05/SU152-hour4.jpg\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"SU 152 -- Hour 4\" src=\"/images/2011/05/SU152-hour4-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"SU 152 -- Hour 4\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>SU 152 -- Hour 4</span></a>\n\n__Hour 4 -- Making the body 100% subdividable__\n\nOkay so the subdivision thing had to be resolved as it's unacceptable to me to model up something that can't be subdivided.  So with that, this hour was spent converting the entire tank body to sub-d.   This pretty much ends the synchronous body work as the details I start to add are all going to be off center one way or another.\n\nThis was an ugly sub-d conversion as I really was pressed for time, but it works and renders out nicely as you can see.\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2011/05/SU152-hour5.jpg\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"SU 152 -- Hour 5\" src=\"/images/2011/05/SU152-hour5-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"SU 152 -- Hour 5\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>SU 152 -- Hour 5</span></a>\n\n__Hour 5 -- More Roadwheel work__\n\nI spent this hour working on the road wheels.  The tracks are going to take the longest amount of time for sure, but I had hoped to have all of the road wheels done by this hour.  I had hour six set aside as the hour in which I would make the single track, and then in hour seven I'd get it correctly arrayed around the road wheels.\n\nWell at this point I don't have all the road wheels done.  I still have the six main road wheels, their spring assemblies, and the three return wheels to do.. =(\n\nIt's becoming increasingly evident that 10 hours will not be enough time at my skill level to get this thing done.   I'll likely release the 10hour model, then continue on with it and release more as I get more done.\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2011/05/SU152-hour6.jpg\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"SU 152 -- Hour 6\" src=\"/images/2011/05/SU152-hour6-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"SU 152 -- Hour 6\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>SU 152 -- Hour 6</span></a>\n\n__Hour 6 -- Even More Road Wheels!__\n\nI spent this hour adding the six primary road wheels to the model.  Thankfully, its the same road wheel cloned a bunch of times so not a lot of extra work was needed.. I just had to create one wheel.    Even so it took a long time to get it looking the way my plans show.. its actually a very detailed wheel..\n\nI still need to model up the linkages that go between the backs of the wheels and the hull, create the three return wheels and if I have time, add some of the details that are missing.\n\nOnce that's done.. Track!\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2011/05/SU152-hour7.jpg\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"SU 152 -- Hour 7\" src=\"/images/2011/05/SU152-hour7-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"SU 152 -- Hour 7\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>SU 152 -- Hour 7</span></a>\n\n__Hour 7 -- Road Wheel details and return wheels etc..__\n\nThis hour (which in all honesty was closer to an hour and a half) was spent getting all the road wheel details in place.. The wheel pistons, spring assemblies, and return wheels are all in now.\n\nAgain thankfully I only had to do each one time, then clone them over and over.   I also skimped a little on some of the details just due to time.  Like for example, none of the wheels are actually connected to anything.. They just kinda float there.. I'll get to that eventually, but so long as it doesn't show up in a render...\n\nIn hour 8 I hope to get the track done, leaving hour 9 and 10 for the body details and gun.\n\nNo way in hell I'm making it in 10 hours..\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2011/05/SU152-hour8-crash.jpg\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Modo CTD\" src=\"/images/2011/05/SU152-hour8-crash-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Modo CTD\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Modo CTD</span></a>\n\n__Hour 8 -- Crash To Desktop__\n\nI love Modo.  I really think its easily one of the best modeling packages out there, but its instability pisses me off..\n\nThe application just randomly crashes to desktop sometimes for no apparent reason.   In 301 I used to avoid certain tools cause they just about always caused a CTD, but in 401 its mind bogglingly random.  You can use the same tool a 100 times on the exact same model, and on the 101'st time it will crash.\n\nI end up saving my models quite often for fear that this will happen, cause I know it will.. I hate it..\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2011/05/SU152-hour8.jpg\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"SU 152 -- Hour 8\" src=\"/images/2011/05/SU152-hour8-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"SU 152 -- Hour 8\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>SU 152 -- Hour 8</span></a>\n\n__Hour 8 -- The real thing.. __\n\nOkay so after storming away from the computer in a fit of pique I came back and got back to working on what I was doing.  I was working on the roof doors and spring hatch assemblies.\n\nNot much for an hours worth of work I know.. The crash really took it out of me..\n\nHour 9 will be my finishing off the roof and rear nurnies/greebles and then save hour 10 for the main gun.\n\nI have accepted that there is no way I'm going to get the track on the tank within the 10 hours, so that will have to come at a later time. *sigh* sorry.\n\nEither way, at hour 10 I'll release a link to this model.\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2011/05/SU152-hour9.jpg\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"SU 152 -- Hour 9\" src=\"/images/2011/05/SU152-hour9-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"SU 152 -- Hour 9\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>SU 152 -- Hour 9</span></a>\n\n__Hour 9 -- Roof Nurnies and Greebles__\n\nI went as fast as I could to get all the little roof details in and it still took me an age.   Most likely, for a 10 hour project I am employing way too much detail.. I just don't know how else to do it..  The more I think about it the more I think that making extremely low poly models (for games and the like) is an art form that I'm not sure I'll ever master.  (Modo says I'm up to 2.6 million polygons.. The WOT game version probably has only a couple hundred.. )\n\nThe rear end of the vehicles is still entirely unfinished and that sucks.  I'll get to it, I wont let this one go unfinished as I am enjoying it but it wont happen in the 10 hours\n\nI will be using hour 10 to work on the gun.\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2011/05/SU152-hour10.jpg\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"SU 152 -- Hour 10\" src=\"/images/2011/05/SU152-hour10-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"SU 152 -- Hour 10\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>SU 152 -- Hour 10</span></a>\n\n__Hour 10 -- Gun!__\n\nWell I got as much done as I could in the short period of time that I had left for the main gun.. A lot is missing, and I'll have to get to it as I can.\n\nAll in all this has been a very good experience.. 10 hours is no where near enough time to do anything remotely close to a fully finished project.\n\nPlus, with the 2 CTD's that happened, setup, odd breaks and overages.. this 10 hours was likely more like 13 and that just wasn't enough..\n\nMy plan is to continue updating this guy and post the results here.\n\nBut as I promised above -- Here's the model -- SU152 at 10 hours in Modo format:   __<a href=\"/images/2011/05/SU152.zip\">SU152.zip</a>__\n\nI would ask that you please not directly link to that file on your sites, but rather host it yourself.  If too many people start linking it I'll be forced to remove it.\n\nUsage;  You're free to use this model in anyway you see fit so long as you please give credit where credit is due by mentioning my name {Jason ''Palamedes'' Ellis} and give me a link back to this page so that others can use the model too.\n\nAny and all comments are welcome..  Feel free to email me at;  <img class=\"alignnone\" src=\"/images/2008/06/email.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"146\" height=\"14\" />\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2011/05/SU152-hour11.jpg\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"SU 152 -- Hour 11\" src=\"/images/2011/05/SU152-hour11-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"SU 152 -- Hour 11\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>SU 152 -- Hour 11</span></a>\n\n*__And so it continues! __*\n\n__Hour 11 -- Chin!__\n\nSo I have gotten over my disappointment at not being able to finish the model in the alloted time period and continued to work on it.  During this hour I added the \"chin\" stuff that sits under the gun mantle.\n\nI wont be updating the downloadable model on the site every time I do work.. But I will update it every couple of hours or as I see fit.\n\nAlso I might stretch the hours in to two or three hour sessions instead of a single hour in an attempt to get more done.  One hour is a very short amount of time and passes very quickly.\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2011/05/SU152-hour12-16.jpg\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"SU 152 -- Tracks\" src=\"/images/2011/05/SU152-hour12-16-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"SU 152 -- Tracks\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>SU 152 -- Tracks</span></a>\n\n__Hour 12 through 16 -- Tracks!__\n\nOkay here you see the rear sprocket with 4 tracks wrapping around it..  I'm embarrassed at how many hours I have spent on not only modeling up a single track foot but also getting it correctly sized such that it can  actually articulate around the road wheels and sprockets.\n\nI'm still no where near done.  There is no thickness to the tracks right now at all and I don't have any pictures of the inside of the tracks, so I'm going to have to kind of make up some of that.\n\nThis is also a really bad render.. sorry about that..   Either way I'll get it done and on the model so that it looks good eventually.. I like where I am headed with it finally, its just taking a long time..  Each track tread (foot? shoe?) has a lot of curves to it for traction that I want to get right..

Now suddenly that didn't seem like such a bad idea, as Dragon Age II (DA2) the supposed successor, was rushed out the door in just over 8 months and it shows.  DA2 just doesn't compare to Dragon Age - Origins (DA:O).\n\nNow I realize that I'm giving the impression that I didn't think DA2 was a good game, that's not the case.. I think it was a good game by itself, but it just didn't meet up with the expectations nor match the precedent that was set with DA:O.\n\nSo, I want to say that Yes, DA2 is a good game on its own merits.   But if you go in expecting DA:O version two, you're going to be disappointed.\n\nThe thing I liked about DA:O was that it was an epic game, and epic in it's story telling.  They did an excellent job in making the player feel like he was a part of a bigger world.   The game itself was fricken huge, with a lot of unique areas and places to go, things to see.. monsters to kill.. And there wasn't a lot of repeating of those areas.\n\nOne of the biggest issues with DA2 is they constantly reused the same dungeon, cave, map over and over just blocking off areas to keep you from going there this time..  This gets old fast and the 10th time I went into a random cave only to be on the same map I have done previously, I got kinda fed up.  This was a really cheap way to reuse content and the game suffered a lot for it.   Take a couple extra months and give us more areas so we aren't constantly walking in our own footsteps..\n\nI did very much like how they told the story through the dwarf character, I thought that was quite clever indeed.. But it never \"drew me in\".  I don't really know why but I never really felt like I was part of the story, just an outside observer of it..\n\nPlus they completely removed the customizability of the previous game with regards to gear and equipping your secondary characters, or even for your main character to have a secondary slot of weapons.. These things were staples of the first game, gone in the second.  Why?\n\nStability wise I think they missed the mark too as the game crashes on me quite a lot.  Of my friends though, apparently I am the only person that this happens to so I'm willing to accept that it's me or my hardware.\n\nGraphics and engine wise the game is as good as the first one, with the only notable difference is how you interact with your characters.   You can interact with your character more like a MMO than like the first game and that's a good thing, though it may be playing a big role in how different the game feels.\n\nThings that are better than the first game;\n\nThe Tactic System -- The tactic system got better, thank you very much Bioware.  Huge points from me there.  However you still don't have a \"reset\" tactic that can be used to turn stuff off when combat ends.   Still its better than the first game for sure and your characters seem to be smarter about following them.  I pretty much automated my characters completely and only played my main toon which was the whole point.  Every once in a while I had to actually pause the game and redirect, but for the most part that wasn't necessary.   In the first game I pretty much paused every other second to redirect someone.\n\nThe Difficulty --  The game is actually fricken hard, when you play it on hard.   The first game I played on hard the first time through and impossible on the second time through without too much trouble.  This game, even hard is too dang hard.  That's a good thing!  Hard should be hard.\n\nRanged Rogues -- Ranged rogues don't suck!  YAY!  Bows in the old game and ranged attacks in general were completely worthless..  The new game, not so much.. in fact not at all!  Thank you for this.\n\nMagic -- Magic in general seems much more impressive.  It not only does more damage but it does it with style.\n\netc..  Lots of little things that they did do better..  It's just the feeling of the game is less epic.. Less grand..  Comparing it to another favorite franchise; Mass Effect 2 was a far better game than Mass Effect.   Dragon Age 2 wasn't far better than Dragon Age - Origins.   It was just different...\n\nI feel like if you loved Origins, you'll hate DA2 or not really identify with it as much.  Where as if you really didn't get into Origins, you'll love DA2.\n\nSo it may be unfair to say that Bioware did wrong with DA2.  I just was expecting something different than I got..  I haven't quite finished the game yet, I'll knock it out and get back to you.\n","previous":{"next":{"path":"_posts/2011-03-15-game-review-dragon-age-ii.md","url":"/game-review-dragon-age-ii/","relative_path":"_posts/2011-03-15-game-review-dragon-age-ii.md","id":"/game-review-dragon-age-ii","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Game Review: Dragon Age II","layout":"post","tags":["Bioware","Review"],"image":"/images/2011/03/Dragon-Age-2-Wallpaper.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2011-03-15 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"game-review-dragon-age-ii","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2011-03-13-grid-computing-and-boinc.md","output":null,"content":"<a href=\"http://boincstats.com/stats/boinc_user_graph.php?pr=bo&amp;id=05439a7a6a0f2499a04b1da317b68e1d\" target=\"_blank\" class='pull-right'><img title=\"BOINC Stats\" src=\"http://www.boincstats.com/signature/user_238192.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"325\" height=\"173\" /><br /><span>My BOINC Stats</span></a>\n\nI really like the idea of community computing, or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grid_computing\" target=\"_blank\">grid computing</a>..  I've always thought it was a damn good idea and I always try to leave one running. I mean think about all the wasted computer cycles that your machine could be using to do good things with when you're not around.\n\nEspecially if you set it up to be completely invisible like I do..  I never know its running because I have it setup to run only when my machine is idle, and I disable the screen saver portion of it in favor of just showing a blank screen.  Doing it this way I have generated over a hundred thousand points and turned in a lot of good results for them to chew on and I never even noticed.  Yay doing my part, by doing nothing.  Seriously it costs me nothing; why not?\n\nThe down side of my method is that it's so invisible that I didn't notice it hadn't been running for the last couple months.  I forgot to reinstall it when I formatted and reinstalled windows.  Woops.\n\nSo today I got BOINC reinstalled and set back up the way I like it and it's now chewing away at the bigger problems of life, the universe and everything.\n\nAnd since some will be curious, I typically do some World Community Grid projects (Help Conquer Cancer, Human Proteome Folding, FightAIDS@Home, Genome Comparison..etc), SETI@home Einstein@home, Docking@home and the MilkyWay@home stuff.  (See the graphic above)\n\nI have used the Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) since 2004.  And I used a very scientific method for picking it; It was the first one I heard of and it was the one doing SETI@Home.  Okay not so scientific but it's served me well (or rather I have served it well) for a while and I hope it's doing some good.\n\nNow-a-days, one of my main requirements is that they use the CPU and GPU to calculate results.   It seems right now the GPU calculation stuff is a tad underdeveloped or at least you have poor control over it.  I have two GPU's in my machine, but it only uses one.  Or says it only uses one, who knows how many it actually uses.  But one is better than none.  The Nvidia CUDA core calculations are way faster than CPU only.. like 10x faster..  If you don't use the GPU you're wasting your time.\n\nThis got me to thinking, are there better grid systems out there?   Do some deserve our computer cycles more than another?   Why?   What do you use?    Do you have a grid machine setup?  Why not?  I honestly can't think of a down side... Can you?\n\nOkay that's not true, I guess the major down side is your computer is always hyperactive.  It's never \"at rest\".  But is that a problem?  Computers aren't like people in that they don't rest.  A CPU using 10% of its processing power is effectively the same as a CPU using 100% of its processing power in all ways except one;  Heat.\n\nSo a computer that's chewing away at @Home stuff is going to be hotter than an idle machine.  And there will be a slight spike in bandwidth when transferring the files back and forth, but its hardly worth mentioning as these files are tiny.   So that's the two \"major\" downsides I can think of.\n\nThoughts?\n\nEdit: I swear to god I had more points than this at one time.. Either I used a different login at some point in the past, or something got erased..  Oh well.. It's not about the points..\n\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2011-03-06-game-review-night-sky.md","url":"/game-review-night-sky/","relative_path":"_posts/2011-03-06-game-review-night-sky.md","id":"/game-review-night-sky","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Game Review: Night Sky","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2011/03/nicalis-nightsky-pc-ss-01.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2011-03-06 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"game-review-night-sky","ext":".md"},"url":"/grid-computing-and-boinc/","relative_path":"_posts/2011-03-13-grid-computing-and-boinc.md","id":"/grid-computing-and-boinc","collection":"posts","excerpt":"I really like the idea of community computing, or grid computing..  I've always thought it was a damn good idea and I always try to leave one running.","draft":false,"categories":["Hobbies","Software Development"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Grid Computing and BOINC","layout":"post","tags":["Boinc"],"image":"http://www.boincstats.com/signature/user_238192.gif","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2011-03-13 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"grid-computing-and-boinc","ext":".md"},"url":"/game-review-dragon-age-ii/","relative_path":"_posts/2011-03-15-game-review-dragon-age-ii.md","id":"/game-review-dragon-age-ii","collection":"posts","excerpt":"So in my original Dragon Age review I began by asking \"Can Bioware do no wrong?\"   Apparently the answer is \"Yes.\"","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Game Review: Dragon Age II","layout":"post","tags":["Bioware","Review"],"image":"/images/2011/03/Dragon-Age-2-Wallpaper.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2011-03-15 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"game-review-dragon-age-ii","ext":".md"},"url":"/car-computers/","relative_path":"_posts/2011-04-10-car-computers.md","id":"/car-computers","collection":"posts","excerpt":"I have a Mercedes CLK 350 and it's a pretty good car.   I'm fairly happy with it, but frankly I feel that the Mercedes COMAND system sucks and has to go..  Okay maybe \"has to go\" is a bit harsh, but it's sub par to be sure.","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Replacing my cars computer with my own...","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2011/04/DSH-039-2.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2011-04-10 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"car-computers","ext":".md"}
