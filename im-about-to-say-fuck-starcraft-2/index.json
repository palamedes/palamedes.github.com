I have refined the hull shape a lot so that now the top deck area is actually the shape it should be for holding the conning tower and what not.  But more importantly I have actually added those side bulges to the model such that they are part of the main layer and can be subdivided nicely.  No more having one model poke through another model.  Ding! \"You have gained a level!\"\n\nIt may sound like a simple thing but it's actually complex if you're coming from hard body modeling to subdivision modeling.\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2010/01/type-vii-03.jpg\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img src=\"/images/2010/01/type-vii-03-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Front Wire Cutters</span></a>\n\n__+3 hours - Front wire cutters__ - So I spent the better part of these three hours getting the front wire cutters (I guess that's what they are) looking right under subd and making sure they smoothly transitioned into the rest of the mesh.  Good times.  It took longer than I wanted because I had some serious symmetry issues that I wasn't sure how to sort out.  Thankfully, Modo has a Symmetry tool that does it all for you!  It's just magic.. No clue how the hell that works.\n\nI have also been researching what I want the top part of the boat to look like.. I wanted to keep the boat as accurate as possible and my research has lead me to believe that every fricken one of these boats was different..  For some reason I had it in my mind that manufacturing back then would be similar to how it is today.. But I guess I have to keep in mind that these things were built one at a time and each one was hand crafted.. So they tend to be a tad different from one another..\n\nThe more I work on this the more I think I would really like to visit a real one of these if for no other reason than to just gawk at it..\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2010/01/type-vii-04.jpg\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"type-vii-04\" src=\"/images/2010/01/type-vii-04-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Conning Tower</span></a>\n\n__+ 5 hours - The beginnings of a conning tower __- I started and restarted this conning tower probably 10 times and even now I'm not 100% happy with it.   I kept going back and forth with the design as well as the number of tiers it would have.  This one has 2 which means this is a type VII-C or later as it will have two flak guns as opposed to only one.\n\nIt's been hard to find plans with anything close to this so a lot of what I am doing comes from <a href=\"http://www.bismarck-class.dk/shipmodels/german_models/uviicbaz.html\" target=\"_blank\">this kit built by Guillermo Martinez Baz</a>..  Nice looking model Guillermo..\n\nThe shape of the tower has a lot of gentle curves and odd shapes so I have had to play with and learn the falloff tools a lot better in modo.. It was a great learning experience but I didn't get a lot of work done for the 5 hours I spent on it..\n\nAlso the more I study Guillermo's real world plastic model, the more I think my model is way off in some places..  My decking at the top of the model for example isn't correct by a long shot.  Probably want I'm going to do is actually build an inner cigar shaped tube where the people would be to get some idea of why the exterior is shaped the way it is..\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2010/01/type-vii-05.jpg\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"type-vii-05\" src=\"/images/2010/01/type-vii-05-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>First Actual Render</span></a>\n\n__+2 hours - The first actual render__ - So here you have the very first render of my entirely incomplete Type VII-C German U-Boat.  My goal is to have it render out with that underwater look but for now I'm going to make it really bright so I can see all the defects..\n\nI still have a very long way to go.. I'm still working on the conning tower area as that will have a lot of detail.  I need to merge the two layers too so that the conning tower actually connects to the sub body, as right now they don't.  Still having fun!  That's what counts..\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2010/01/type-vii-06.jpg\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img src=\"/images/2010/01/type-vii-06-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Details and Lighting</span></a>\n\n__+4 hours - Adding detail and lighting__ - So there isn't much of a change to the model here other than for details that are hard to see, and the obvious lighting differences.  I'm going to be making the necessary detail changes to the model to make it look better and better slowly over time, but I'm also going to be working on texturing and lighting while I can.\n\nI have also learned that its not necessary to make everything part of the main mesh.. It's okay to have sub-d elements in different layers so long as it looks okay.  The idea being if in the real world something is made of a single piece of metal then sure one layer is appropriate, otherwise more than one is fine..\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2010/01/type-vii-07.jpg\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img src=\"/images/2010/01/type-vii-07-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Tail Features</span></a>\n\n__+7 hours - Tail Features__ - I have spent a good portion of the day working on the tail features of my sub as well as generally mucking around with the over all look of the boat.   But primarily, the rear dive plains, propeller shafts, rudders, supports, struts..etc..  I have a long way to go but this put a nice dent into the rear features that up to this point were completely missing.\n\nDuring this process it occurred to me that I don't know which way the props should be twisted.. And I kind of assumed that they counter rotate.. So if that is way off some one please tell me..  The rudders are actually to scale according to the plans I have but damn they look big.. And my plans arent accurate at all with how far apart the propellers are, and so I did my best to \"Guesstimate\" and I think I blew it..  They seem a little too close together..\n\nThe more I work on this thing the more I hate how some of it has come out.. I spent such a long time getting those side bulges working and now I think they are too prominent..  The top decking is all wrong too in a few places..   Still I know I should give myself a break.. I mean this wont be a perfect thing no matter how hard I try.. I just don't have the skills yet..  But I am going to work at it..  But my dreams of making this thing photo realistic likely wont happen at all..\n\nAnd I haven't even started to ruin the textures..\n\n__+10 hours - Still going!__ - Okay so I don't have a picture this update..  I'm in the process of correcting a horrible mistake I made..   At some point I subdivided the entire main hull and it caused a lot of odd rendering artifacts.. I was pretty upset that I had done this at first because apparently I did it days ago and didn't even notice!  Luckily I make daily backups of my model and I work in a lot of layers.. so thankfully its only a matter of using the old hull and bringing it back up to date, preferably without making the same mistake..\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2010/01/type-vii-10.jpg\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"type-vii-10\" src=\"/images/2010/01/type-vii-10-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Yay for rails</span></a>\n\n__+5 hours - Yay for rails__ - I'm guessing todays installment was roughly five hours worth of work..  Hard to say really in that it wasn't a straight piece of work..  It's really a continuation of work I did last night, and what little work I did today in between bug fixing for work which has been going on at a rabid pace..  Every hour or two I spend 20 minutes or so on the model... The bug fixing is killing me so this makes a nice change of pace..\n\nIn this update you'll see I'm starting to add lots and lots of railing everywhere... Ah good times..  I have also completely fixed the ugly striation crap that managed to work its way into the model because I was a dolt and did something stupid..\n\nPart of this fix was also to correct some big errors with the conning tower.. I still have a lot of work to do.. but its coming along nicely..\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2010/01/steelrope02.jpg\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"steelrope02\" src=\"/images/2010/01/steelrope02-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Steel Rope</span></a>\n\n__+5 hours - Steel Rope__ - I just got done spending the better part of the entire 5 hours learning to make rope.  3D rope that is..  The sub has quite a lot of steel rope hanging from various points on the hull and I wanted to get that to look right.\n\nAt first I just created a really long cylinder and sliced it up with the intent of just adding a 3D texture or displacement to make it look like strands of steel rope.. but it just looked crappy.. So, I had to actually create stranded rope..  This took me a long time and I had to get pretty intimate with Modo's Twist tool and the Soft Move tool..\n\nI still think the way I ultimately did it, was the wrong way..  I should have used a path and cloned <a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2010/01/steelrope01.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">a single rope</a> piece along that path, but it didn't work..  No matter what I tried, I just couldn't get the curve clone tool to output something that looked reasonable..  Plus it was REALLY laggy bringing modo to a stop trying to clone a &lt;1000 polygon item 100 times..  100,000 polygons isn't that heavy so I have no idea why it was struggling so hard with it.. I also tried to use a custom python script suggested to me on the modo forums called CurveDeformer, but it failed too.. (in odd ways) .. SO I was left to my own devices..\n\nIt took me too long to do this though.. I mean seriously ~5 hours to figure out this ONE thing.. sheesh..\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2010/01/type-vii-12.jpg\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"type-vii-12\" src=\"/images/2010/01/type-vii-12-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Steel Rope Details</span></a>\n\n__+3 hours - Steel Rope Detail__ - So I spent the majority of this time getting the steel rope finished on the back side of the boat.  It now hangs correctly between the two rail uprights on the back of the boat in such a way as to imply weight..  In the tail of the boat it rides over the risers in a ring then down into a hull point where its anchored.  And its simply wrapped around the lower conning tower platform rail and clamped together using a pair of wire clamps.  This isn't how it was actually done, but I thought having the wire simply wrapped around the rail and secured with a couple wire clamps made it look more real..   Very excited as to how it turned out.. I think it looks fantastic..\n\nThis model is starting to get rather beefy.. It's already a 5 meg file and renders out at over 3 million polygons, 15 million with subsampling turned on.  I call that starting to get heavy..  I know that a lot of the models the big boys work with are vast by comparison, but then so is the hardware they use..\n\nGonna keep working on this thing.. I haven't been playing any games at all since I started this project, its kept me that entertained.. Tomorrow I'm going to continue poking the detail holes in the side of the boat.. Good times.\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2010/01/type-vii-13.jpg\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"type-vii-13\" src=\"/images/2010/01/type-vii-13-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Poking holes</span></a>\n\n__+8 hours - Poking holes in the model__ -  For todays installment of \"make a sub\" I have been concentrating on poking holes in the side of the main hull mesh.  It's actually exceedingly difficult because of the non-linear off axis subd modeling method I'm using, combined with round holes..   I have to say so far so good!   I have a lot more holes to poke, and I need to add inner piping and details that could be visible from the outside..  This means I need to build a very basic model of what the internal cigar tube will look like and the basic support structures..  I have no clue what those actually should look like so I might just make it up..\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2010/01/type-vii-14.jpg\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"type-vii-14\" src=\"/images/2010/01/type-vii-14-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Waist Steel Cable</span></a>\n\nI also spent a chunk of my time adding the waist steel cables to the waist railings..   I went to a lot of trouble too wrapping the cable around the railings in a believable way..  I think it turned out pretty damn good if I do say so myself.. Though looking at it now in some areas I should have added a tad more twist to the cable, but since each cable is actually a strand of six cylinders its a pain in the rump to go back and change it now..  I'm really glad I went this route though as opposed to the one cylinder that gets textured into wire..  The actual twisted polygons while heavy in terms of polycount, really adds a lot in terms of details..\n\nI have to say I'm still have a great deal of fun making this model.. that bodes very well..  Typically when I do these things, they last for a couple of weeks before I want to move on to something else, but this model is really inspiring me to keep going..  It's been really cool seeing how each piece comes together to add up to more and more detail..   Every so often I scroll up to the top of this post and look at where it started and then look at where I am..  I realize I have a long way to go, but I have come a LONG way..\n\nI want to find some more pictures of real Type VII's up close so I can get a good idea of what the hull plating should actually look like.   I dunno if I should model that or just texture it..   I'll likely model the rivets, but texture the plates.. we shall see..\n\nAt this point this model is easily the most complex and well done model I have done to date..  Not only that but its by far the largest in terms of polygon count, file size.. render time..etc..\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2010/01/type-vii-15.jpg\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"type-vii-15\" src=\"/images/2010/01/type-vii-15-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Conning Tower Details</span></a>\n\n__+10 hours - Conning Tower Details__ - So after a day or two break I am back at it and have added a lot of detail to the conning tower.  I have a lot more I want to do and shall continue to work on it..  For this installment I have added several rails around the front of the tower for hand holds, as well as adding several doors and panels with hinges and handles..   I'm likely adding way too much in the way of details in that no one will ever see some of it.. I mean whats the likelihood someone will<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2010/01/type-vii-15a.jpg\"> zoom all the way in to a single hinge on one of those doors</a>..  heh but hey what the hell..\n\nIt's a learning process as much as it is anything else..  I mean I want this thing to look good and having a high-poly model that renders out well is the beginnings of that..\n\nThe real issue at this point is that the model is getting big enough that rendering it is starting to run me out of memory..  Any form of adaptive subdivision is right out of the question..   Plus I can only do one or two renders before I have to reload the model fresh.. memory leak I guess..  It's only mildly annoying..\n","collection":"posts","url":"/german-type-vii-submarine/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2010-02-21-i-hate-apple-fanboys.md","collection":"posts","url":"/i-hate-apple-fanboys/","path":"_posts/2010-02-21-i-hate-apple-fanboys.md","id":"/i-hate-apple-fanboys","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"I hate Apple fanboys","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2010/02/apple_fanboy.jpg","ribbon":null,"tile_size":"2x2","private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2010-02-21 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"i-hate-apple-fanboys","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2010-01-23-german-type-vii-submarine.md","excerpt":"So I have always liked submarines, I think they are pretty neat.  I have wanted to create a 3D sub for a while and finally decided to get started on one..","id":"/german-type-vii-submarine","draft":false,"categories":["Hobbies"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"German Type VII Submarine","layout":"post","tags":["3D Model"],"image":"/images/2010/01/type-vii-15.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2010-01-23 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"german-type-vii-submarine","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2010-02-21-i-hate-apple-fanboys.md","content":"<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2010/02/apple_fanboy.jpg\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"apple_fanboy\" src=\"/images/2010/02/apple_fanboy-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Apple Fanboy</span></a>\n\nI understand brand loyalty, but Apple fanatics take it to extremes..  Buying something just because it has an Apple logo on the side is ludicrous..  Recently I had (via a forum) a conversation with someone who was in the market for a new monitor and they had their heart set on either the 24\" or 30\" Apple Cinema Display..   I pointed out the <a href=\"/28-hdmi-monitor/\">28\" monitor that I use</a> and offered it as a possible alternative simply because the ACD's are stupidly expensive..\n\nI told him that my monitor was much less than the 30\" ACD he was leaning towards, and in fact you could likely get 6 of mine for one of those.. Plus I pointed out that the majority of the stats for my monitor was actually better than the ACD.  To which he said that the monitor I used was cheap and ugly.   And compared the Apple Cinema Display to a fine bottle of wine, where as my monitor was a cheap sixpack.\n\nWhat a pretentious douche..  He completely discounts my suggestion not on merit.. not on facts like specs or technical reasons.. No.. but because the Apple product is a fine bottle of wine, where as mine is a single out of a cheap six pack..  Wow..  The level of snobbery amazes me..  Hey buddy, you're douchebag is showing..\n\nFine.. its his money, if he wants to blow almost two thousand dollars on something that he could get for three hundred.. go for it..  My mistake for trying to be helpful..  I gotta say though blind loyalty like that is retarded..  Buying something just because its the most expensive doesn't guarantee its the best.. And buying something just so you can say you have one is equally dumb..  Fools and their money..  Most likely all you're buying is that Apple logo..\n\nHaving said all this, I love my Mac Mini and the Apple products I use.. I have several.. I just would never purchase one of their monitors due to them being outlandishly expensive..  And for me the biggest thing that keeps me from buying more Apple products are the fanboys like this who are so snobby and stuck up it's painful to deal with them.  And to think I actually tried to help this \"genius\"..\n\nApple needs to reinvent their image cause frankly that shit puts people off..\n","collection":"posts","url":"/i-hate-apple-fanboys/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2010-02-21-i-hate-apple-fanboys.md","collection":"posts","url":"/i-hate-apple-fanboys/","path":"_posts/2010-02-21-i-hate-apple-fanboys.md","id":"/i-hate-apple-fanboys","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"I hate Apple fanboys","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2010/02/apple_fanboy.jpg","ribbon":null,"tile_size":"2x2","private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2010-02-21 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"i-hate-apple-fanboys","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2010-02-27-im-about-to-say-fuck-starcraft-2.md","content":"So I have been playing in the Starcraft 2 beta and to be honest, I'm not overly impressed.  It's basically the same game brought forward with some refinement..  Fine..

I don't want to have to suffer the fanboy jackasses who feel the need to tell you how much you suck every five minutes just to make themselves feel better..   I mean seriously how pathetic are you that you have to continually tell others they suck to make yourself feel better..\n\nMy second point is the balance issue..  I'm sorry but I always felt Starcraft 1 was out of balance..   Well guess what.. Starcraft 2 is also unbalanced..  And you'd think that Blizzard might take it as a clue that if everyone is playing one race, and no one is playing another race.. there's a reason for it.\n\nI just got finished playing a 2v2 game in which the opponents partner quit about 10 seconds into the game..  So it was actually a 2v1 game with 2 Zerg players versus 1 Terran player.\n\nI always play Zerg, and this was the VERY FIRST TIME I had seen another player intentionally play Zerg..  In all the other games I have played so far, everyone plays Terran..  Clue one that Terran are over powered is that everyone plays them.. I have seen a few folks play protoss but not many..\n\nAnd We played for something like 45 minutes, two Zerg versus one Terran and couldn't beat him.  2v1 and we lost.    We used up ALL the resources on the map and weren't able to get him out of his bolt hole..   Yes.. ALL of the resources.. I had 6 bases by the end of the game and my partner had 4..  The opponent just proceeded to nuke us into oblivion and all the attacking we did in the world did no good what so ever..\n\nHe had SWARMS of stuff flying and running around, was poking us from all sides as well as a continual nuke spam, and was mounting an impossible defense of our combined and organized attacks..  And he only ever had 2 bases.. He also had ample time to tell us how much we sucked..\n\nI know I'm not great at this game.. but I'm not that darn bad.. and my partner seemed to know what he was doing..  I think it's a pretty clear case of one side being over powered..\n\nI tried to ask the Terran player what he was doing and he proceeded to tell me how great he was and how my parents should be embarrassed they gave birth to me...   This is a friend or a family member of a Blizzard employee..   Fine..

Someone who is willing to pirate software isn't willing to pay for it.. EVER!  So you never had their money in the first place..\n\nYou're trying so hard to capture that imagined lost revenue that it's blinding you to how badly you're screwing yourselves and your real customers..\n\nEquating the number of pirated copies of your software directly to dollars is retarded.. More over, implementing these harsh DRM models only serves to prevent the honest players from playing your games, which effectively assures that you're going to lose real money in the form of people who actually DO buy your games going else where..\n\nLet take the new Silent Hunter 5 game as an example..   SH5 (a game with a lot of bugs and other issues that already pisses paying customers off) comes with the new DRM which forces you to be connected to the internet 100% of the time.   The new system which the Ubisoft exec's spin as being a positive thing for the customer is constantly phoning home to make sure you're still allowed to play the game.. The game you purchased.\n\nIf at any time during your play period the connection to the mother ship fails, you stop playing the game.  You can't save your game.. You can't do anything..  Effectively the game you purchased goes into cripple ware mode..  This is bullshit.\n\nThe hacker community took one good look at that and said \"F'to you Ubi\" and hacked it within the first 24 hours of release..  These people had no intention of buying the game in the first place so who does it actually hurt?\n\nME!  If I'm playing the game that I purchased and I go on a road trip with my laptop, I can't play it..  The hacker can.. he can play just fine..\n\nIf I am playing the game that I purchased at home and for whatever reason my internet goes out (it happens), I'm screwed..   Not the hacker.. He can keep playing..\n\nSo.. whats my recourse?  Nothing.. I'm just shit out of luck.. I have to either accept their crappy DRM because apparently they think I'm the problem, or not buy the game in the first place..  The hacker doesn't care, he isn't troubled by these problems at all and in no way has the DRM affected him at all..\n\nDRM only punishes the paying customer!  Ubisoft is trying like hell to spin their new DRM in a positive light, but it's not..  they claim that it's \"A platform of online services for PC titles offering gamers a more in-depth gaming experience as well as providing an innovative solution for reducing PC game piracy.\"   HUH?!\n\nHow did you do either of those things?   It does absolutely NOTHING to offer me a more in-depth gaming experience and in fact does the opposite in that suddenly I have this invasive piece of software on my system that prevents me from playing at all from time to time..  I paid for the game, yet I'm punished.\n\nAnd it doesn't prevent or even reduce software piracy considering it was hacked out in the first 24 hours.  The hackers never even notice the games DRM, it doesn't bother them in the slightest..\n\nAt this point you're actually encouraging people like me to hack the game because your own DRM is preventing the honest player from playing the game he paid for..  That's right.. your DRM which is there to prevent piracy is actually encouraging piracy because otherwise we can't play the game..  Good job genius..\n\nYou're so busy counting the imaginary lost dollars you're missing the fact that your real dollars are heading out the door.. The proof is in the pudding.. Your current sales for this year are down by over 20% and I have to think you only have yourselves to blame..\n\nI realize fully that the \"higher ups\" are the ones making these decisions, but someone MUST stand up and tell them why DRM is not the right solution..  If you guys don't stop the DRM shenanigans you guys are going to hemorrhage not money, but customers..\n","collection":"posts","url":"/ubisoft-and-their-drm/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2010-03-08-ubisoft-and-their-drm.md","collection":"posts","url":"/ubisoft-and-their-drm/","path":"_posts/2010-03-08-ubisoft-and-their-drm.md","id":"/ubisoft-and-their-drm","draft":false,"categories":["Games","Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Ubisoft and their DRM","layout":"post","tags":["Ubisoft","DRM"],"image":"/images/2010/03/drm.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2010-03-08 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"ubisoft-and-their-drm","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2010-03-15-8mm-mauser-reloading.md","content":"<img title=\"Reloading Press\" src=\"/images/2010/03/reloadpress-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" class='pull-right' />\n\nI really enjoy shooting..  I always have..  In the military I would go to the range every weekend and throw some rounds down range just for the pure joy of it..  And while I would sometimes shoot my pistols, I prefer rifles..  I dunno what it is, but there is something very peaceful about the focus and presence of mind you need to effectively shoot a rifle..\n\nI liked it because when shooting, all the cares of the day seemed to kinda slip away..  You had to focus on what you're doing and not be distracted by anything in order to hit your target, especially at range..  I have missed it..\n\nThe main reason I have missed it was due to cost, and distance..  Simply put there aren't any ranges near where I live, and since my primary round is 7.92x57mm Mauser it can get a tad pricey..  Enter reloading..\n\nI have wanted to get back into shooting something fearce and have been trolling several shooter forums trying to find a new inexpensive round that I can shoot that would afford me the accuracy I require in a cost effective manner..   A lot of people have suggested .223, .308 or even 6br.. But that would require a whole new rifle, not exactly a cheap solution..\n\nSo instead, I have started to reload my old used 8mm brass..  It's so easy too!!  I have to admit I'm shocked at the simplicity of the process.. Plus the saves are about 50% a round..\n\nPreviously the el'cheapo stock ammo purchased off the intertubes went for about $1 a round or as much as $2.50 a round at the range -- reloading my old brass comes in at $0.53 a round.. Yay!!    And the nice thing is I don't have to buy a new rifle..\n\nHaving said that I would love to get a new rifle..hehe  For now I'm going to just keep reloading the 8mm stuff and shoot the guns I have, but I still like the idea of getting something else.. Plus I spent a good deal of time pouring over the <a href=\"http://savagearms.com\" target=\"_blank\">Savage Arms</a> website, and I must admit some of those guns made me drool a little..\n\nBut they are a tad pricey..  Plus I'm back to facing the chambering issue.. what should I get?  I'm sort of leaning towards a bench rest gun since the range I go to doesn't allow for freestanding or prone shooting.. (They say its for insurance reasons..)\n\nMy friends suggest .223 and .308 because they are common rounds.. Of the two I'd be more likely to go .308 over .223 because its a traditional round that can be used for anything where as the .223 is more of a varmant round..  But the 6br (.243 basically) has a lot going for it too.. I dunno..\n\nRight now it's a moot point because of cost..  A good rifle to fire any of those rounds would cost $1500 new.. And that's only half the cost.. without good optics you might as well be throwing rocks..   It's insane how much a good scope can run you..\n\nOh well.. I'll keep reloading my mauser and dream..\n","collection":"posts","url":"/8mm-mauser-reloading/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2010-04-05-cant-talk-playing-rock-band.md","collection":"posts","url":"/cant-talk-playing-rock-band/","path":"_posts/2010-04-05-cant-talk-playing-rock-band.md","id":"/cant-talk-playing-rock-band","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Can't talk... playing Rock Band!","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2010/04/rock_band_2_callout-150x150.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2010-04-05 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"cant-talk-playing-rock-band","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2010-03-15-8mm-mauser-reloading.md","excerpt":"I really enjoy shooting..  I always have..  In the military I would go to the range every weekend and throw some rounds down range just for the pure joy of it..  And while I would sometimes shoot my pistols, I prefer rifles.. ","id":"/8mm-mauser-reloading","draft":false,"categories":["Hobbies"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"8mm Mauser Reloading","layout":"post","tags":["Shooting","Reloading"],"image":"/images/2010/03/reloadpress-150x150.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2010-03-15 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"8mm-mauser-reloading","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2010-03-08-ubisoft-and-their-drm.md","excerpt":"When will companies learn that their draconian efforts to prevent piracy only serves to hurt their paying customers which directly affects their bottom line!!","id":"/ubisoft-and-their-drm","draft":false,"categories":["Games","Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Ubisoft and their DRM","layout":"post","tags":["Ubisoft","DRM"],"image":"/images/2010/03/drm.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2010-03-08 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"ubisoft-and-their-drm","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2010-02-27-im-about-to-say-fuck-starcraft-2.md","excerpt":"So I have been playing in the Starcraft 2 beta and to be honest, I'm not overly impressed.  It's basically the same game brought forward with some refinement..  Fine..
