I played CoH for almost a year starting back in Feb. 2005 when it first came out.  I like to refer to it as MMO Lite.\n\nIt's a good game, and a good starter game for those who aren't really sure about the whole MMO scene.  It's very simple to play and enjoy, and doesn't bog you down with many of the more complex MMO aspects.  For new comers to the market, its perfect.   It's how I got my wife into MMO's and now I can't get her away from the computer.. heh  (\"I just have this one last quest to do..\"  \"Uh huh.. sure honey.. \"  heh)\n\nAfter a while I moved on to other games, but found myself reactivating my account from time to time to give it a try.  For a while I played my City of Villains character almost exclusively until it once again just tired and I moved on.\n\nWell I'm back at it.  They have added a lot of content and depth to the game that really is interesting.  Firstly its not like your more modern / typical MMO in that there aren't characters standing around with question marks over their head letting you know there is something to do.  Lets be honest here, World of Warcraft is a good game but its seriously \"dumbed down\" in that it almost holds your hand while it plays itself.\n\nCity of Heroes hearkens back to the days of EverQuest 1 whereby you didn't know if someone had a quest or something for you unless you talked to them.  Accomplishments were hidden from you, and thereby meant more to you when you actually accomplished it.\n\nDeath in CoH means something too compared to modern day MMO's.  CoH has debt!   Now I played Ultima Online and EverQuest 1 for years, so extremely painful death was the norm for me.  In UO each time some naked PK ran up and killed you, you lost EVERYTHING!  It sucked.  In EQ1 though they changed that a lot in that you just had to make a corpse run and lost exp.  But you didn't lose your stuff..   When CoH came out and they made it so you just got a little bit of debt, I was stunned.  They made death meaningless.\n\nHA!  Look at what modern games do.  In the most recent MMO, Age of Conan, death means absolutely nothing. You just get shot back to a respawn point.\n\nBut I get side tracked -- the CoH is a good game and I'm finding I really enjoy the new Rikti invasion stuff and I hope they will let us \"counter invade\" at some point.  It'd be really cool to go to the Rikit homeworld or whatever and attack them back!! (maybe you can do this already and I just havent gotten to that content.. I dunno)\n\nSomething else they have added to the game is a pretty thorough marketplace and crafting system.  I like that -- thats pretty darn cool.  Well, one of the tricks of old is to watch your prices on that market.  I mean I dont understand why players, in game after game, will put stuff on the market below what they could sell them to the merchant for!!\n\nI spent about 4 hours last night just running goods from the market to the local merchant to sell.  People would put stuff on the market for 10INF, that they could sell to the merchants for 4500+INF.   Seriously.\n\nIn 4 hours I made 2 million INF which just goes to show you, super heroes is st00pid.  Or lazy.  I prefer to think of them as stupid.\n","previous":{"next":{"path":"_posts/2008-06-17-super-heroes-is-st00pid.md","url":"/super-heroes-is-st00pid/","relative_path":"_posts/2008-06-17-super-heroes-is-st00pid.md","id":"/super-heroes-is-st00pid","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Super Heroes is st00pid","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2008/06/cohgamebox.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-06-17 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"super-heroes-is-st00pid","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2008-06-15-age-of-conan-annoys-me.md","output":null,"content":"<img class=\"pull-right\" title=\"Age of Conan\" src=\"/images/2008/06/age_of_conan_cover-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" />\n\nI'm starting to get upset / annoyed with Age of Conan.  Probably it's more fair to say, disappointed -- but you can only scream at your monitor for so long before disappointment spirals down into something else. \n\nMy main character is a ranger -- and as with all games that have a ranger class, he's broken.  Primarily when it comes to damage output. \n\nI understand that a ranger, being a subset of the rogue class, can't tank.  I'm there.  In EQ1 rangers were made of paper.. I'm cool with that.. But the ranger should be able to put out some damage, and since they can't tank, they should be able to put out damage at range.  If they can't for any reason do ranged damage, what's the point of a ranger?   \n\nIn AoC the ranger can melee, use a bow, or use a crossbow.   Melee with an AoC ranger is a joke -- don't waste your time.  Crossbow has some nice damage, but its slow damage -- and the majority of the skills are for bow not crossbow.  You're really best using a bow.\n\nOkay fine. I'll use a bow -- which is what I wanted in the first place.  The issue is with the various attack abilities with a bow, most of them are broken.\n\n__Salvo__\nThe number one issue, and the number one skill used by a bow ranger is \"Salvo\".  Salvo pisses me off to no end.\n\nSalvo is a 3 key combo  -- Meaning you poke the \"Salvo\" hot key, then you have to do two directional attacks in order to get the full combo (and thus the full damage) to fire off.  The problem is that salvo, as the name implies, fires more shots than you press keys for.\n\nThe first salvo hot key fires one shot usually straight initiating the combo.  The second key fires one shot either left or lower left, to try to get them to refocus their shields. And the third key fires 3 shots straight -- but it does 3 individual attacks, its not like you knock up 3 arrows and fire them all at once.\n\nIt's this third key that is the problem in that if anything interrupts your third key and those 3 attacks, the mob gets all the health back that he lost due to the combo.   This could be over a thousand points of health he just suddenly gets back.. *pop*  Insta-heal.\n\nFurther more, if you kill him on the first shot of the salvo, he still does damage to you until the entire combo finishes.  It takes about 8 seconds for the entire combo to resolve itself and I have died many times during that 8 seconds to a mob that was DEAD but still swinging.. \n\nAnd of course if they kill you this way, they are suddenly full health and back standing there!!\n\nIf the mob dodges or you \"miss\" with the first shot of the salvo, ALL shots of the salvo miss. Time well spent.\n\nSalvo needs to be fixed.. But so far they wont even acknowledge that it's a bug.\n\n__Some shots don't register at all__\nSometimes you will go through the combo keys and nothing happens on the final key.  No \"Miss\" text, no \"Mob is too far away\" text, nothing.. just.. nothing.  You're left standing there wondering why the hell the mob didn't just take damage.  Time well spent.  \n\n__No Range__\nThe ranger also has ZERO RANGE!  It kills me how short ranged the bow is.. A bow in AoC has about a 50 foot range.  (Hard to say how many \"feet\" it actually is, but it aint far.)  I'm not saying the bow should have a 300 yard range, but it should have a longer range than it does.  It's down right silly how short it is, and makes a rangers life suck as you basically have to get into melee range to shoot.\n\nGive us some room to shoot folks!\n\n__Different Range First Person to Third Person__\nWhat?!  I want to know who the smacktard was that thought it was a good idea to give the bow and crossbow a different range based on first person or third person shooting.  What bone head thought this was a good idea?\n\nWhy does my bow have a range half again as long when in first person?  Why does my bow's combo's have a very short range, yet I can key up an arrow to fire at any range? etc..  This is just stupid.. \n\n__Shooting from a ledge__\nOne of the missions early on tells you that you need to go stop the mobs from shooting their bows from a ledge high up, because it's killing the good guys.  SO you rush up there, kill them, only to realize that .. hey, this is a good spot to snipe back at the bad guys too!\n\nSo, you target up a mob and let fly.. Only to see them constantly evade..  You have line of sight, you have range.. you are above them though and they \"can't get to you\" so instead of letting you murder them fair and square, they just evade,evade,evade like a broken mob.  \n\nThis is fucked up.. The whole point of the mission was to stop them from doing this, only to find out that YOU can't do this.   WHY?!  If I can get up on this ledge, so can they -- as proven by the fact that THEY WERE UP HERE FIRST!  This is just down right stupid and breaks the game to me.  You say you want players to be clever and try new things, then break the new things we try.  What bullshit.   If mobs are getting shot from someone they can't get to, RUN OUT OF RANGE.  It's short enough... \n\nI can go on, but you get the point by now..  This game is very beautiful.. More over, the 1 to 20 game is awe inspiring, and should be a lesson to other games as to how a game should be made.  \n\nAt 21 though (or when you get off the island) the polish comes crashing down.  It's sad really.  I know for a fact it's driving players away.  Several of my friends have already left due to these annoying bugs.. Above are just the ones that the ranger suffers.. each class has their own set just like this.. \n\nI do like the new combat system, but it isn't enough to support a game.  You need to get the rest of this crap working.. \n\nIn six or eight months this game will likely be awesome.. but for now it's annoying and upsets me.  Time will tell, but I dunno if I will stick it out.\n\n \n\n \n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2008-06-14-assassins-creed.md","url":"/assassins-creed/","relative_path":"_posts/2008-06-14-assassins-creed.md","id":"/assassins-creed","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Assassins Creed","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2008/06/256px-assassins_creed.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-06-14 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"assassins-creed","ext":".md"},"url":"/age-of-conan-annoys-me/","relative_path":"_posts/2008-06-15-age-of-conan-annoys-me.md","id":"/age-of-conan-annoys-me","collection":"posts","excerpt":"I'm starting to get upset / annoyed with Age of Conan.  Probably it's more fair to say, disappointed -- but you can only scream at your monitor for so long before disappointment spirals down into something else. ","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Age of Conan is beginning to annoy me","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2008/06/age_of_conan_cover.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-06-15 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"age-of-conan-annoys-me","ext":".md"},"url":"/super-heroes-is-st00pid/","relative_path":"_posts/2008-06-17-super-heroes-is-st00pid.md","id":"/super-heroes-is-st00pid","collection":"posts","excerpt":"City of Heroes (and thus City of Villains) is one of those sleeper games that has a lot of hidden depth.

Above are just the ones that the ranger suffers.. each class has their own set just like this.. \n\nI do like the new combat system, but it isn't enough to support a game.  You need to get the rest of this crap working.. \n\nIn six or eight months this game will likely be awesome.. but for now it's annoying and upsets me.  Time will tell, but I dunno if I will stick it out.\n\n \n\n \n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2008-06-14-assassins-creed.md","url":"/assassins-creed/","relative_path":"_posts/2008-06-14-assassins-creed.md","id":"/assassins-creed","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Assassins Creed","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2008/06/256px-assassins_creed.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-06-14 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"assassins-creed","ext":".md"},"url":"/age-of-conan-annoys-me/","relative_path":"_posts/2008-06-15-age-of-conan-annoys-me.md","id":"/age-of-conan-annoys-me","collection":"posts","excerpt":"I'm starting to get upset / annoyed with Age of Conan.  Probably it's more fair to say, disappointed -- but you can only scream at your monitor for so long before disappointment spirals down into something else. ","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Age of Conan is beginning to annoy me","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2008/06/age_of_conan_cover.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-06-15 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"age-of-conan-annoys-me","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2008-06-14-assassins-creed.md","output":null,"content":"<img class=\"pull-right\" title=\"Assassins Creed\" src=\"/images/2008/06/256px-assassins_creed-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\nAnother console to PC port that's been out since April, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassins_creed\" target=\"_blank\">Assassins Creed</a> is a third person sneaker created by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubisoft\" target=\"_blank\">Ubisoft</a> in which the player repeatedly delves into his genetic memory in order to assume the role of a 12th century assassin trying to kill various historical figures during the crusades in the holy land.\n\nSimply put, this is a very impressive game -- Not perfect, but worth the purchase.  To be honest I'm not sure why I waited as long as I did.  The game itself is quite beautiful and has a very nice story line.  It's the first game in a while that I would classify as \"smart\" and clever at every stage -- taking quite a step away from your usual brute force or shoot'em up games.  Stealth in this game is everything.\n\nThe player must use all manner of stealthy game mechanics like eavesdropping,  pickpocketing, and assassination in order to complete the missions.  Running in swinging your sword to just kill everything simply wont work, and while you're not nurfed like you were in Thief, you still can't take the overwhelming odds that you'll encounter if you try to hack your way through.\n\nThe game mechanics are excellent as anything you walk at, run at or into, jump at/on/over will cause your character to behave exactly as you'd expect him to.  The \"oh wow\" moment for me was early on when I jumped and landed on a short platform and went a little too far.  The character hit the edge and flailed trying to regain his balance.  It looked very convincing.  The climbing mechanic is extremely well done, and you'll use it pretty much constantly.\n\nYour character is extremely athletic, probably unreasonably so heh.  I wish I could hang by my finger tips for an hour while my player went to the store for a coke..  And while jumping off the tower into the cart looks keen and all,  that'd kill the hell out of you!\n\nI did find some issues with the game;\n\nJumping into water .. KILLS YOU!  heh, harsh.  But then I guess this is a desert memory and he can't swim.\n\nI'm not sure how slowing down and ducking your head makes you less conspicuous.. but.. it does.  This really is the only mechanic I don't understand, but then how else would you provide a button that allows you to \"fly casual\".\n\nControls are extremely unintuitive and border on confusing.  Especially for a PC gamer who doesn't play console games.  You can really tell that this is a console game that was ported to PC where the controls are concerned.. The main issue is there is a LOT of things you can do and they try to do all of them with some combination of 4 buttons.\n\nWhile the controls for the game are unintuitive and confusing, they give you quite a lot of options both in and out of combat.  And I don't care who you are, sneaking up to an archer on the top of a building and pushing him off to watch him fall to his death is good wholesome fun.  You will eventually realize that you can be extremely \"loose\" with controlling your character and he'll usually behave the way you wanted.\n\nThis is something that most PC players will have a hard time with simply because they are used to micro-managing their characters, as opposed to console games which will partly play themselves.\n\nThe graphics engine seems a tad unoptimized as I get a solid 60fps (with vsync) but there is video lag and jumpiness.. Also the game is beautiful, yet it has no ingame option for anti-aliasing.  This is a common trend of game makers lately and it boggles the mind.  Games with AA look so much better than without, but most of them don't use AA.  It saddens me.  Forcing AA through the control panel has odd and unplayable results.\n\nThat's really it.    Most of my complaints are pretty minor.  The game is a lot of fun and most likely will be one that I finish.  (For me that's a sign of a good game.)\n\nOh and Chad, my computer gets a solid 60fps in most places though in a couple of the way up high views were you see everything, it dips into the 50s.  =)   Max graphics baby!   *sniff* I love my computer..\n","previous":{"next":{"path":"_posts/2008-06-14-assassins-creed.md","url":"/assassins-creed/","relative_path":"_posts/2008-06-14-assassins-creed.md","id":"/assassins-creed","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Assassins Creed","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2008/06/256px-assassins_creed.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-06-14 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"assassins-creed","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2008-06-13-mass-effect.md","output":null,"content":"<img class=\"pull-right\" title=\"Mass Effect PC Box Cover\" src=\"/images/2008/06/256px-masseffect_box_cover-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Mass Effect PC Box COver\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" />Being the avid PC gamer that I am, I wasn't about to go and buy an XBox 360 back in Nov. '07 just for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect\">Mass Effect</a>.. but damn I came close..\n\nThis game looked awesome!  Everyone that played it said it was awesome and that I should rush out and get a console to play it -- so needless to say I was really annoyed that it wasn't a PC game and even more annoyed at folks telling me to buy a console.. But I was very excited when I heard it was eventually coming to the PC!\n\nWhen it hit the shelves for the PC back in May I pretty much went and got it as soon as I could.  (I was a couple days late, but a funeral will do that.. )\n\nWhat an absolutely fantastic game! I maintain that Bioware is an awesome company and that they do good work. I have liked just about all of their games; Baldur's gate was fun, BG2 of course was a good game, Neverwinter nights was well done, but had issues. And of course KotOR was fantastic.  So I knew when I heard that Mass Effect was being put out by these guys, it was going to be a rockin game.  Oh how right I was..\n\nThe game is so polished!  I mean from character creation all the way through the end of the game, it just feels right, and works.   Everything works!  It is the closest thing to \"playing a movie\" that I have ever experienced.\n\nWhat I love about it is that you can play the game differently multiple times through, choosing a different class, past, powers, weapons, armors, friends, missions, assignments, personality..etc.. and play the same game in a completely different way!\n\nAnd whats awesome is, the game will play right along.  The voice over actors will actually do different dialogs depending on your past history, your past actions, your current actions, and will correctly label you if you're male or female!  I really hope they got their money back on the sheer volume of voice acting they had to supply this sucker!\n\nI can't say enough good things about this game.. I want to salute Bioware!  And to think they are currently working on Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3!! *GLEE*  (though probably for the consoles first.. *grumble*)\n\nI read quite a few posts about the game too and the biggest complaint is that it was short.  Which boggles my mind.  The first play through took me 25+ hours, and I didn't do everything.  There was still quite a lot of content that I didn't do.. (I initiated the final end game mission without really realizing that was what I was doing.. but then.. I'm st00pid..)\n\n25+ hours of game play, especially for a game you can play again in so many different ways, seems very reasonable.   I mean other games of this nature didn't have that much content..  Plus they are talking about releasing future downloadable content?  Seriously..\n\nThis game very much rules..  In all likelihood you should get it...\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2008-06-12-3g-iphone.md","url":"/3g-iphone/","relative_path":"_posts/2008-06-12-3g-iphone.md","id":"/3g-iphone","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"3G iPhone","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2008/06/3giphone.png","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2008-06-12 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"3g-iphone","ext":".md"},"url":"/mass-effect/","relative_path":"_posts/2008-06-13-mass-effect.md","id":"/mass-effect","collection":"posts","excerpt":"This game looked awesome!
