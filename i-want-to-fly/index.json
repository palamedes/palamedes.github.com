But I have never owned a high quality camera.  This week I was given the opportunity by my company to purchase a high quality camera for some projects we are working on.  I was totally stoked!\n\nMy brother is a Nikon fan and he does really well with them, but I have always been partial to Canon.  I really have no good reason for that other than my past experiences with their equipment and costumer service.\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2013/06/meeko_flatdog.jpg\" class=\"pull-left fancybox\"><img title=\"He was getting tired.\" src=\"/images/2013/06/meeko_flatdog.jpg\" alt=\"He was getting tired.\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>He was getting tired.</span></a>\n\nI own a Canon G1 Powershot (the first one in the line) and it always served me well until it was simply eclipsed by time and technology.  I have a Canon XL1 movie camera which again, great piece of equipment but at this point is completely outdated.  And a Canon Powershot SD770IS \"elph\" which is a great little pocket point and shoot..  but I wanted a camera I can really put to the test and get the full experience.\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2013/06/meeko_catdog.jpg\" class=\"pull-right fancybox\"><img title=\"Catdog!\" src=\"/images/2013/06/meeko_catdog.jpg\" alt=\"Catdog!\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>He's our Cat-dog.</span></a>\n\nI opt'ed to get the Canon EOS 6D full frame and couldn't be happier.. What a monster!\n\nI plan to take a lot of photos to learn how to make this thing work and perform prior to our project which is still hush-hush.\n\nMeeko does make for some fun shooting through.  He likes to sleep on the back of the couch.  He's the most cat like dog I've ever seen.\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2013/06/duck.jpg\" class=\"pull-left fancybox\"><img title=\"Ducks!\" src=\"/images/2013/06/duck.jpg\" alt=\"Ducks!\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Okay it's official.</span></a>\n\nAlso according to one of the photography websites I troll, the first official photo with your camera is supposed to be of ducks.. No clue why.. but I went out and found some ducks and took photos.. I have a lot but I find they are kinda boring subjects..\n\n---\n\nAlso, I am not really happy with the look of the blog.  The more I look at it, the more I hate it - and I'm not done converting it from wordpress.. hah\n\nI think I will continue working on the conversion but at the same time I want to invest some time in making it look better.. Frankly, it's boring, ugly and trying to do too much.  The real issue I have is that right now \"Flat\" is in.  Apparently Microsoft did something right as everyone is emulating their flat design on Windows 8, including Apple with their OS7 update soon to hit.\n\nI have to admit I'm torn..\n\nPart of me thinks its ugly, but I can see the appeal and It could grow on me.  I'm pondering a redesign.  I'm thinking a combination of dynamicly loaded flat design and more traditional SAAS application design.  I'll keep you posted.\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2013-04-02-google-chrome-reload-options.md","url":"/google-chrome-reload-options/","relative_path":"_posts/2013-04-02-google-chrome-reload-options.md","id":"/google-chrome-reload-options","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Software Development"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Google chrome reload options","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2013/04/google-chrome-hard-refresh.png","gallery":null,"ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2013-04-02 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"google-chrome-reload-options","ext":".md"},"url":"/meeko-photography-and-look/","relative_path":"_posts/2013-06-30-meeko-photography-and-look.md","id":"/meeko-photography-and-look","collection":"posts","excerpt":"I have long wanted a really nice camera -- this week I got one!

It was a pretty tall undertaking to begin with and I was doing it in a language that I had just learned..  A bit of a lofty goal to be honest..  Doable, but the motivation wasn't really there..\n\nI didn't really feel any pressing issue as wordpress was working just fine -- but then I really thought about it and I realized that WP wasn't working just fine for me.. infact, I had pretty much stopped using it entirely due to its various issues and my particular feelings about it.  I was no longer updating my blog at all and that was starting to go against the grain..\n\nTo be frank, I was tired of the design and the lack of flexibility, it's bloat, it's poor performance and it's constant security issues..  I think WP is a fine solution if you have no technical chops and I think its place on the web has been thoroughly earned, but for me I just didn't want to have to fight with it any more.\n\nI wanted to write some stuff for it and I've been working exclusively in Ruby for the past year and a half, so I was not really interested in working on something written in PHP, a language that now officially considers me an apostate.\n\nI also noticed that every damn time I logged in there were new hacks or exploits injected into it that hadn't been there previously..  My server is hardened yet people still manage to find ways to exploit WP to put their crap in my blog..  So I was tired of it constantly getting exploited and having to fight that fight was very draining only disincentivized me even more.\n\nI examined what I was trying to do with my blog and started to shop around for ruby solutions;  Enter Jekyll.\n\nJekyll is \"a simple, blog aware, static site generator\" that's written entirely in Ruby that allows me to write my blog entries in simple markdown and export the whole thing using Git to deploy.\n\nI was putting a lot of time, effort and code into a blogging solution that was basically a replacement for wordpress, but it solved all the same problems in exactly the same way -- just in a different language..  That doesn't make sense and it was a bad idea from the start..\n\nAlso one of the directions I was going was to have it so that my dynamic blogging solution would output git pages statically..  Well, why do I need the dynamic blog at all then?!\n\nThe best part is, I can just host it on Github itself, or Amazone S3 for pennies.  And all the files are static, so there is no blog to hack.  There is no back end code to exploit.  Oh and if you do manage to break it or wipe it out, I just redeploy.  Done.\n\nReally it is the best solution out there for this and I'm very excited about using it.\n\n","previous":{"next":{"path":"_posts/2013-02-01-blogging-like-its-1999.md","url":"/blogging-like-its-1999/","relative_path":"_posts/2013-02-01-blogging-like-its-1999.md","id":"/blogging-like-its-1999","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Software Development"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Blogging like its 1999!","layout":"post","tags":["Ruby"],"image":"/images/2013/01/jekyll.png","gallery":null,"ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2013-02-01 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"blogging-like-its-1999","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2012-11-07-electoral-college-versus-popular-vote.md","output":null,"content":"So, with the 2012 presidential election finally over, I'd like to discuss some of the things that I saw during the whole shebang.\n\nI noticed at one point during the process Mitt Romney had more popular vote than Barack Obama but at the same time Barack Obama had more electoral votes  which made me wonder if the popular vote actually matters at all.\n\nI did a bunch of research that harkens back to my 20 plus years ago social study courses because I simply didn't remember the purpose of the electoral college with regards to the popular vote.\n\nThe electoral college was implemented in order to represent the population of a given state before people could travel to the election sites and actually cast ballots. Way back then it took several days if not longer to travel all those distances and so quite often votes weren't being made at all. The electoral college system changed all that and allowed people to have a voice even when they weren't able to directly cast a ballot. It's very much a winner take all system, so in one sense the general election popular vote does not matter when you consider the country as a whole.\n\nWhere it does matter is at a state level; As a rule of thumb, the electoral college will award the winner of your states popular vote all of the state's electoral votes. And, the winner of the most electoral votes wins the general election.\n\nThe use of the electoral college system is a debatable issue at this point in history it gives and takes. On the one hand, it makes dissenting votes in a non-swing state meaningless. For example, if your state is heavily Democratic, your vote for Republican party member (while it still technically counts) really has no impact on the election as a whole.\n\nOn the other hand, it prevents grossly overpopulated states from having total control of the election. Without the electoral college vote system in place and if the popular vote was all that counted, states like California, New York, Illinois and Georgia would have a huge influence on the election while entire states like Iowa or Alaska (which are very lightly populated by comparison) would not have any significance in the election at all.\n\nWhat I find interesting is, I believe the electoral college system actually encourages people to not vote. Under the electoral college system, if you know your state is primarily Democratic or primarily Republican and you tend to vote the same way then you don't actually have to vote because really your vote won't count towards the popular vote of any other state and if your state votes your way already why bother taking the trip in the first place.\n\nOn the other hand, if your state primarily votes one way and you vote the other, then the electoral college system can be seen as a form of oppression or even tyranny of the masses because no amount of voting will actually make any difference -- so again why bother?\n\nI think at one time the electoral college system was really a good thing, but I'm not sure it is any more. Maybe it's something of a bygone age that needs to be reconsidered in this modern time of fast cars, internet and ultra connectivity.
