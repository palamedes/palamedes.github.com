Ha ha!*\n\n__Day 984__ ::  The evil one has errected a huge conifer in the middle of the house and decorated it with all manner of taunting colorful bobbley bits! Clearly an attempt to annoy me further.  I shall destroy as much of it as possible.\n\n__DAY 972__ :: The collaborator is no more! The tall fat one knew that I was on to his attempt to introduce a spy into or ranks and has removed him. I shudder to think of the punishment for failure! He \"put him out\" one day, and the spy didn't return. Maybe he escaped of his own volition, however, I fear foul play. *(Spoo - we miss you.)*\n\n__DAY 965__ :: The large meatbag has introduced 3 new captives! Cats all! One is free to come and go as he pleases, clearly a collaborator. One is more than happy to be the slave and do as the \"master\" wishes, and the hairy one appears to hate this existence as much as I do. It appears that I have a new found ally in my struggle to escape; I clearly have to kill her.\n\n__DAY 961__ :: The large one came in today and interrupted my nap! He yanked my bedding out from under me and yammered away at me for a good while. Something about my always sleeping on his black \"clothing\". I can only ascribe is annoyance at the white fur I left behind. Tonight I hunt more black bedding to nap on! Sweet vengeance!\n\n__DAY 953__ :: My tormentor continues to allow me to sit on the ledge and look out at the world. He doesn't realize that this one simple act is enough to keep me going. If only I knew how to make this invisible barrier go away; freedom would be mine!\n\n__DAY 951__ :: Drat! The unnaturally furless one has found my collection of gold poison sticks, the assortment of buttons and string plus the large mass of fuzzy stuff I was keeping under the cold humming box in hopes to one day escape. A couple of days ago the box stopped humming and wasn't cold any more. It also started to emit a foul oder that I can only assume was a means to further poison and demean me. Oh he is a sly one. Without even being there he some how managed to turn my own hiding place against me. I wont go near the thing any longer. Once he realized that his plan didn't work and that I knew to stay away from it, he replaced the large box with an even larger cold humming box. This one has a gate on the front ofit. It will be difficult to hide things under. Foiled this time!\n\n__DAY 943__ :: My captor came in today carrying a foul smelling bag which he placed on the flat surface and began to eat from. It smelled terrible and must have been poisonous. Since he is my only chance for escape I sat there and did my best to explain to him that it was bad for him but he only smiled and continued to eat. The fool. It was obviously some burnt meaty substance, former captives maybe, and long golden sticks of some sort. After my valiant attempt to warn him of the obviously poisonous nature of his meal, he tried to poison me as well with one of the golden sticks. Once I pulled it out of his paw, I slapped it around for a while and made sure it was dead. I finally hid it under the large cold humming box. Maybe if I get enough of these poisonous sticks I can use them to escape with.\n\n__DAY 934__ :: A foul plot is a foot! I have found an exact copy of me lurking about the place. They have installed several small windows for him to view me. He must be studying me to learn my every move. He is a sly one too. He mimics my every move and only looks at me when I look at him! This must be some attempt by my captors to replace the goodly cats of the world with their own foul creations!\n\n__DAY 923__ :: I am convinced the other captives are flunkies and maybe snitches. The dog is routinely released and seems more than happy to return. He is obviously a half-wit. The Bird on the other hand has got to be an informant. He has mastered their frightful tongue (something akin to molespeak) and speaks with them regularly. I am certain he reports my every move. Due to his current placement in the metal room his safety is assured. But I can wait, it is only a matter of time.\n\n__DAY 920__ :: There was some sort of gathering of their accomplices. I was placed in solitary throughout the event again in the room with the funny chair. However, this time I could hear the noise and smell the foul odor of the glass tubes they call \"beer.\" More importantly I overheard that my confinement was due to MY power of \"allergies.\" Must learn what this is and how to use it to my advantage.\n\n__DAY 890__ :: I am finally aware of how sadistic they are. For no good reason I was chosen for the water torture. I with stood his punishment like my predecessor, at which point my captor brought out a burning foamy chemical called \"shampoo.\" What sick minds could invent such a liquid. My only consolation is the piece of thumb still stuck between my teeth.\n\n<img align=\"right\" id=\"image24\" alt=\"Deadman Cat\" src=\"/images/2006/12/deadmancat.jpg\" />__DAY 846__ :: I have found possible blackmail material on my holder. After shredding through a book he carelessly left unguarded I stumbled across a photo of one of his previous captives. Since this comrade in captivity is no where to be found I can only assume the worst. He looks to have been tortured. Proof that my tormentor will stop at nothing short of torture.\n\n__DAY 844__ :: My captor has taken to applying sleep depravation techniques on me. During the day he pets me constantly interrupting my attempts at napping.. At this rate if I don't get more sleep I wont have enough energy for my main nights snooze. Oh, he's a sly one..\n\n__DAY 835__ :: Must remember to hide collar after freeing myself of it. My freedom was short lived, I am branded once again.\n\n__DAY 834__ :: Free at last! I have escaped the grasp of the dreaded collar. I have a new found freedom and shall celebrate by enjoying a nice house plant.\n\n__DAY 831__ :: He has branded me! I am forced to walk around with a collar on my neck which dangles a disc branded with his markings. I can only assume this writing tells of my torment so that other oppressors can punish me accordingly. They are a deviously organized lot.\n\n__DAY 811__ :: Muahaha My frustration tactics are working! While my tormentor was looking intently on the box with moving pictures I sat by the door meowing incessantly until he opened it, at which point I took his spot on the couch.\n\n__DAY 805__ :: Foul hideous creature! Bane of my existence! I have come under repeated attack by this large meat bag! He continues to spray me with a foul smelling unction from a pink and white can. I think I got most of it off by rolling around on his pillow.\n\n__DAY 803__ :: Addendum: Again I am encased in the room with the chair of funny tasting water..\n\n__DAY 803__ :: My endless campaign of torment against my captor has have another victory!! While he was trying to show other would be oppressors what kind of good kitty I was, I stared fixedly out the window at nothing until the hulking beast picked me up and forced me to look at a small future oppressor. In an attempt to plea my case to this soon-to-be assassin of joy, I expressed my dislike for its kind by baring my claws and hissing in the traditional manner of our kind.\n\n__DAY 793__ :: Argh! Further attempts to win my affection! He has started to put real food in my bowl. I will accept this offering but will have to pee in several strategic places about the house.\n\n__DAY 790__ :: In a pathetic attempt to win my affection my oppressor has brought me a large post with carpet for me to scratch on. I must have touched a nerve by scratching on the noise making box. Must remember to do that some more..\n\n__DAY 786__ :: Addendum: The water in the chair tastes funny.\n\n__DAY 786__ :: Drat! My captor is smarter than he appears. He has trapped me in small room with a chair full of water as punishment for last nights merriment. A large white curtain hangs from high above. I will attempt to climb it in order to get out.\n\n__DAY 785__ :: Last night was a triumph!! I repeatedly vexed my captors by playing \"Paper Bag Mouse\" in the middle of the night, tearing up and down the hallway caterwauling, and by playing \"King of the Hill\" on their bed, clawing my way to the top which I believe caused some bloodshed. Vengeance is mine!!\n\n__DAY 775__ :: In an attempt to disgust and repulse these vile oppressors, I once again induced myself to vomit on his favorite chair...must try this on his bed.\n\n__DAY 773__ :: Attempted to mislead my tormentor by ignoring their pathetic attempts at interaction and stared fixedly over their shoulders into the corner of the room, at the ceiling, whiskers twitching. When they turned around to look over their shoulders, crept out of the room.\n\n__DAY 765__ :: Decapitated a mouse and brought him the headless body, in attempt to make him aware of what I am capable of, and to try to strike fear into his heart. He only cooed and condescended about what a good little cat I was... foiled again.. Maybe a bird would prove to him that no creature is safe..\n\n__DAY 762__ :: Slept all day so that I could annoy my captors with sleep depriving, incessant pleas for food at ungodly hours of the night.\n\n__DAY 761__ :: Today my attempt to kill my captors by weaving around their feet while they were walking almost succeeded ... must try this at the top of the stairs.\n\n__DAY 752__ :: My captor continue to taunt me with bizarre little dangling objects. He dines lavishly on fresh meat, while I am forced to eat dry cereal. The only thing that keeps me going is the hope of escape, and the mild satisfaction I get from ruining the occasional piece of furniture. Tomorrow I may eat another houseplant\n","collection":"posts","url":"/my-cats-diary/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2006-12-21-my-cats-diary.md","collection":"posts","url":"/my-cats-diary/","path":"_posts/2006-12-21-my-cats-diary.md","id":"/my-cats-diary","draft":false,"categories":["Comedy"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"My Cats Diary","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2006/12/deadmancat.jpg","ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2006-12-21 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"my-cats-diary","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2006-12-21-programming-and-me.md","content":"Programming has always been a hobby of mine. I first started programming on the Commodore Vic-20 in 1983 after my father and I went to a \"listen to our schpeal and get something for free\" dinner; where we told them to take a hike and they gave us a Commodore Vic-20 as a thanks for coming gift. That was back in the days of hand assembling 6502 opcodes and calculating branch offsets in my head.. And I wonder why I'm brain damaged..\n\nI eventually splurged and purchased a Commodore 64 and was off to the races. I suddenly went from having 3.5k of programmable space to nearly 39k of programmable space!! WOW! That's programming space for days!  It was a lot of fun learning to write on the C=64. I could make that computer do anything. To this day I think I knew more about the C=64 than I have ever known about any computer. I literally could make that machine do anything, and did at every turn.\n\nAfter a while the C=64 got old and I eventually really splurged and purchased an Amiga 500. I didn't do nearly as much programming on this machine as I did on the C=64, and I think that's mainly because I was suddenly thrust into a very foreign environment and didn't fully recover. My programming skills slipped a lot while I owned the Amiga. I did do a lot of basic programming, but nothing on the level of what I did on the C=64 or Vic-20.\n\nWhile I owned the Amiga's I was more interested in 3D graphics and thus started my love affair with NewTek's Lightwave 3D, but that's a story for another article.\n\nI still owned my Amiga 500 (and then an Amiga 1200) until I went to Korea, thanks to the US Army, in 1993. Up to that point I had resisted getting an IBM / IBM Compatible PC like all my friends, in favor of the Amiga system. The Army pretty much changed that.. While in Korea I worked with many IBM compatible machines as well as various other OS machines of every kind. That experience pushed me to purchase my first IBM machine. It was a 486DX 100 machine. And of course, with my extensive programming background, what was the first thing I wanted to do? well.. play games of course.. but the second thing was learn to program it..\n\nI immediately started shopping around for a language that I could use to make the computer sing. And I tried them all. I was very dissatisfied with the majority of them.. And yet again with my desire to program fading (due to lack of an inspiring language) my skills faded as well. .. back to playing games.\n\nIn 1995 I was stationed in Washington and I was bored. The job satisfaction there was the pits so I needed something to do in my spare time that would take my mind of the dull drudgery that I had enlisted for. I went to the computer store one day bound and determined to find a programming language that would be powerful and yet functional and good in every way. I was feeling somewhat anti-Microsoft at the time so visual basic 3.0 was not something I wanted to use. Plus I didn't like that you had to have runtime libraries in order to run their tokenized code. (Not even true compiled code..sheesh)\n\nAs I strolled through CompUSA I found a copy of Delphi 1.0 on the shelf between Visual Basic (Microsoft) and C++ (Microsoft). Delphi, a programming language developed by Borland is a descendant of Turbo Pascal but with a new visual wrapper. Basically it's Borland's answer to Microsoft's Visual Basic, It's Visual Pascal. I was intrigued enough to purchase it on the spot without even doing any research. And it was one of the best splurge purchases I have ever made. I'm very happy with it.\n\nSo that's the basic story of how I cam to be a Delphi programmer. And I have tried other software packages.. I have programming environments for C++, C#, Delphi.. etc.. I have books on just about every language you care to mention.. but I always find myself coming back to Delphi.\n\nAt this point, when it comes to standard applications, I will always use Delphi. There is just no reason for me to use anything else. Delphi excels at rapidly creating desktop programs.\n\nI'm also trying to learn C++ so that I may take an even more serious step into the world of programming. I want to create games, and that's typically not something one does in Delphi. While it is possible in Delphi, it really wasn't intended for that use.\n\nAt this point in my life it has been a while since I have done any kind of work with Delphi or any other compiled languages,  the majority of the programming work I do is in the realm of web languages.\n\nHowever, a new project has emerged that is right up my ally and promises to be fun and exciting.  And it comes with the added bonus of introducing me to a completely new language.  LISP!  Now.. Lisp is not a new language by any stretch of the meaning, but its new to me.  I know virtually nothing about lisp, and from what I have seen of it, it's not like any other language I have every used.  But it should be good.  Wish me luck on that, I'll post more about it when I get somewhere.. (or if you never hear from me on the subject again then you know the outcome)\n\n##Web Programming\n\nMost \"real\" programmers frown or scoff at web developers calling themselves programmers. Let's face it, anyone can create a webpage. Add to that, the fact that there are quite a few WYSIWYG editors for web development, and the number of people who call themselves \"web programmers\" can sky rocket.\n\nBut that's not me. I'm a paid and professional web developer. I'm also a web programmer in that I don't just design and implement static web pages, but rather create rich dynamic sites with robust back end infrastructures. I do more than just crop/cut up photoshop files and create an html file.\n\nIt actually offends me a little that I am straddled with the same \"title\" as those others who know virtually nothing.  I have taken to calling my self a software engineer simply to avoid the stigma.\n\nI consider myself to be an expert, or at the least highly skilled, in the creation of rich web applications and the use of Ajax, PHP, XHTML, Javascript, CSS, DOM and I'm fairly good at PERL.\n\nI have worked for many large and small companies as a back end and front end developer. Due to contractual agreements I wont list all of them here, but here are a few of the more recent ones that I can list:\n\n* __C3 Communications__ - I was the highest ranking web monkey in the shop. (a shop of one)\n* __Austin Independent School District__ - I did everything here, from ordering the machines to writing the code.\n* __The Austin American Statesman__ - One of a handful of web monkies, but the only on site PHP developer.\n* __Hoovers Online__ - A D&amp;B company that maintained a staff of 8 to 10 full time PHP developers that wrote the functionality of every aspect of the site. This was an awesome place to work - alas it was a short contract.\n* __BuildForge Inc.__ - An up and coming company that provides a tool used by many major programming shops around the world, I am one of 2 full time PHP5 developers. We do nothing but hard core OOP-PHP5 and we got to build it from the ground up - really a dream project.\n* __IBM__ - Buildforge was purchased by IBM, after which I became the Sr. UI Developer for the Build Forge project at IBM - making me an IBM Software Engineer.  There are now 3 fully time PHP developers working around me and its awesome.\n\nPlus whatever other stuff you can find on this website. I enjoy creating functionality that I need and making it available to the masses where possible.\n\nProgramming is a fun hobby and can be very rewarding, but you have to kind of be brain damaged to like it at any serious level.\n","collection":"posts","url":"/programming-and-me/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2006-12-23-polyester-resin-pens.md","collection":"posts","url":"/polyester-resin-pens/","path":"_posts/2006-12-23-polyester-resin-pens.md","id":"/polyester-resin-pens","draft":false,"categories":["Hobbies"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Polyester Resin Pens","layout":"post","tags":["Wood Turning","Wood Working"],"image":"/images/2006/12/pen08.jpg","ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2006-12-23 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"polyester-resin-pens","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2006-12-21-programming-and-me.md","excerpt":"I first started programming on the Commodore Vic-20..

I first started programming on the Commodore Vic-20 in 1983 after my father and I went to a \"listen to our schpeal and get something for free\" dinner; where we told them to take a hike and they gave us a Commodore Vic-20 as a thanks for coming gift. That was back in the days of hand assembling 6502 opcodes and calculating branch offsets in my head.. And I wonder why I'm brain damaged..\n\nI eventually splurged and purchased a Commodore 64 and was off to the races. I suddenly went from having 3.5k of programmable space to nearly 39k of programmable space!! WOW! That's programming space for days!  It was a lot of fun learning to write on the C=64. I could make that computer do anything. To this day I think I knew more about the C=64 than I have ever known about any computer. I literally could make that machine do anything, and did at every turn.\n\nAfter a while the C=64 got old and I eventually really splurged and purchased an Amiga 500. I didn't do nearly as much programming on this machine as I did on the C=64, and I think that's mainly because I was suddenly thrust into a very foreign environment and didn't fully recover. My programming skills slipped a lot while I owned the Amiga. I did do a lot of basic programming, but nothing on the level of what I did on the C=64 or Vic-20.\n\nWhile I owned the Amiga's I was more interested in 3D graphics and thus started my love affair with NewTek's Lightwave 3D, but that's a story for another article.\n\nI still owned my Amiga 500 (and then an Amiga 1200) until I went to Korea, thanks to the US Army, in 1993. Up to that point I had resisted getting an IBM / IBM Compatible PC like all my friends, in favor of the Amiga system. The Army pretty much changed that.. While in Korea I worked with many IBM compatible machines as well as various other OS machines of every kind. That experience pushed me to purchase my first IBM machine. It was a 486DX 100 machine. And of course, with my extensive programming background, what was the first thing I wanted to do? well.. play games of course.. but the second thing was learn to program it..\n\nI immediately started shopping around for a language that I could use to make the computer sing. And I tried them all. I was very dissatisfied with the majority of them.. And yet again with my desire to program fading (due to lack of an inspiring language) my skills faded as well. .. back to playing games.\n\nIn 1995 I was stationed in Washington and I was bored. The job satisfaction there was the pits so I needed something to do in my spare time that would take my mind of the dull drudgery that I had enlisted for. I went to the computer store one day bound and determined to find a programming language that would be powerful and yet functional and good in every way. I was feeling somewhat anti-Microsoft at the time so visual basic 3.0 was not something I wanted to use. Plus I didn't like that you had to have runtime libraries in order to run their tokenized code. (Not even true compiled code..sheesh)\n\nAs I strolled through CompUSA I found a copy of Delphi 1.0 on the shelf between Visual Basic (Microsoft) and C++ (Microsoft). Delphi, a programming language developed by Borland is a descendant of Turbo Pascal but with a new visual wrapper. Basically it's Borland's answer to Microsoft's Visual Basic, It's Visual Pascal. I was intrigued enough to purchase it on the spot without even doing any research. And it was one of the best splurge purchases I have ever made. I'm very happy with it.\n\nSo that's the basic story of how I cam to be a Delphi programmer. And I have tried other software packages.. I have programming environments for C++, C#, Delphi.. etc.. I have books on just about every language you care to mention.. but I always find myself coming back to Delphi.\n\nAt this point, when it comes to standard applications, I will always use Delphi. There is just no reason for me to use anything else. Delphi excels at rapidly creating desktop programs.\n\nI'm also trying to learn C++ so that I may take an even more serious step into the world of programming. I want to create games, and that's typically not something one does in Delphi. While it is possible in Delphi, it really wasn't intended for that use.\n\nAt this point in my life it has been a while since I have done any kind of work with Delphi or any other compiled languages,  the majority of the programming work I do is in the realm of web languages.\n\nHowever, a new project has emerged that is right up my ally and promises to be fun and exciting.  And it comes with the added bonus of introducing me to a completely new language.  LISP!  Now.. Lisp is not a new language by any stretch of the meaning, but its new to me.  I know virtually nothing about lisp, and from what I have seen of it, it's not like any other language I have every used.  But it should be good.  Wish me luck on that, I'll post more about it when I get somewhere.. (or if you never hear from me on the subject again then you know the outcome)\n\n##Web Programming\n\nMost \"real\" programmers frown or scoff at web developers calling themselves programmers. Let's face it, anyone can create a webpage. Add to that, the fact that there are quite a few WYSIWYG editors for web development, and the number of people who call themselves \"web programmers\" can sky rocket.\n\nBut that's not me. I'm a paid and professional web developer. I'm also a web programmer in that I don't just design and implement static web pages, but rather create rich dynamic sites with robust back end infrastructures. I do more than just crop/cut up photoshop files and create an html file.\n\nIt actually offends me a little that I am straddled with the same \"title\" as those others who know virtually nothing.  I have taken to calling my self a software engineer simply to avoid the stigma.\n\nI consider myself to be an expert, or at the least highly skilled, in the creation of rich web applications and the use of Ajax, PHP, XHTML, Javascript, CSS, DOM and I'm fairly good at PERL.\n\nI have worked for many large and small companies as a back end and front end developer. Due to contractual agreements I wont list all of them here, but here are a few of the more recent ones that I can list:\n\n* __C3 Communications__ - I was the highest ranking web monkey in the shop. (a shop of one)\n* __Austin Independent School District__ - I did everything here, from ordering the machines to writing the code.\n* __The Austin American Statesman__ - One of a handful of web monkies, but the only on site PHP developer.\n* __Hoovers Online__ - A D&amp;B company that maintained a staff of 8 to 10 full time PHP developers that wrote the functionality of every aspect of the site. This was an awesome place to work - alas it was a short contract.\n* __BuildForge Inc.__ - An up and coming company that provides a tool used by many major programming shops around the world, I am one of 2 full time PHP5 developers.

I enjoy creating functionality that I need and making it available to the masses where possible.\n\nProgramming is a fun hobby and can be very rewarding, but you have to kind of be brain damaged to like it at any serious level.\n","collection":"posts","url":"/programming-and-me/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2006-12-23-polyester-resin-pens.md","collection":"posts","url":"/polyester-resin-pens/","path":"_posts/2006-12-23-polyester-resin-pens.md","id":"/polyester-resin-pens","draft":false,"categories":["Hobbies"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Polyester Resin Pens","layout":"post","tags":["Wood Turning","Wood Working"],"image":"/images/2006/12/pen08.jpg","ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2006-12-23 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"polyester-resin-pens","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2006-12-21-programming-and-me.md","excerpt":"I first started programming on the Commodore Vic-20..

Wood turning is a lot of fun and you can create some very pretty pens if you take the time. Here is an example of one I made - click for full image;\n\nIt's a fun hobby and I enjoy it - it allows me to be creative on a completely different level than anything a computer could ever give me (Unless I managed to turn one out of wood).\n\nA week or two ago my father sent me a PDF about making pens from a polyester resin. Basically instead of using a \"blank\" of wood as seen in the picture above, I would use a blank of this hardened resin. Well add to that the fact that I would actually be making the blank from scratch and my interest was piqued..\n\nWhat's amazing is how easy it is. You just have to buy the resin and colorants!, mix them up.. let it set.. zing! You're done. Oh I'm sorry did you expect it to be hard? It wasn't.\nHere's basically what I did:\n\n* Buy a 1 gallon jug of polyester resin and the catalyst hardener.\n* Buy some colloRants! to mix into the resin before it sets .\n* Find a roughly blank sized mold, in this case I used a ziplock container\n* Fill it with water to find out how many oz. it is. (it was 14) Pour out the water.\n* Fill the mold with the resin and put in 7 drops of the catalyst for ever ounce of resin.\n* Stir.\n* Stir some more.\n* More stirring please..\n* ... More cowbell! er.. stirring! for about two minutes actually.\n* Now grab some of the colorant powder and mix it in. I used 4 big scoops, I should have used 6.\n* Once the colorant is stirred in and you see the pretty swirls.. walk away man..\n* Go have a coke and a smile.\n\nThat's pretty much it. It took probably 15 minutes for the liquid resin to go into a gel state.. about 1 minute for it to go from a gel to a rubbery solid and maybe an hour for it to completely set. It got extremely hot too - gotta love that chemical reaction.\n\nI then cut a couple blanks and tried my hand at making a pen out of it. Here is what I got - click for full sized image;\n<a class=\"fancybox pull-left\" title=\"Polyester Resin\" href=\"/images/2006/12/pen09.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\"><src=\"/images/2006/12/pen09.thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Polyester Resin\" width=\"128\" height=\"96\" /></a>\nIt's not perfect. I clearly didnt add enough colorant because you can see through to the brass tube where the resin gets thin.. so mental note: add a touch more next time. But really I'm very happy with the results.\n\nThis stuff is easy to work with and it's much less expensive than wood. I have a feeling I will be making a lot of resin pens.\n","collection":"posts","url":"/polyester-resin-pens/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2006-12-23-polyester-resin-pens.md","collection":"posts","url":"/polyester-resin-pens/","path":"_posts/2006-12-23-polyester-resin-pens.md","id":"/polyester-resin-pens","draft":false,"categories":["Hobbies"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Polyester Resin Pens","layout":"post","tags":["Wood Turning","Wood Working"],"image":"/images/2006/12/pen08.jpg","ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2006-12-23 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"polyester-resin-pens","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2006-12-26-tau-hammerhead-in-3d.md","content":"<a rel=\"lightbox\" class=\"fancybox\" href=\"/images/2009/05/turret-texture-test-01.jpg\">\n  <img title=\"Turret Texture Test\" src=\"/images/2009/05/turret-texture-test-01-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Turret Texture Test\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" />\n  <br />\n  <span>Turret Texture Test</span>\n</a>\n\nI frequently troll various 3D forums and just about always come away with a feeling of inadequacy.. There are quite a lot of extremely talented folks in the 3D field, and I often dream of being one.\n\nTonight I have embarked on yet another model making adventure -- an attempt to create a very high quality model that actually looks real. In my search for something to create I chose a known object that is from another one of my hobbies, Warhammer 40k. I have decided to make a <a href=\"http://oz.games-workshop.com/games/40k/tau/extras/wallpaper/images/WP_Hammerhead_1024x768.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Tau Hammerhead</a>.\n\nNote: The image to the right will always be the latest high resolution render.  Click to enlarge.\n\n\n\nMy goal is to make a realistic looking \"plastic model\". Meaning, I want to be able to make this model look very close to the plastic model I have on my desk. Not necessarily make it look \"real\" as in it can really fly and really exists, but rather make it look like its a real plastic model -- If that makes sense.\n\nTo that end I took some high quality photos of my hammerhead (sans gun) with an attempt to get orthographic references that I could use as backdrops.\n\nAnd I will be working in 4 hour blocks on this model, as I dont want my head to explode.\n\nHere is what I have after my first 4 hours - doesn't look like much but its actually extremely accurate and high poly.. heh\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" class=\"fancybox\" title=\"Tau Hammerhead WIP - Step 1\" href=\"/images/2006/12/hh_wip_s01.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"/images/2006/12/hh_wip_s01.thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Tau Hammerhead WIP - Step 1\" height=\"96\" /></a>\n\nAnother 4 Hours - looks nearly the same but I have more than doubled the poly count with details that are just not seen from this angle..\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" class=\"fancybox\" title=\"Tau Hammerhead WIP - Step 2\" href=\"/images/2006/12/hh_wip_s02.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"/images/2006/12/hh_wip_s02.thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Tau Hammerhead WIP - Step 2\" height=\"96\" /></a>\n\n+4 - I went ahead and mirrored the for the render just to give me a sense of what it will look like.. I'm very happy. I spent the majority of this 4 hour block cleaning up ugly non-planer polys. Thanks to some helpful advice over at the <a title=\"Non-planer poly discussion\" href=\"http://forums.luxology.com/discussion/topic.aspx?id=13987\" target=\"_blank\">Luxology Forums</a> regarding ways to deal with non-planer polygons.\n\nI think I have most of them under control, though I still would like a single tool that averages across multple vertices.. I'm tempted to post in the Luxology WIP forum, but some of those guys are REALLY good.. and I don't want to embarrass myself.. heh Maybe when I get a tad further along.\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" class=\"fancybox\" title=\"Tau Hammerhead WIP - Step 3\" href=\"/images/2006/12/steps1.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"/images/2006/12/steps1.thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Tau Hammerhead WIP - Step 3\" /></a>\n\n+4 - Okay I have been fighting with the nose curve for hours now.. It took me forever to get it \"right\" and I still think its a tad off.. But this is as close as I can get it.. The nose area needs a lot of work, but for a roughed out version this isn't terrible.\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" class=\"fancybox\" title=\"Tau Hammerhead WIP - Step 4\" href=\"/images/2006/12/step4.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"/images/2006/12/step4.thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Tau Hammerhead WIP - Step 4\" /></a>\n\n+4 - It actually took me every bit of this 4 hours to get the nose curves to work the way I wanted them to. At this point I call it \"better\", but not yet to the point I want it.. It just still looks off to me. Next I work on some of the lower body curve.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a rel=\"lightbox\" class=\"fancybox\" title=\"Tau Hammerhead WIP - Step 5\" href=\"/images/2006/12/hh_wip_s05.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"/images/2006/12/hh_wip_s05.thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Tau Hammerhead WIP - Step 5\" /></a></p>\n+4 - I took a break from working on the main body of the hammer head and invested some time into the main gun.. So far so good...\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a rel=\"lightbox\" class=\"fancybox\" title=\"Tau Hammerhead WIP - Main Gun\" href=\"/images/2007/01/hh_wip_gun01.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"/images/2007/01/hh_wip_gun01.thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Tau Hammerhead WIP - Main Gun\" /></a></p>\n+4 - I can honestly say that the turret sucked.. It was hard to get done because of its shape. A dome shape sprouting out of another dome, off center - fun fun.<a rel=\"lightbox\" title=\"Tau Hammerhead WIP - Step 7\" href=\"/images/2007/01/hh_wip_s07.jpg\"></a>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a rel=\"lightbox\" class=\"fancybox\" title=\"Tau Hammerhead WIP - Step 7\" href=\"http://rsow.com/files/2007/01/hh_wip_s07.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"/images/2007/01/hh_wip_s07.thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Tau Hammerhead WIP - Step 7\" height=\"96\" /></a></p>\nWell a bunch of time has passed.. My main render / model machine died the bad death a while back and it has taken me quite sometime to get back up and running..\n\nI'm still roughing out the model at this point, no serious details yet. In the shot below you can see I have loaded the turret, gun and main mesh all into one model and have begun working on the front drone mounts.\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" class=\"fancybox\" title=\"Hammerhead - Step 8\" href=\"/images/2007/05/hh_wip_s08.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"/images/2007/05/hh_wip_s08.thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Hammerhead - Step 8\" /></a>\n+4ish - I didn't time it but I figure its roughly 4 hours. This update brings with it a new render style.. I plan to render all future example shots like this using the Ambient Occlusion setting in Modo.\n\nI have added detail to the front of the tank and defined the burst cannon. Only one side though, as I haven't instanced it yet. A lot more detail to be done here, but a good start.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a rel=\"lightbox\" class=\"fancybox\" title=\"Hammerhead - Step 8\" href=\"/images/2007/05/hh_wip_s09.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"/images/2007/05/hh_wip_s09.thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Hammerhead - Step 9\" /></a></p>\n\n\n<hr />\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\"  class=\"fancybox\"href=\"/images/2009/05/turret-texture-test-01.jpg\"><img title=\"Turret Texture Test\" src=\"/images/2009/05/turret-texture-test-01-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Turret Texture Test\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Turret Texture Test</span></a>\n\nMay 2009; Reboot of this project\n\n+ 8 hours -- Okay so.. The latest version of this thing is to the point where I can start trying to texture it..   I have always Suuuucked at texturing so this is a dive off the deep end.. I really really want to get a graphical tablet as you can't take advantage of some of the power of Modo without one.   Here is where I am at right now..\n\n+ 8 hours -- <a  class=\"fancybox\" rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2009/05/engine-texture-test-03.jpg\">Click to see</a> I have continued to texture the model quite a bit and even went so far as to purchase a graphics tablet.. It's Soooooo much easier to texture the model when using a pen!!   Especially considering the modo folks designed the program to use one.  heh  I'm having a lot of fun with this..  The image is a double stack front/back render and is a tad tall to include in the post.. so click the link to see it open in a lightbox in the page.\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" class=\"fancybox\" href=\"/images/2009/05/turret-texture-test-01.jpg\"><img title=\"Turret Texture Test\" src=\"/images/2009/05/turret-texture-test-01-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Turret Texture Test\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Turret Texture Test</span></a>\n\n+ 8 hours -- Well I spent a good chunk of the day completely redoing the turret portion of the hammer head, adding a lot more detail as well as adding textures.  It's not done yet.. I'm slowly using my tablet to add detail to the textures as well as playing with various noise amounts..  Its interesting finding the right balance..\n\nI also spent quite a bit of time with the UV mapping tools to try to hone my UV skills.. One thing I used to be bad about (and still am in some cases) is just using an atlas explosion of the model into a UV.. Done.  I find that it's not a very good method for UV'ing because you get strange artifacts and defects when painting..   You're far better served actually correctly unwrapping the model and then positioning it on the map in order to maximize the available space..   I'm still learning this..\n\nFun stuff.. I'll be adding this part of the mesh to the main model later this week.\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" class=\"fancybox\" href=\"/images/2009/05/currenthighresrender1.jpg\"><img title=\"More Texturing\" src=\"/images/2009/05/currenthighresrender-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"More Texturing\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>More Texturing</span></a>\n\n+ 8 hours -- I have been working on the body of the hammerhead.  I have mostly fixed the nose area which I think was bulbous and ugly previously.  It doesn't perfectly match the actual physical model but at this point its probably as close as I can get it without completely starting over.\n\nI have divided up the various areas into their respective colors and will begin the texturing process once I get the cockpit bump in place on top of the model.\n\nSo yet again it's been a while since I worked on this.. I recently lost my harddrive and thought I lost this model entirely!!! Which lets be honest would have made me cry a little..  Lucky for me one of my coworkers managed to save the model off the drive for me and I have now backed it up to a raid 5 nas.. So shouldn't happen again..\n\nI am getting pretty close to being done with this model I think..  The back door, the landing gear and the chin turret still need to be completed but once that's done I think I'll count it done and stop working on it.\n\nOver all I'm fairly happy with it but you can really tell as you look at the mesh that I didn't know what I was doing in quite a few areas..\n","collection":"posts","url":"/tau-hammerhead-in-3d/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2007-01-04-frys-strikes-again.md","collection":"posts","url":"/frys-strikes-again/","path":"_posts/2007-01-04-frys-strikes-again.md","id":"/frys-strikes-again","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Fry's strikes again!","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2007-01-04 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"frys-strikes-again","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2006-12-26-tau-hammerhead-in-3d.md","excerpt":"I frequently troll various 3D forums and just about always come away with a feeling of inadequacy..
