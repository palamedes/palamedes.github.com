But I have never owned a high quality camera.  This week I was given the opportunity by my company to purchase a high quality camera for some projects we are working on.  I was totally stoked!\n\nMy brother is a Nikon fan and he does really well with them, but I have always been partial to Canon.  I really have no good reason for that other than my past experiences with their equipment and costumer service.\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2013/06/meeko_flatdog.jpg\" class=\"pull-left fancybox\"><img title=\"He was getting tired.\" src=\"/images/2013/06/meeko_flatdog.jpg\" alt=\"He was getting tired.\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>He was getting tired.</span></a>\n\nI own a Canon G1 Powershot (the first one in the line) and it always served me well until it was simply eclipsed by time and technology.  I have a Canon XL1 movie camera which again, great piece of equipment but at this point is completely outdated.  And a Canon Powershot SD770IS \"elph\" which is a great little pocket point and shoot..  but I wanted a camera I can really put to the test and get the full experience.\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2013/06/meeko_catdog.jpg\" class=\"pull-right fancybox\"><img title=\"Catdog!\" src=\"/images/2013/06/meeko_catdog.jpg\" alt=\"Catdog!\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>He's our Cat-dog.</span></a>\n\nI opt'ed to get the Canon EOS 6D full frame and couldn't be happier.. What a monster!\n\nI plan to take a lot of photos to learn how to make this thing work and perform prior to our project which is still hush-hush.\n\nMeeko does make for some fun shooting through.  He likes to sleep on the back of the couch.  He's the most cat like dog I've ever seen.\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2013/06/duck.jpg\" class=\"pull-left fancybox\"><img title=\"Ducks!\" src=\"/images/2013/06/duck.jpg\" alt=\"Ducks!\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Okay it's official.</span></a>\n\nAlso according to one of the photography websites I troll, the first official photo with your camera is supposed to be of ducks.. No clue why.. but I went out and found some ducks and took photos.. I have a lot but I find they are kinda boring subjects..\n\n---\n\nAlso, I am not really happy with the look of the blog.  The more I look at it, the more I hate it - and I'm not done converting it from wordpress.. hah\n\nI think I will continue working on the conversion but at the same time I want to invest some time in making it look better.. Frankly, it's boring, ugly and trying to do too much.  The real issue I have is that right now \"Flat\" is in.  Apparently Microsoft did something right as everyone is emulating their flat design on Windows 8, including Apple with their OS7 update soon to hit.\n\nI have to admit I'm torn..\n\nPart of me thinks its ugly, but I can see the appeal and It could grow on me.  I'm pondering a redesign.  I'm thinking a combination of dynamicly loaded flat design and more traditional SAAS application design.  I'll keep you posted.\n","collection":"posts","url":"/meeko-photography-and-look/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2013-06-30-meeko-photography-and-look.md","collection":"posts","url":"/meeko-photography-and-look/","path":"_posts/2013-06-30-meeko-photography-and-look.md","id":"/meeko-photography-and-look","draft":false,"categories":["Photography"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"My new Camera & Flat design","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2013/06/meeko_volunteer.jpg","gallery":["/images/2013/06/meeko_volunteer.jpg","/images/2013/06/meeko_flatdog.jpg","/images/2013/06/meeko_catdog.jpg","/images/2013/06/duck.jpg"],"ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2013-06-30 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"meeko-photography-and-look","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2013-07-07-yellow-flowers.md","content":"Now that I have my Canon 6D I need to start participating in some of the photography challenges that my brother puts on.

Well apparently I do alright myself!\n\nI want a nice shop outside my house that I can disappear into and make stuff, but that's not really a luxury I can afford at the moment. (Not a money issue, but a space issue... no room for a shop.)  So I have to do all my wood working in the garage, and space is extremely limited.\n\nI got it into my head that I could build a small flip-top workbench that I could mount my lathe and scroll saw to, then just flip it to the side I needed.  This would save a lot of space but there are no commercially available flip-top work benches that I could find.  (Apparently sears used to sell a 3 sided one but its long gone.)\n\nSo last sunday I went to the hardware store and got the various pieces I needed to follow through with my plan to build my workbench.  48 hours later I'm pretty far along.\n\nIt's still not complete as you can see in the photos but its close!  The fliptop works smooth as butter and once I get the latching system installed it should be quite stable.\n\nI'm very excited.\n\nAdditional:  I added 5 more images of the now mostly completed workbench.  You can clearly see the jet mini lathe mounted to one side, and my dewalt scroll saw mounted to the other.   Both have ample room to add more tools tool.  (My grinder/sander will be to the left of the lathe and my miter saw will be to the right of the scroll saw..)\n\nWin.","collection":"posts","url":"/flip-top-workbench/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2013-08-25-banjo-clock-its-alive.md","collection":"posts","url":"/banjo-clock-its-alive/","path":"_posts/2013-08-25-banjo-clock-its-alive.md","id":"/banjo-clock-its-alive","draft":false,"categories":["Hobbies"],"published":"trie","type":"post","title":"Banjo Clock: It's Alive!","layout":"post","tags":["Wood Working"],"image":"/images/2013/08/banjoclock01.jpg","gallery":["/images/2013/08/banjoclock01.jpg"],"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"tile_class":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2013-08-25 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"banjo-clock-its-alive","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2013-08-13-flip-top-workbench.md","excerpt":"Both of my grandfathers were darn good carpenters, and my father is too though he wont much admit it.
