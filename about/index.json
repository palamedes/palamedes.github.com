Palamedes outwitted Odysseus, making him join the expedition against Troy. For that reason Odysseus was hostile to Palamedes; and during the war Odysseus, having taken a Trojan prisoner, compelled him to write a letter of treasonable purport ostensibly sent by Priam to Palamedes; and having buried gold in the quarters of Palamedes, dropped the letter in the camp. Agamemnon read the letter, found the gold, and delivered up Palamedes to the allies to be stoned as a traitor.\n\n*__In Detail:__* Palamedes, inventor of the dice and of several letters of the alphabet, outwitted Odysseus, making him join the expedition against Troy. But Odysseus became hostile to him and Palamedes' cleverness proved fatal to himself. Palamedes and knowledge Contributions to knowledge. The contributions of Palamedes to knowledge were of such a nature that they have been named together with those made by the Egyptians and the Phoenicians. For the Egyptians, they say, were the first to represent thought by symbols and pictures of animals. These symbols are among the most ancient and, having being impressed upon stone, they are still visible today. And some have believed that the Phoenicians took the idea of the alphabet from the Egyptians and then imported it into Greece, being as they were predominant at sea. For it was Cadmus, they say, who taught the art of writing to the uncivilised Greeks, after having arrived with a Phoenician fleet. Many letters invented by Palamedes. King Cecrops of Athens has been also counted among those who promoted civilization. But during the time of the Trojan War, Palamedes of Argos was one of the most brilliant, having invented eleven letters of the alphabet or, as others say, sixteen.\n\n*What this knowledge lacks;* Now, it has been remarked, that this kind of knowledge, which is good in the sense that it provides various skills, is not enough in order to learn what may be of real advantage for each person and for the community. For lawful, just, and harmonious life in social and political relations has never been learned, and instead wronging and plotting against one another has often prevailed with terrible results even for men of knowledge. Knowledge did not save Palamedes. And in the same way as power and wealth did not save Agamemnon from being murdered or Oedipus from falling into utter ruin, knowledge and the invention of the letters could not save Palamedes from being stoned by the same men who he had instructed. For the Achaeans, they say, did not even know how to count the host, and when they had learned this from Palamedes and had themselves become clever and proficient, then they slew him.\n\n*Story of Palamedes The Oath of Tyndareus;* Because of the Oath of Tyndareus it was the duty of many rulers in Greece to join the coalition that was being formed for the purpose of sailing to Troy and obtain, either by words or by force, the restoration of Helen and the Spartan property that had been stolen by the seducer Paris.\n\n*Odysseus' reasons to avoid the war;* When the envoys Palamedes, Menelaus and Nestor, arrived to Ithaca in order to remind Odysseus of the oath he had sworn and consequently join the expedition, they met difficulties, for Odysseus had been warned by an oracle that if he went to Troy he would return home alone and in need, with his comrades lost, after twenty years. Palamedes is not tricked by Odysseus. And that is why Odysseus, not wishing to go to war, feigned madness. But Palamedes, seeing through the deception, snatched little Telemachus, Odysseus' son, from Penelope's bosom and drew his sword pretending that he would kill him. So Odysseus, fearing for his son's life, confessed that his madness was fictitious and accepted to go to war. But others say that when Odysseus learned that spokesmen would come to him, he put on a cap and, pretending madness, yoked a horse and an ox to the plow. Palamedes, they say, noticing that Odysseus was performing a farce, took his son Telemachus from the cradle and put him in front of the plow exhorting Odysseus to give up his pretence. Then Odysseus promised to join the allies, but from that time he was hostile to Palamedes, though The Oath of Tyndareus that bound him had been his Odysseus' invention as well.\n\n*Odysseus plots against Palamedes;* So having come to the front at Troy, Odysseus, never forgetting that he had been outwitted by Palamedes, kept plotting night and day against him. Some say that Odysseus compelled a Trojan prisoner to write a letter of treasonable purport, which seemed to be sent by King Priam of Troy to Palamedes, and that he dropped the letter in the camp to be found and at the same time buried gold in the quarters of Palamedes. Others have said that Odysseus, referring to a warning in a dream, convinced Agamemnon to move the Achaean camp for one day, and hid by night a great quantity of gold in the place where Palamedes' tent had been. Odysseus also gave to a Trojan prisoner a letter to be carried to King Priam, and sent a soldier of his ahead to kill him not far away from the camp. So when the army returned the next day to the camp a soldier found the letter on the body of the dead Trojan prisoner. And on it it was written: \"Sent to Palamedes from Priam\" promising him as much gold as Odysseus had hidden if he would betray the camp according to agreement.\n\n*Palamedes found guilty of treason;* This is how Palamedes lost his life through an unjust judgement. For the next day, when Palamedes was brought before Agamemnon, he denied having betrayed the army, but he was not able to convince either the king or anyone else of his innocence, after soldiers went to his tent and dug up the gold that sly Odysseus had hidden.\n\n*Palamedes' death;* And so Palamedes was stoned to death by the entire army. But others say that there was not such a plot and that Palamedes was drowned by Odysseus and Diomedes, when he put out to catch fish.\n\n*Ajax recalls the incident in Ithaca;* After Achilles' death, when Ajax and Odysseus competed for his arms, the former recalled the circumstances that forced Odysseus to come to Troy to show the judges that he was a better man and deserved the arms of Achilles: \"Shall Odysseus appear the better man who came last to arms and by feigned madness shirked the war, till one more shrewd than he...the son of Nauplius, uncovered this timid fellow's trick and dragged him forth to the arms that he shunned? Shall he take the best because he wanted to take none ? And shall I go unhonoured...just because I was the first to front the danger ?\" [Ajax. Ovid, Metamorphoses 13.34]\n\n*Palamedes' father claims satisfaction;* When Palamedes' father, Nauplius, learned that calumny and a miscarriage of justice had killed his son, he sailed to the Troad and, meeting the leaders of the Achaean army, claimed satisfaction. But all of them favoured Agamemnon, who protected Odysseus, and so Nauplius returned unsuccessful.\n\n*Contribution of Palamedes' brother;* Agamemnon did not perish at cape Caphareus, for the wind bore him to his own shores. But Oeax, in order to avenge the wrong done to his brother Palamedes, let Agamemnon's wife Clytaemnestra know that Cassandra, daughter of King Priam of Troy, was being brought as a concubine to her house. And on his arrival Agamemnon was murdered by his wife and her lover Aegisthus.\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2000-01-01-jason-ellis-resume.md","url":"/jason-ellis-resume/","relative_path":"_posts/2000-01-01-jason-ellis-resume.md","id":"/jason-ellis-resume","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":[],"published":true,"type":"page","title":"Resume","layout":"page","tags":[],"image":"/images/cruise/Cruise%20089.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":false,"date":"2000-01-01 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"jason-ellis-resume","ext":".md"},"url":"/palamedes-historical-reference/","relative_path":"_posts/2000-01-01-palamedes-historical-reference.md","id":"/palamedes-historical-reference","collection":"posts","excerpt":"Palamedes, son of Nauplius, is the inventor of the dice and of several letters of the alphabet.

Palamedes originally was a member of the Greek expedition against Troy and made an enemy of Odysseus by exposing him when he pretended to be mad in order to avoid going to war.  In revenge, Odysseus made it look as if Palamedes had been betraying the Greeks to the Trojans in return for gold and caused Palamedes to be put to death.  The inventor of dice as well as several of the letters in our alphabet, all sources depicted Palamedes as clever... right up until the end I guess.\n\n##Vihravendrel\n\nTescht Vihravendrel Ambjuri'Belshiva is a fantasy character name that I have used for years and years in every game imaginable. From Warhammer and D&amp;D to Everquest and World of Warcraft.

I'm 40+ year old software engineer and small business owner.  (41 at time of writing, I say 40 plus because who knows how long it will be before I update this..)\n\nI've worked for many companies, big and small, in my software engineering career.  For example, I was a software engineer for IBM for 6 years, specifically working on their Build Forge product as the Senior UI Developer.  And I've worked for other very large companies, or children there of like Dunn and Bradstreet, Cox Media, US Army.. etc..\n\nAfter I graduated from those awful \"Dilbert/Office Space\" like environments I started intentionally working for small start-up like companies in the Austin area as a software engineer/architect and enjoy it much more..\n\nI'm an avid programmer, coding all manner of rich web applications using languages, frameworks and protocols such as Ruby, Ruby on Rails, PHP, Zend, Doctrine, Javascript, Java, AJAX, JSON, XSLT, XML, XHTML DOM, ORM, CSS, and every other trendy acronym you care to throw in there.. When it comes to web development, I've done it - most of it professionally.\n\n##Hobbies\n\nMy hobbies include just about anything you can think of; I consider myself a very craftsy person and really enjoy making things. I make or have made armor (chain, leather, plate), bows & crossbow, clocks, and really enjoy turning wood as well as general wood working.\n\nI also enjoy reading and writing, though I will be the first to admit I'm not the greatest writer in the world.  I find that writing is actually quite difficult, and it only takes one gander at the blog here to realize my talents likely lie elsewhere..\n\nI am an avid game player and have plans in the works to create my very own ( who doesn't? ).  I enjoy MMO style games though I'm very tired of the current fantasy trend of games.  I would like some kind of futuristic space style game that doesn't punish me for playing.\n\nMusically, I have aspirations to play the piano and have even purchased a very nice keyboard with intent to play it one day, but just haven't managed to find the time.  I also am very keen to learn to play the chapman stick as it's got to be one of the coolest instruments on Arrakis, but I just haven't had time.\n\nI am interested in <a href=\"/tag/3d_graphics/\">3D graphics</a> and animation and consider myself a very good 3d modeler, though as with all things I could be better.\n\nI used to be an extreme paintball player and by extreme I mean I played a lot. I started playing in 1987 and continued to play it occasionally though I'm burned out on it now. I played semi-pro, doing the whole master circuit thing for a while to include being a head field ref for Zap Masters and Zap International Open, but in the end -- the game has gone a direction I just don't enjoy so I have mostly gotten out of it.  Though like I said, I do still go out occasionally with friends to play..\n\nOh and I <a href=\"/programming-and-me/\">program a bit</a> as well.  It's what I have done for a liveing for over 20 years.\n\n##US Army\n\nMy life to date has been a good one - I can't complain about anything. Right after high school my father got remarried, so I decided it was time for me to get out of the house so that he and his new wife could have a life together without me in the way..\n\nI decided to join the Army - or maybe it was decided for me .. not sure. I'm forced to thank my step brother for this one though as it was his idea (he made it sound so cool - he was doing it at the time), and it was a good idea at that, though the recruiter lied about pretty much everything.\n\nWhile the army in and of itself sucked, I met some of the best people in the world and am still friends with most of them. I got to do some very cool things while in the military and I got to go to some very.. interesting.. places.\n\nGlad it's over now. I tell people all the time, \"The Army's over all experience was excellent - the individual minutes sucked.\"  I'm sure this is true of all military branches.\n\nThings are always better when you look back at them. Sometimes I can't believe how long ago it was; It seems like only yesterday - boy how time flies. At this point I have been out of the army for three times the length of time I was in, and that just seems strange. Those days that took forever to go by, now seem very distant and that they went by in a flash.\n\nI was in the army for 5 years as a 98CKP, for those of you who have no idea what that is, I was a signals intelligence analyst and a Korean linguist - I make a mean cup of coffee for the golfs who are reading this. I'll also note that's an MOS that's no longer around so apparently we are a dying breed..\n\nThe job sounded cool! It wasn't. Actually it was damn boring - I ended up fixing trucks in the motor pool more than anything.\n\n##Palavista.com\n\nAfter I got out of the military I started my own business on the world wide web. (I have a long history of entrepreneurial endevours.) I created the very first digital music metacrawler that searched the internet for MP3s. It did very well and really got me back into programming after my military hiatus.\n\nAfter 2 years of development I ended up selling Palavista to a company in New York (ChangeMusic inc.) for $330k. And proceeded to retire for a couple years. It's a shame, they did nothing with it.  But then that's because about 2 weeks after I sold it, napster came out and it was all over for them.. I got out just in time..\n\n<a href=\"/images/2017/cop_pic.jpg\" class=\"fancybox pull-right\" title=\"Jason Ellis in uniform\"><img title=\"Jason Ellis in uniform\" src=\"/images/2017/cop_pic.jpg\" alt=\"Jason Ellis in uniform\" width=\"240\" /></a>\n\n\n##Law Enforcement\n\nAfter my early retirement back in 2001 (read: once I got bored) I decided to go into law enforcement. I worked for several years as a police officer in two different cities in central Texas.  I had some bad experiences with the departments I worked for and decided to get out of it.\n\nPart of me missed it because it had the camaraderie of the military and a very minor sense of celebrity in that it felt like you were doing something important.  I also never felt like I gave it a fair shake even though I did it for nearly 2 years.  I decided, it was time to give it a try again here in Georgia after \"the great software burnout of 2017\".  I'm still an officer today.\n\n---\n\nThat's me in a nut shell - of course there is a lot more to know but you'll have to read the rest of the site to get it. This site is as much a peripheral part of my brain as it is anything else. I write this stuff for my own pleasure, and not for you. If you find any enjoyment out of any of my ramblings then fantastic, but I did it for me.\n\nOne thing you may notice, I don't use spell checker, and I really should. Sorry about that - please forgive any typos.\n\nKeep in mind, this site is my very own oubliette of rambles, Rants! and stories. If you get offended by any of it, that's on you. You're in my sandbox now. In the end, my writing style is my own be it good, bad or ugly... I'm the one at the keyboard.\n","previous":null,"url":"/about/","relative_path":"_posts/1972-06-09-about.md","id":"/about","collection":"posts","excerpt":"I am a calm, considerate problem solver.

Palamedes originally was a member of the Greek expedition against Troy and made an enemy of Odysseus by exposing him when he pretended to be mad in order to avoid going to war.  In revenge, Odysseus made it look as if Palamedes had been betraying the Greeks to the Trojans in return for gold and caused Palamedes to be put to death.  The inventor of dice as well as several of the letters in our alphabet, all sources depicted Palamedes as clever... right up until the end I guess.\n\n##Vihravendrel\n\nTescht Vihravendrel Ambjuri'Belshiva is a fantasy character name that I have used for years and years in every game imaginable. From Warhammer and D&amp;D to Everquest and World of Warcraft.  It sometimes gets reduced to just Vihravendrel or even shorter to just Vihra or Vihr.\n\n<a href=\"/images/2009/07/toiletduck-200x200.jpg\" class=\"fancybox pull-left\" title=\"Toiletduck!

Coined back in 1999 when TFC was first released, I chose this name when I became an administrator on some servers that were real toilets and were in desperate need of cleaning..  \"[Toilet Duck](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toilet_Duck)\" was a toilet bowl cleaner back in the 80's.\n\n---\n\nAll three names I have come to identify with, and were you to call out using one of them, I would answer -- all three names are me, and yet none of them are...\n\n<a href=\"/images/cruise/Cruise%20089.jpg\" class=\"fancybox pull-right\" title=\"I'm the one on the right...\"><img title=\"I'm the one on the right...\" src=\"/images/cruise/Cruise%20089.jpg\" alt=\"I'm the one on the right...\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /><br /><span>I'm the one on the right...</span></a>\n\n\n##Jason Ellis - <small>[Resume](/jason-ellis-resume/)</small>\n\n<img style=\"border: 0px;\" title=\"Email Address\" src=\"/images/2008/06/email.gif\" alt=\"My Email Address\" width=\"146\" height=\"14\" />\n\nMy real name is Jason Ellis. I'm 40+ year old software engineer and small business owner.  (41 at time of writing, I say 40 plus because who knows how long it will be before I update this..)\n\nI've worked for many companies, big and small, in my software engineering career.  For example, I was a software engineer for IBM for 6 years, specifically working on their Build Forge product as the Senior UI Developer.  And I've worked for other very large companies, or children there of like Dunn and Bradstreet, Cox Media, US Army.. etc..\n\nAfter I graduated from those awful \"Dilbert/Office Space\" like environments I started intentionally working for small start-up like companies in the Austin area as a software engineer/architect and enjoy it much more..\n\nI'm an avid programmer, coding all manner of rich web applications using languages, frameworks and protocols such as Ruby, Ruby on Rails, PHP, Zend, Doctrine, Javascript, Java, AJAX, JSON, XSLT, XML, XHTML DOM, ORM, CSS, and every other trendy acronym you care to throw in there.. When it comes to web development, I've done it - most of it professionally.\n\n##Hobbies\n\nMy hobbies include just about anything you can think of; I consider myself a very craftsy person and really enjoy making things. I make or have made armor (chain, leather, plate), bows & crossbow, clocks, and really enjoy turning wood as well as general wood working.\n\nI also enjoy reading and writing, though I will be the first to admit I'm not the greatest writer in the world.  I find that writing is actually quite difficult, and it only takes one gander at the blog here to realize my talents likely lie elsewhere..\n\nI am an avid game player and have plans in the works to create my very own ( who doesn't? ).  I enjoy MMO style games though I'm very tired of the current fantasy trend of games.  I would like some kind of futuristic space style game that doesn't punish me for playing.\n\nMusically, I have aspirations to play the piano and have even purchased a very nice keyboard with intent to play it one day, but just haven't managed to find the time.  I also am very keen to learn to play the chapman stick as it's got to be one of the coolest instruments on Arrakis, but I just haven't had time.\n\nI am interested in <a href=\"/tag/3d_graphics/\">3D graphics</a> and animation and consider myself a very good 3d modeler, though as with all things I could be better.\n\nI used to be an extreme paintball player and by extreme I mean I played a lot. I started playing in 1987 and continued to play it occasionally though I'm burned out on it now. I played semi-pro, doing the whole master circuit thing for a while to include being a head field ref for Zap Masters and Zap International Open, but in the end -- the game has gone a direction I just don't enjoy so I have mostly gotten out of it.  Though like I said, I do still go out occasionally with friends to play..\n\nOh and I <a href=\"/programming-and-me/\">program a bit</a> as well.  It's what I have done for a liveing for over 20 years.\n\n##US Army\n\nMy life to date has been a good one - I can't complain about anything. Right after high school my father got remarried, so I decided it was time for me to get out of the house so that he and his new wife could have a life together without me in the way..\n\nI decided to join the Army - or maybe it was decided for me .. not sure. I'm forced to thank my step brother for this one though as it was his idea (he made it sound so cool - he was doing it at the time), and it was a good idea at that, though the recruiter lied about pretty much everything.\n\nWhile the army in and of itself sucked, I met some of the best people in the world and am still friends with most of them. I got to do some very cool things while in the military and I got to go to some very.. interesting.. places.\n\nGlad it's over now. I tell people all the time, \"The Army's over all experience was excellent - the individual minutes sucked.\"  I'm sure this is true of all military branches.\n\nThings are always better when you look back at them. Sometimes I can't believe how long ago it was; It seems like only yesterday - boy how time flies. At this point I have been out of the army for three times the length of time I was in, and that just seems strange. Those days that took forever to go by, now seem very distant and that they went by in a flash.\n\nI was in the army for 5 years as a 98CKP, for those of you who have no idea what that is, I was a signals intelligence analyst and a Korean linguist - I make a mean cup of coffee for the golfs who are reading this. I'll also note that's an MOS that's no longer around so apparently we are a dying breed..\n\nThe job sounded cool! It wasn't. Actually it was damn boring - I ended up fixing trucks in the motor pool more than anything.\n\n##Palavista.com\n\nAfter I got out of the military I started my own business on the world wide web. (I have a long history of entrepreneurial endevours.) I created the very first digital music metacrawler that searched the internet for MP3s. It did very well and really got me back into programming after my military hiatus.\n\nAfter 2 years of development I ended up selling Palavista to a company in New York (ChangeMusic inc.) for $330k. And proceeded to retire for a couple years. It's a shame, they did nothing with it.  But then that's because about 2 weeks after I sold it, napster came out and it was all over for them.. I got out just in time..\n\n<a href=\"/images/2017/cop_pic.jpg\" class=\"fancybox pull-right\" title=\"Jason Ellis in uniform\"><img title=\"Jason Ellis in uniform\" src=\"/images/2017/cop_pic.jpg\" alt=\"Jason Ellis in uniform\" width=\"240\" /></a>\n\n\n##Law Enforcement\n\nAfter my early retirement back in 2001 (read: once I got bored) I decided to go into law enforcement. I worked for several years as a police officer in two different cities in central Texas.  I had some bad experiences with the departments I worked for and decided to get out of it.\n\nPart of me missed it because it had the camaraderie of the military and a very minor sense of celebrity in that it felt like you were doing something important.  I also never felt like I gave it a fair shake even though I did it for nearly 2 years.  I decided, it was time to give it a try again here in Georgia after \"the great software burnout of 2017\".  I'm still an officer today.\n\n---\n\nThat's me in a nut shell - of course there is a lot more to know but you'll have to read the rest of the site to get it. This site is as much a peripheral part of my brain as it is anything else. I write this stuff for my own pleasure, and not for you. If you find any enjoyment out of any of my ramblings then fantastic, but I did it for me.\n\nOne thing you may notice, I don't use spell checker, and I really should. Sorry about that - please forgive any typos.\n\nKeep in mind, this site is my very own oubliette of rambles, Rants! and stories. If you get offended by any of it, that's on you. You're in my sandbox now. In the end, my writing style is my own be it good, bad or ugly... I'm the one at the keyboard.\n","previous":null,"url":"/about/","relative_path":"_posts/1972-06-09-about.md","id":"/about","collection":"posts","excerpt":"I am a calm, considerate problem solver.
