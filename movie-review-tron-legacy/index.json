But once I did I was very excited!!  I think it looks great and it should be fairly easy to animate too..\n\nThe tread itself isn't finished, but since it's just 55ish clones of one tread anything I do to the parent magically appears on all the children.. Good times..\n\nIt's WAAAY too clean for a grot tank right now but I figured I'd make the clean version of everything then dirty it up my mangling the mesh and adding dirty textures..\n\nI had to ask via the Luxology forums how to group the instances correctly such that I could move them.  Otherwise they go all wonky when you click and drag..  But once done it made sense and I was ready to move on to the rest of the tank..\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2010/11/GrotTankDemo01.jpg\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Grot Tank\" src=\"/images/2010/11/GrotTankDemo01-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Grot Tank\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Grot Tank</span></a>\n\n+4 hours -- The next thing I did was build in the basic body shape..  I made sure to build subdivision into this model from the start so it wouldn't be something I would have to go back and do later..\n\nI also spent some time adjusting my environment so that my renders weren't straight up black and white..\n\nI have had a couple folks ask me recently if I thought Modo was worth the money..  For me I have to say yes.. Even though I don't do this professionally, It's just a hobby play thing I still think it was well worth the cost.  For professionals I'd say it's a must have..   Just the amount of work that one can do in a very short time is amazing..  It takes some training and experience, but still its fast going..\n\nAt this point I'm going to continue to work on the model, getting the \"clean\" tank finished before starting to add the bits of scrap metal, plating, rust and grime..etc..\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2010/11/TreadsDemo02.jpg\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"Exhaust\" src=\"/images/2010/11/TreadsDemo02-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Exhaust\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Exhaust</span></a>\n\n+2 hours -- So I spent a couple hours tonight beginning the exhaust system on the back of the tank.. Far from done of course, but looks good.. Again I went through and made sure that the mesh was 100% subdivision compliant and it looks good..\n\nIts far from finished though as I'm not sure what to put inside the cutouts.. This is one place where the model can't help me because its just solid..   I'll come up with something.. Likely something silly.. this is after all a grot tank..\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2010/11/Exhaust01.jpg\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Exhaust 2\" src=\"/images/2010/11/Exhaust01-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Exhaust 2\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Exhaust 2</span></a>\n\n+4 hours -- I spent the next four hours on this model getting the exhaust on the back of the tank looking the way I wanted it to look.   It's pretty close to the model I have and should look darn good once textures are applied.\n\nI probably went a bit overboard on the polycount but oh well that's something I always do anyway..   There is a piece still missing, and that's the little bar/strap that goes from the band around the middle to the tank body.   My practical model only has a stick of resin with no detail connecting the two, and that just wont do.. I'll figure out something.. I have some ideas already..\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2010/11/GrotTankDemo02.jpg\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"Grot Tank\" src=\"/images/2010/11/GrotTankDemo02-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Grot Tank\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Grot Tank</span></a>\n\n+2 hours -- I went through and added a bunch more greebles, nurnies and what's-it's around the tank.. You can't really tell in this image but there are a lot more.  Plus I started working on the tank body though most of the work is on the other side.. heh..\n\nI have a lot more work to do but the main portion will be taking the perfectly looking model and distorting it to make it look beat up and made up scrap metal parts..  Should be fun..\n\nI haven't started the turret yet as I want to get a good handle on the rest of the tank first and there is a lot left to do.. The turret would just get in the way and make me want to work on it..  It's the coolest part after all.. Saving the best for last!\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2010/11/GrotTankDemo03.jpg\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Metal Plating\" src=\"/images/2010/11/GrotTankDemo03-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Metal Plating\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Metal Plating</span></a>\n\n+4 hours -- I have been adding a lot of little deformed plates to the model as per my practical..  Basically they look like extra bits that have been bolted on, but all of them are beat up as befitting a true Grot vehicle..  Eventually I'll have to give the main tank body this same treatment..  But for now adding all the extra plating is taking time..  I'm not have way done with that..\n\nOnce I get the bulk of the plating done, I'll start working on deforming the tank body itself, before adding the rivets and holes etc..  Texturing the noise and destruction on to the model will really make the tank come to life eventually.  Should be good.\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2010/11/GrotTankDemo06.jpg\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"More Detail\" src=\"/images/2010/11/GrotTankDemo06-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"More Detail\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>More Detail</span></a>\n\n+ a bunch of hours -- I have been adding more plating, and generally cleaning up the model..\n\nThe main body is just about ready to start getting its deformation stuff before I get on to working on the turret.  At this point though I think I need to research a better way to make some of these details.. Right now I'm actually modeling everything in which is a huge time sink as well as making the model be an unbelievable number of polygons..\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2010/11/sheetmetal.jpg\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Sheet Metal\" src=\"/images/2010/11/sheetmetal-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Sheet Metal\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Sheet Metal</span></a>\n\nTake for example the sheet metal image to the right.. that's a lot of polygons for what amounts to a pretty small detail on the back of the model..   I'm sure I'll get some points for actually modeling it, but it puts a lot of strain on the renderer..  Right now I'm over 5 million polys and I'm no where near done..\n\nI think this is where the experts know super secret tricks and things that you can do to get that kind of detail without having to actually place pixels.. Bump, normal and parallax maps for example..  No idea how to use/create those though..\n","collection":"posts","url":"/40k-grot-tanks/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2010-11-30-game-review-perpetuum-online.md","collection":"posts","url":"/game-review-perpetuum-online/","path":"_posts/2010-11-30-game-review-perpetuum-online.md","id":"/game-review-perpetuum-online","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Game Review: Perpetuum Online","layout":"post","tags":["Perpetuum","Review"],"image":"/images/2010/11/shots-2010-06-0007.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":true,"allow_comments":false,"date":"2010-11-30 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"game-review-perpetuum-online","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2010-11-14-40k-grot-tanks.md","excerpt":"So for giggles I have been doing some Modo work this weekend.   Warhammer 40k Grot Tanks amuse me so I thought it would be fun to make one in 3D..","id":"/40k-grot-tanks","draft":false,"categories":["Hobbies"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"40k Grot Tanks","layout":"post","tags":["3D Graphics"],"image":"/images/2010/11/GrotTankDemo06.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2010-11-14 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"40k-grot-tanks","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2010-11-30-game-review-perpetuum-online.md","content":"<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2010/11/shots-2010-06-0007.jpg\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Perpetuum Online\" src=\"/images/2010/11/shots-2010-06-0007-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Perpetuum Online\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Perpetuum Online</span></a>\n\nA while back I was trolling the intertoobs for a new game when I stumbled across Perpetuum Online;  A Hungarian borne MMO based in the distant future on a far away planet where the avatars are Mech based as are the mobs with a large skill based PVE and PVP system..  Booya!  It sounded great!\n\nSo when it came out the other day, I was one of the first to sign up.  And I have to say I'm having a good time with it, but I'm getting ahead of myself..\n\nNow I want to give a fair description of the game, and I want to do my best to review it for its own merits, but its going to be really hard for me not to point out the similarities with Eve Online.\n\nThat is to say, its really similar in a lot of ways.. You could sum up a lot of the game by saying;  Eve Online has space ships..  Perpetuum Online has mechs..  And you'd get a pretty fair idea of how Perpetuum works.\n\n{% include ad.primary.html %}\n\nBut so far it doesn't have some of the issues Eve has..\n\nFirstly, the UI.   Eve Online has been notorious for having a dreadful user interface.  Everything is a right click and nesty in sub-menus which sucks, people have gone so far as to call it \"right click online\"..  They went more of a \"windows\" route in Perpetuum which I wholey support.  Each tool you open, opens in its own viewlet within the interface that you can move and customize as you see fit.  My only complaint is that they probably should have had a bunch of defaults for the windows when opened and they should better track previous locations when opened..etc..  As it stands now all newly opened windows tend to tile, or open center screen..  Minor complaints and things that will likely come out in the wash over time.\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2010/11/LearningCurve.jpg\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"Eve's Learning Curve\" src=\"/images/2010/11/LearningCurve-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Eve's Learning Curve\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Eve&#39;s Learning Curve</span></a>\n\nSecondly and quite possibly the most important difference is that they have simplified the game in some ways.  It doesn't seem to have that death steep learning curve that Eve Online has..  Plus, Perpetuum has a fairly robust help system and the help channel is actually helpful as opposed to constant spam and nonstop egregious asshatery that you often find in the Eve help channel.\n\nI also really like the fact that they are paying more attention to the PVE aspect of the game.  Eve online had some meager PVE grafted on but it was horrible, boring and kinda pointless.  You could grind faction in Eve but it really served little to no purpose..  In Perpetuum there is a much larger PVE element to the game, and faction means something.  I hope they go so far as to add PVE bosses ala some of the fantasy games out there.  I like that there is PVP, but all PVP all the time is made of fail.\n\nSomething else that appeals to me is that this game is being developed by a very small group of folks by an independant developer and I want them to succeed.  The dev team is a group of like 5 guys in their garage.. Okay it may be a few more and they probably aren't stuck in a garage, but you get the idea.. Something appeals to me about a small independent team as opposed to a huge corporate group with $$$$ as their only goal.. (that's not to say that a small group isn't also concerned about profits, but they usually are more open to game changing things..)\n\nThere are a lot of things that still need to be done and the devs are fully aware of that.  But it's a damn good start..\n\nI really like that I am coming to in fresh from the very beginning and can expand as the game expands.  I wonder what the game will be like in a year when new players show up and everyone else out classes the new player 10 fold.\n\nIn Eve that was a bit of a problem, but was solved by making small new player ships still somewhat competitive against the bigger ships so you could still play and not be completely out matched.   Since there are nothing but small ships in Perpetuum as of yet, I am hoping they took this approach too.  It would be bad if after a year new players show up and just repreatedly trounced..  There is no velocity or angle of attack defenses in Perpetuum, so a small bot can't \"speed tank\" a big one.. Not sure how they will handle that..\n\nAlso right now the economy is completely broken.. Prices are out of whack and I'm making money faster than should be possible, but thats because I'm exploiting the market while it stabilizes..   This same thing happened at the beginning of Eve..  But as an old Eve player I understand how the market works and can make the best of it.. heh.. yay me..\n\nAll in all its a good game.. its fun.. it's an open world sandbox that allows you to do whatever you want ala' Eve Online, but with mechs..  How cool is that?\n","collection":"posts","url":"/game-review-perpetuum-online/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2010-11-30-game-review-perpetuum-online.md","collection":"posts","url":"/game-review-perpetuum-online/","path":"_posts/2010-11-30-game-review-perpetuum-online.md","id":"/game-review-perpetuum-online","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Game Review: Perpetuum Online","layout":"post","tags":["Perpetuum","Review"],"image":"/images/2010/11/shots-2010-06-0007.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":true,"allow_comments":false,"date":"2010-11-30 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"game-review-perpetuum-online","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2010-12-17-movie-review-tron-legacy.md","content":"<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2010/12/Tron-Legacy-Poster.jpg\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Tron Legacy Poster\" src=\"/images/2010/12/Tron-Legacy-Poster-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Tron Legacy Poster\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Tron Legacy Poster</span></a>\n\n*Note: Spoilers will be announced below.  The first couple of paragraphs are spoiler free.*\n\nEasily one of my favorite movies as a kid, Tron was a movie that not only defined a generation but also began the monumental shift in the movie industry towards using computers as a tool.    Without Tron leading the way showing what could be done, many of the movies today would have never been made.\n\nI loved the first Tron for it's fantastical notion that computers were alive and that programs were people too..  It was great if a little heavy handed, thin in the plot department and some pretty obvious technological issues..etc..  However, even with all the originals shortcomings, I was pretty sure back then even that we'd see a sequel to the movie in short order cause it was awesome..\n\nSet the way forward machine to 28 fricken years and finally we have something to talk about!    I had all but forgotten about Tron to be honest until 2008 or so when I saw that first comic-con shakey cellphone cam footage of the new TR2N trailer at which point I had a tron-gasm..  Then I really thought about it and I was kinda pissed it took this long to come out with a sequel, but then once I realized what they were doing there was a pretty glaring obvious reason why it took that long..\n\nSo without spoiling anything yet, I will say that the new movie is probably an 8.5 out of 10.  The visual effects were excellent, the costumes were okay, the acting was good, the plot was still pretty thin though and that might be it's downfall..  All in all I thought it was good and about as much as they could have done with the film.   It was an entertaining movie, and well worth the viewing.\n\nSo now on to the spoilers.  You may want to look away if you haven't seen it yet.\n\nSo first I'm going to talk about all those things I didn't like - it's my show I can do it in my order;\n\nThe biggest thing they were showcasing and the likely reason it took 28 years to make a second film was of course; Clu.  Making Jeff Bridges young again in order to play his programmatical counterpart was no mean feat.  In fact I'm sure it took tens of thousands of hours to put that character together and get it fully realized.   But, it looked wrong to me.   I understand why they did it and I agree that it had to be done in order to tell this story but I just didn't buy it.   He looked wrong.\n\nSee the issue is that we know what people look like and how they should move.  It's one of the reasons that Jurassic Park lasts the test of time; there are no CG people.  The dinosaurs look perfect to us even to this day because we have no real concept of how those critters should move or look.  So that 18 year old technology still works.\n\nClu was a CG copy of Mr. Bridges and to me it stood out that he was CG.   This was really jarring for me.  In a couple of the scenes were Clu was emotional and moved his face muscles he looked way more realistic to me..\n\nThis honestly was my biggest gripe about the whole movie.  It's the thing they focused on the most, and I just don't think they got it.   I don't want to belittle the effort though because it's SO FRICKEN CLOSE.. I mean they are 95% there.. but something is missing and I can't quite put my finger on it other than to say, his eyes and face didn't move correctly.  They seemed really dead and motionless.\n\nSo the next thing was that after they did all that work on making Clu, they did ZERO work on Tron himself.  You learn who Clu's henchman is pretty quickly, it's almost obvious.. Yet he wears his motorcycle helmet the whole movie so they don't have to do his face like they did Clu's .. and as much as I just bitched that they failed at making Clu's I'm offended they didn't make Trons.\n\nSeriously it seems such a cop-out to me that Mr. Boxleitner didn't get the same facial treatment..  One might say it's because it would have taken focus away from the Flynn/Clu/Sam story.. but I dunno, give us some credit..\n\nThe next thing was the complete lack of a transition.  Again I felt this was a tad jarring, and I'm not sure if it's because I expected it or if they were assuming you had seen the first movie and didn't need to waste time and money on it or what..   But in the first movie there was a point after Flynn hit \"enter\" on the keyboard that they laser lit up and began to disassemble him..   He then traveled down the fuzz filled pipe into the computer..  It was a build up, a suspenseful transition from the real to the computerized..    Not so much here..  It seemed like  just a reel change here.. Blip! you're inside .. Go!  I was disappointed by that..\n\nAnd lastly, the plot.  Thiiin.. Like anorexic thin..  In fact much of the plot seemed to be loosely tied thread that they used to drag you from one exciting graphic packed scene to the next..  The funny thing is, it might be enough..  I dunno, we shall see..\n\nBut really, that's it.. those are the few things that really disappointed me.. And honestly those are minor..

They used to be \"the\" game genre, but over the years as time and technology has marched forward they have largely started to decline in  favor of more real time strategy games and first person shooters.\n\nSo when <a href=\"http://www.wgames.biz/\" target=\"_blank\">W!Games</a> introduced Greed Corp a modern turn based strategy game with a very clever land collapsing mechanic to the PC late last year, I was pretty excited..  This was the first I had heard of it even though the  PS3 and XBox players had access to it since last February.  I don't follow the console games market at all so it was completely new to me.\n\nI have to admit I really like it.. The best part about this game is that it's actually a game.. Meaning it focuses on game play not wizbang special effects or graphics..  I really feel that this is a shining example of good game design and salute the W!Games folks.\n\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2011/01/Greed-Corp-screen.jpg\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"Greed Corp screen\" src=\"/images/2011/01/Greed-Corp-screen-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Greed Corp screen\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Greed Corp screen</span></a>\n\nThe fun of the game comes in the form of playing on the edge of a very delicate balancing act between harvesting resources to fuel your expansion and preserving that land to stay alive.   The games landmass is divided up into these hex tiles that you take control of in an attempt to control the whole map.  Each hex tile has a level associated with it and each time your harvester harvests it's tile and the six around it, that level is lowered one.\n\nIf you lower it too far, it breaks up and falls away.  You can (and often do) intentionally crack up some key spots to  help direct the flow or to cause a cascade of tile collapses in order to win the game..  It's a lot of fun and can be deceptively challenging..\n\nIt's not your standard 4X (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate) game like Masters of Orion or Civilization..   In that there is no exploration, you see the entire map from get go and know exactly what your opponents are doing all the time.   Nor does it have that rock/paper/scissors mechanic in it's pieces where each piece has an advantage over some other piece, but a weakness to a third as so many modern games try to do..\n\nTo me this is one of those \"chess\" games..  You have a one primary game piece that has a very specific movement rule-set.  And you have a 3 possible placeable pieces (buildings) with no movement mechanic but affect the map or gameplay in some way.  That's it.  Simple.  Elegant.\n\nThe rest of it is about playing your opponent by out maneuvering them with your few pieces..  It's brilliant..\n\nI give this game 4.5 out of 5.  The only reason it's not a 5 is because the of the camera angle and zoom level.  I can't help but feel the camera angle is too steep, and pine for the ability to zoom out a bit..  But other than that I can honestly say well done guys.. Great stuff.\n","collection":"posts","url":"/game-review-greed-corp/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2011-01-15-game-review-greed-corp.md","collection":"posts","url":"/game-review-greed-corp/","path":"_posts/2011-01-15-game-review-greed-corp.md","id":"/game-review-greed-corp","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Game Review: Greed Corp","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2011/01/Greed-Corp-screen.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2011-01-15 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"game-review-greed-corp","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2011-02-09-15-mac-book-pro.md","content":"<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2011/01/apple_mbp_core_i5_8.jpg\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Mac Book Pro 15&quot;\" src=\"/images/2011/01/apple_mbp_core_i5_8-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Mac Book Pro 15&quot;\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Mac Book Pro 15&quot;</span></a>\n\nI have been in the market for a new laptop for a while.  The primary machine I had was a Lenovo w500 and before that a Lenovo t42p..  But both of those machines were property of IBM..  I didn't own them, and I had to keep IBM software installed, as well as generally not use the machine for personal stuff..  It was time for a new machine.\n\nNow I will say that the Lenovo machines were okay.  Not horrible.  But I did have a lot of issues with them, and the t42p just up and died one day.  It was only 3 years old when it died which I felt was an extremely short lifespan for a laptop.\n\nI have a Sony Vaio that I got in 1999 that still works, it's just really old at this point.  But that's the kind of life time I expect of a piece of hardware like these. The only issue with the Sony is it's age and it has a really small screen.. But still!  These are expensive machines and they should last.  It was completely unacceptable to me that the Lenovo's didn't even come close.  And most people I have talked to who had Lenovo's of their own had a similar experience.\n\n{% include ad.primary.html %}\n\nSo, I splurged and purchased a 15\" Mac Book Pro.  This is a really nice piece of hardware.. I'm quite excited about it..  Everyone that I know that has a mac book is happy with it and they all say that hardware wise it's easily the best laptop you can buy.. I have to agree.. It's a rock solid laptop..\n\nI went through and got all the software on it that I wanted and got my LAMP setup working so I can do some development on there..etc..  Good stuff..\n","collection":"posts","url":"/15-mac-book-pro/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2011-02-21-game-review-world-of-tanks-beta.md","collection":"posts","url":"/game-review-world-of-tanks-beta/","path":"_posts/2011-02-21-game-review-world-of-tanks-beta.md","id":"/game-review-world-of-tanks-beta","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Game Review: World of Tanks (Beta)","layout":"post","tags":["Review","World of Tanks"],"image":"/images/2011/02/tiger_ii_1024_768.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":true,"allow_comments":false,"date":"2011-02-21 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"game-review-world-of-tanks-beta","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2011-02-09-15-mac-book-pro.md","excerpt":"I have been in the market for a new laptop for a while.  The primary machine I had was a Lenovo w500 and before that a Lenovo t42p..  But both of those machines were property of IBM, and to be honest.. crap..","id":"/15-mac-book-pro","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"15\" Mac Book Pro!","layout":"post","tags":["Apple"],"image":"/images/2011/01/apple_mbp_core_i5_8.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2011-02-09 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"15-mac-book-pro","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2011-01-15-game-review-greed-corp.md","excerpt":"I have always liked turn based strategy games..
