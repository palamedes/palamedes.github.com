But man its worth it..  This guy is great as is the product he puts out..  I listen to one of his episodes (randomly) every day just to get into the groove and help me focus on my work..

Instead of pushing a single button, maybe sense that we are actually pushing a cord or even a single string..   And once you get to the end of the difficulty curve you're playing the song..   How awesome would that be?!\n\nSuddenly not only would Rock Band be a kick ass game, but it would also be a must have teacher that could train you to play your favorite songs (for only $2 a download.. or whatever it is..)..\n\nOnce you have a device that hooks into a guitar or drums it should be fairly simple to make that device work for other instruments..\n\nImagine if you will, \"Piano Hero!\"  or maybe \"Violin Hero!\"   It would allow you to play a game with you instrument of choice, and go a long way towards teaching you to better play that instrument..\n\nYou think \"Band Hero\" is fun?  Try \"Symphony Hero!\" hah\n\nThere are so many possibilities here.. I seriously hope that they don't squander this..  They could spark a whole new revolution around music making if they really wanted to..\n","collection":"posts","url":"/rock-band-to-real-band/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2010-04-09-rock-band-to-real-band.md","collection":"posts","url":"/rock-band-to-real-band/","path":"_posts/2010-04-09-rock-band-to-real-band.md","id":"/rock-band-to-real-band","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"From Rock Band to Real Band","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2010/04/rock-band-guitar-decal-150x150.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2010-04-09 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"rock-band-to-real-band","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2010-04-19-hardware-review-nook-e-reader.md","content":"<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2010/04/nook_angle-view.jpg\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"BN.com Nook\" src=\"/images/2010/04/nook_angle-view-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"BN.com Nook\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>BN.com Nook</span></a>\n\nSo I have been in the market for an e-reader for a while.  I do a lot of reading and thought it would be darn handy to have a single device that could carry multiple books, and have the ability to order new books at any time, anywhere.  I like real paper books, but the ability to carry many books in one small device is appealing.  And despite what my sister in law says, I think they are generally a good idea and can only encourage reading..\n\nEveryone I know swears by the Amazon Kindle, and while the device works just fine I just didn't much like it.  I got my paws on a friends and it felt cheap to me, plus I really didn't like that keyboard down there..

I have two 40k armies; Tau and Orks.  I like them both and am not really looking to change them..   But right now I only really have one fantasy army;  Skaven.  I love my rats, but I want to find another army to play and have been looking for a while..  I tried Ogre's and I tried Tomb Kings but really didn't get into them.  I have a lot of TK stuff painted up and I very much like the models and the lore, but for whatever reason the TK army just doesn't excite me..  The Ogre's never even got that far..\n\nSo I'm back on the hunt and I think I have settled on getting a Daemons of Chaos list going.\n\nI think all of the models are pretty neat, and I like that that its sorta 4 armies in one; one list for each god.  Something that also appeals on a lesser level is the fact that they are the exact same models used in Fantasy and 40k.. So if you have them ready to go in Fantasy, its easy to use them in 40k.  (Just have to solve the bases problem which I'll get to in a moment.. )\n\nMy number one reason for picking this army is because I dig the models.  I am most likely going to go an all Slaanesh army, or if that's not viable I'll fill in with Nurgle or Khorne..   I'm going to leave Tzeentch out because it seems it's what ever one is doing and I like doing things others aren't..\n\nI really look forward to painting these guys (gals?) up.. I think the Slaanesh models all look pretty cool and should be quite fun to paint.. I know I wont get anywhere near as good results as the professional painters do, but still they look good and should come out okay..\n\nThe only issue at this point is that the new core rule book is coming out in July and is rumored to nurf the Daemons down something harsh..  If the current rumors hold true then the DoC army as a whole may be unplayable.. I find that unfortunate, but not enough to dissuade me from getting the army in the first place..\n\nI have also heard tell that half the reason for the new rule book is to correct issues in the DoC army and a couple other newer armies that introduced issues into the game.. It's really too bad they feel the need to completely rewrite the main rules, instead of just fixing the issue with the individual army..\n\n<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2010/04/daemonette.jpg\" class='pull-left fancybox'><img title=\"daemonette\" src=\"/images/2010/04/daemonette-e1272512468652-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Fantasy and 40k approved!</span></a>\n\n__The Bases__:  So, I listed above that these models can be used in both fantasy and 40k.. that's pretty cool.. The only issue is that fantasy uses square bases, and 40k uses round bases.  That issue can be complicated further by the fact that 40k bases are one inch in diameter, and fantasy bases are typically 20mm or 25mm square..  So, if you want to use the same models in both games (as opposed to buying the same models twice.. ) then you have to get clever about your bases..\n\nI solved it this way;\n\n1.  I got some washers that are smaller around than both the 40k bases and the fantasy bases you're going to use.  With the Daemonettes I was in luck, they use  25mm bases so I could get a slightly larger washer than if I was stuck with 20mm bases.  Also make sure the washers have as small a center hole as possible.  The washers I'm using are 7/8 (0.87\") with a 7/32 (0.20\") inner hole, got them at Lowes for $3 or $4 for a hand full..\n\n2. I then assembled the model as I wanted it and glued it to the top of one of the washers -- trying very hard not to foul the hole in the washer.\n\n3. I then drilled 4 itty bitty holes in the base and stuck in some of the tiny magnets I have.   I mean it these things are small.. 0.05\" is small man..  4 of them hold the washer down nicely, and are small enough to not cause clustering.. (Where a bunch of magnets jump to one another.. )  Drill all the way through the base with a drill bit slightly smaller than the magnet, and then enlarge it a bit by in and out movements..  This is a tiny hobby drill bit.. Once that's done, I glued the magnets in from the underside so they wont go anywhere.\n\n4. I then got a dowel from Walmarts hobby area that was the exact fit for the washers..  You can get a bag of like 20 of them for $0.89..   I drilled a whole in the direct center of the base and pushed the dowel through.. I had to be very careful not to split the base.. And I made sure to push the down through the hole a bit so that it touches the table the same time the edges of the base does.  It helps with gluing later.\n\n5.  I then took the thinnest washer I had ( they are varying thicknesses for some odd reason ) and slid it down the dowel until to stuck to the magnets..  Put the dowel in a vice, and used a coping saw to cut the dowel at the washer.  Once that was done I applied glue to the underside, again ensuring that nothing goes anywhere.\n\n6.  And that's it..  Paint and flock it up.. When you flock the square base you want to make sure that you use an extra washer because it gets kinda nasty.. And when it dries you might have to do some minor surgery to get that washer off.. I had to carefully Xacto around the edges to free it from its flocky jail..\n\nClick the image to see the results.. it works out nicely..  The 40k round bases snaps up in there and only requires a touch of flocking on the top of the dowel.. the fantasy base you see snaps down nicely too almost 100% hiding the washer..\n","collection":"posts","url":"/daemons-of-chaos/","output":null,"next":{"previous":{"relative_path":"_posts/2010-04-27-daemons-of-chaos.md","collection":"posts","url":"/daemons-of-chaos/","path":"_posts/2010-04-27-daemons-of-chaos.md","id":"/daemons-of-chaos","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Games Workshop -- Warhammer: Daemons of Chaos","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2010/04/kos-150x150.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":true,"allow_comments":false,"date":"2010-04-27 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"daemons-of-chaos","ext":".md"},"relative_path":"_posts/2010-04-30-tron-2-lightcycle.md","content":"<a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/images/2010/04/troncycle01.jpg\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Tron Lightcycle\" src=\"/images/2010/04/troncycle01-e1272648379482-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Tron Lightcycle\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /><br /><span>Tron Lightcycle</span></a>\n\nI want one..\n\nSo I have gone above and beyond out of my way to avoid learning any details about Tron 2..

The dodge just looks like raw power, and as such dangerous.. I'm pretty sure the lightcycle looks cooler to me because its tapping directly into my childhood fantasies..  I loved Tron as a kid.  I loved the universe, I loved the movie, I loved the games.. and I loved Cindy Morgan but that's another story.. Most of all I just liked the concepts, core of which was the whole lightcycle fight..   The lightcycles really made the universe feel real..  And to this day I have to wonder how many people ride around on their \"crotch-rocket\" with the Tron theme running through their head..\n\nWell apparently, the lightcycles in the new movie are real working motorcycles.. (or so is the rumor.. )  That appeals to every childhood fantasy I ever had regarding the Tron lore.. I so want one!  I'm pretty sure everyone else wants one too..  I am willing to bet if they sold them, they would go like hotcakes..  I'd get one if I could..   Dream on...\n","collection":"posts","url":"/tron-2-lightcycle/","output":null,"next":{"relative_path":"_posts/2010-05-01-game-review-splintercell-conviction.md","collection":"posts","url":"/game-review-splintercell-conviction/","path":"_posts/2010-05-01-game-review-splintercell-conviction.md","id":"/game-review-splintercell-conviction","draft":false,"categories":["Games"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Game Review: Splintercell Conviction","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2010/05/tom_clancys_splinter_cell_conviction-4.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":true,"allow_comments":false,"date":"2010-05-01 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"game-review-splintercell-conviction","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2010-04-30-tron-2-lightcycle.md","excerpt":"I want one..
