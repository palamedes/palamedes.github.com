I sort of waffled back and forth as to whether or not to get the iPhone or the N95..  The decision was very much made for me when they announced the SDK for the iPhone back in January of 2008, and I got one a day or two later..  I found out that the <a href=\"/iphone-its-not-all-hype/\" target=\"_self\">iPhone wasn't all hype</a> and that I seriously made the right choice.. The N95 is a good device but now that I have handled both, I can say that the iPhone was superior in the one way that mattered the most;  the interface.\n\nI continue to use just about all of the features of my iPhone on a daily basis and can honestly say it's one of the most useful tools I have ever owned..  I have loved this device.. When the <a href=\"/3g-iphone/\" target=\"_self\">3G iPhone</a> came out I briefly had some unfaithful thoughts and considered upgrading but to be honest I just didn't feel the improvements were enough to warrant the cost even though it was only $200..  I passed..   Then the 3Gs came out and again, I didn't see the advantage.. Sure a few extra go faster stripes, but just not that big of an improvement..  Pass again..\n\nWith each iteration of the OS, they continue to upgrade the first generation device in lock step with the later generations which I felt was a really good thing to do.  I personally believe that you should never, ever cripple your hardware through software.   If a device can do a thing, it should be allowed to do a thing..  And it appeared they weren't crippling their older device just so you would upgrade... Until it became apparent that they were doing just that..\n\nThe irony of course is that Apple is sort of known for doing exactly that and yet I still bought in..   The iPhone has been wonderful and will likely continue to be wonderful as a device, but the more I use it and the deeper I get into the user experience as well as the developers experience the more I realize that there are a lot of limitations in place.  Some of those were put there by Apple intentionally to get you to upgrade to the latest revision of the hardware..  And that's shitty..\n\nI recently purchased a very nice <a href=\"/hardware-review-sony-dr-bt21g-wireless-bluetooth-stereo-headset/\" target=\"_self\">bluetooth stereo headset</a> with the intention of using them with my phone..  However Apple has disabled the A2DP bluetooth profile on the first generation iPhone..  Just 'cause..   The phone certainly can do it, it's a software profile not a hardware difference but they decided do turn that feature off.   They also didn't enable MMS for the first generation iPhone even though I'm pretty sure we were promised that along with everyone else.. again that simply sucks..  Don't even get me started on the \"new\" voice activation shit the new 3Gs can do and that my p910a could do 5 years ago..   I can say that this sort of thing has made me pretty angry at Apple..\n\nI am also somewhat annoyed with AT&amp;T of late as their network is completely and totally hozed.  A buddy of mine that works for AT&amp;T said their network in the Austin area is something like 400% saturated and yet are forced (by the consumer) to continue to add new features like the recently added MMS stuff..  3G is great if the network actually has bandwidth..  When my phone first came out the Edge network (2G) worked fine.. sure it was a tad slow but it worked... NOW it doesn't work at all because they have throttled it down to nothing trying to eek out more 3G bandwidth to support the customer demand..   So while previously my wife with her 3G iPhone would load a webpage in 30 seconds that would take me a minute to load, now her phone can sometimes load it in a minute and mine times out every time.. So effectively my iPhone's network is gone.. (Depends largely on the time of day.. )\n\nI had told my wife that I was going to get the next version of the iPhone.. whatever came after the 3Gs.. I told her that the 3Gs was tempting but wasn't quite better enough to warrant the cost and that I normally hang on to a device for 2 or so years before upgrading anyway..  So whatever Apple came out with next would do me..  I assumed at the time I said this that Apple would continue to actually support my device in the form of upgrades..  Now I'm less sure of this..\n\nIn my mind they have intentionally crippled the first generation iPhone such that I can't use stereo bluetooth, MMS or the new Voice activation stuff even though the hardware supports it..   And that's shitty..  And all so I would rush out and purchase the latest hardware..  (Which I couldn't do anyway in the case of the 3G because I was contractually obligated to AT&amp;T..)\n\nSo.. Now I'm forced to consider alternatives..  Or rather not forced, but am shopping for alternatives because Apple &amp; AT&amp;T has pissed me off..  Their business tactics smack of greed and I just don't like that..\n\nAnd while my iPhone still very much works and for the most part still does everything I need, I would like to get a new phone simply for the newer abilities that are out there..   The problem was the iPhone (even the original one) set the bar extremely high..  The interface just wins.. The application store system works very nicely and is a huge win for both developers and customers alike..  The native applications all work extremely well, are user friendly and functional.. etc.. it's gonna be tough finding something that works as well and has the features and functionality of even my crippled phone..\n\n<img class=\"pull-right\" title=\"SEXperia\" src=\"/images/2009/11/SEXperia.jpg\" alt=\"SEXperia\" width=\"189\" height=\"348\" />Or so I thought..  I had looked into quite a few different devices, most of them were either the latest Symbian or Android style phones.. None of them really did what I wanted.. the form factor was just all wrong in most cases..  They had unnecessary things like slider keyboards or just uncomfortable shapes, or they weren't enough of a convergence device..\n\nThen a co-worker pointed out the <a href=\"http://www.sonyericsson.com/cws/products/mobilephones/overview/xperiax10a?lc=en&amp;cc=us\" target=\"_blank\">Xperia X10 by Sony Ericsson</a>.   Wow..  It's not out yet, but the <a href=\"http://www.sonyericsson.com/cws/products/mobilephones/specifications/xperiax10a?lc=en&amp;cc=us\" target=\"_blank\">specs are available online</a> and I must say I'm impressed..  I have a fairly high opinion of the SE line of devices.. The p910a was a great device for its day.. I really had zero complaints about it and think back on it fondly..\n\nIn my opinion, the quality of the iPhone where the physical device is concerned is pretty high.. It doesn't feel flimsy for easily breakable even though the whole front of it is glass.. It has a nice weight to it and it's comfortable to hold..  The only thing I don't like physically about the iPhone is the volume is really low by comparison to some of my other phones (the Nokia Communicator I owned was so loud I had to hold it away from my head..)\n\nI'm seriously hoping that the the Xperia phone matches the iPhone for physical quality..  If it does then it's a shoe in for my next device..  ALL of the spec's for this device beat my first generation iPhone by a landslide..  Plus it appears to have the same touch screen style interface and it's an \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_%28operating_system%29\" target=\"_blank\">Android</a>\" with 1ghz processor?!   Christ it's a phone that's more powerful than my first two IBM PCs combined..\n\nThe biggest complaint most folks have is that it doesn't have a keyboard..  Are you fucking kidding me?  I just don't understand that..  I used to think a keyboard would be nice until I had a device that had one and never used it..  Once I got used to the iPhone style of on screen keyboard I was done with physical keys..  Touch screen is where it's at folks..  Real keyboards in a device this size are simply not practical nor are they useful...\n\nThe real big complaint is that this phone will likely cost around $800... or more...\n\nEither way I think this phone is it.. It's still a ways out yet though.. it's slated to be released in \"the first half of 2010\" which knowing SE will be the very last day of that time frame or pushed back later.. heh\n\nI'm also not entirely sure about the UI code named \"Rachel\" by Sony Ericsson..\n\n*link removed*\n\nLooks good to me!  It's getting bashed by a lot of folks for some reason though.. I think it's very pretty and seems fully functional.. *shrug*  I dunno why people hate it so much.. I guess change is scary.. They may just want the row after row of icons and nothing else..\n\nThe other complaint is that it's being shipped with android 1.6 instead of 2.0 which people can't understand.. I think that decision has a lot to do with the development cycle.. The phone has likely been in development for a while now and its currently written on 1.6.. When does 2.0 come out?   They would have to completely rewrite to get 2.0 crammed in there at the last second before the phone was due to be released..  I think by writing it on 1.6 they get the software down pat and can then release the 2.0 version in a upgrade down the road..   Quality folks.. they want the OS to work the first time around..\n\nI can appreciate that..  I'd take a stable 1.6 over a buggy 2.0 package anyday..\n\nAnyway.. that's it.. This thing looks hot.. Here is another video of the music player and photo viewer.. Looks great..\n\n*link removed*\n\nI'll keep you posted.\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2009-11-02-hardware-review-sony-dr-bt21g-wireless-bluetooth-stereo-headset.md","url":"/hardware-review-sony-dr-bt21g-wireless-bluetooth-stereo-headset/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-11-02-hardware-review-sony-dr-bt21g-wireless-bluetooth-stereo-headset.md","id":"/hardware-review-sony-dr-bt21g-wireless-bluetooth-stereo-headset","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Hardware Review:  Sony DR-BT21G Wireless Bluetooth Stereo Headset","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2009/11/headphones.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-11-02 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"hardware-review-sony-dr-bt21g-wireless-bluetooth-stereo-headset","ext":".md"},"url":"/xperia-x10-my-next-phone/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-11-07-xperia-x10-my-next-phone.md","id":"/xperia-x10-my-next-phone","collection":"posts","excerpt":"On June 27th, 2007 (shortly after I got married) the iPhone came out..

I mean you either get mono with mic or stereo, but no stereo with mic?!\n\nThen it occurred to me that the only time I would use the mic would be with my phone (more on that in a second) or when talking in Vent. or Teamspeak... neither of which would use stereo anyway..  So stereo headphones AND a mic would be pointless..\n\nThe battery life seems good too.. The box says it's rated for 11 hours of either headphone or headset(+mic) use and 100 hours of standby time..  I can't talk to the standby time as I tend to charge things pretty often, but I believe the 11 hours of headphone time..  I have yet to actually run out of juice while using them so.. *shrug*\n\nAll in all I like them.. I think they were a good purchase and I would recommend them.. They are light and comfortable and fold up nicely when you want to store them..\n\nPairing is simple and works well, though I had an odd issue the first time I paired with my Mac.. For whatever reason I had to reboot my mac to get anything to work post pairing.. I think that was more due to the fact that my mac hadn't been rebooted in like 4 months hehe.. It was starting to act wonky and I have all manner of stuff running on there so this was likely me, not the headphones..   Also it appears that \"Teamspeex\" doesn't fully support these, though Ventrilo and everything else works perfectly.\n\nMy only real complaint about them is that they must have a wall charger instead of just a USB charger..  This is a really.. really minor complaint and I hesitate to even mention it..  I just thought it was odd that it had a wall charger instead of a computer one.. but it occurs that a lot of folks may never actually use this device with a PC, but rather entirely with a IPod like device or their phone..  At which point they are still near a computer..  *shrug* still its minor..\n\nThe other complaint I have has nothing to do with this device, but rather my iPhone.   I have the first generation iPhone and it can't suppport the A2DP connection required to listen to music.. Which pisses me off..   Not because it can't do it, but because it totally can do it and Apple has it turned off for the original phones in order to get you to upgrade to the newer iPhones.. (If you have a 3G or 3Gs it works fine)\n\nGood job Sony..\n","previous":{"next":{"path":"_posts/2009-11-02-hardware-review-sony-dr-bt21g-wireless-bluetooth-stereo-headset.md","url":"/hardware-review-sony-dr-bt21g-wireless-bluetooth-stereo-headset/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-11-02-hardware-review-sony-dr-bt21g-wireless-bluetooth-stereo-headset.md","id":"/hardware-review-sony-dr-bt21g-wireless-bluetooth-stereo-headset","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Hardware Review:  Sony DR-BT21G Wireless Bluetooth Stereo Headset","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2009/11/headphones.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-11-02 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"hardware-review-sony-dr-bt21g-wireless-bluetooth-stereo-headset","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2009-11-01-happy-halloween-2009.md","output":null,"content":"<a href=\"/images/2009/11/littleredridinghoodpluswolf.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" class='pull-right fancybox'><img title=\"Halloween Costumes\" src=\"/images/2009/11/littleredridinghoodpluswolf-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Halloween Costumes\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>\n\nThe annual Halloween bash that my friend and his wife put on was a success!   Every year my friend Calvin and his wife go NUTS with Halloween..  They dress the house up, have hordes of food for guests, skads of candy for the kids and even have smoke machines strategically placed to set the atmosphere..    I have to admit, I'm liking it..\n\nI was never a big fan of Halloween as a kid though..

Everything else worked, but slowly over the course of a couple days the optics got less and less responsive and then finally stopped all together..   I had put the mouse in the closet on the shelf which is generally where hardware goes to die at my house..  Today I went in there to do some cleaning and putter around only to find that the mouse battery cover had been forced off by a battery that had swelled to more than double its original size!!*\n\n*My opinion on this thing is back to \"avoid at all costs\"..  The level of support being what it was and the number of other folks who have similar issues tells me that this thing sucks bad.  Add to that the random deaths, the number of folks who have similar optical issues, the battery swelling issue, the very short battery life and it's inability to work on some surfaces... yeah.. don't buy this mouse.*\n\n*Update (Nov 1, 2009) :: After all is said and done, I have the mouse back from Razer and it is working as I think it should.   It doesn't do the sleep-death thing it was doing previously which implies to me that the old firmware was horribly buggy and the newer firmware is required for sure..  That was the number one issue previously and it appears to be resolved..   The Razer management team that I dealt with were nothing but professional and courteous though I am still concerned about the \"standard\" support they are providing as those folks didn't give anywhere near the level of support that I got directly from the president and his main man (of course)..  My over all opinion on the device itself has gone from \"avoid at all costs\" to, \"okay its not bad so long as you get the most recent version\".  I still find myself occasionally using the G7 which I still find telling but I am not sworn off Razer products as I was previously..  And no they didn't pay me or make me say these things.. *\n\n*Now on to the original post ::  I was pretty frustrated and angry when I initially wrote this.  The tone is a lot harsher than it should be and for that I apologize, but the message is still basically what I want it to be.. *\n\nAs I have said previously, I'm a pretty hard core Logitech fan.  I use a lot of their hardware, and am always very happy with it..  I have used several Logitech mice in my day (corded and cordless) and up until fairly recently was using a Logitech G7.   The G7 is one of their cordless gaming mice and I have used it for a while.   I really like it, it's a wonderful mouse and I highly recommend it.  My only complaint being that I wish it had 2 thumb buttons instead of one.. that was it.. my only complaint..  I managed to break the mouse wheel on mine though due to my own stupidity and being a bit rough with it, so it was time to replace it..\n\nA buddy of mine has a Razer mouse and loves it, so when I was at the store and saw the Ferrari of the Razer mouse line; the Mamba wireless gaming mouse -- I went ahead and picked it up..\n\nAt $129.99 I expected this thing to perform like no other..  In fact, at twice the cost of my Logitech G7, I expected it to perform twice as well..  It came in a really nice box, with a lot of high and mighty claims on the box so I was thinking I had a winner..\n\nLet me be clear here -- this mouse is the biggest piece of shit, I have ever.. and I mean.. EVER used..\n\nI have been struggling and fighting with it for a while now, it's beyond the time for me to take it back or I would.   I'm going to compare it to the Logitech G7, which I now know to be a superior mouse in every way except possibly the three listed below which has nothing to do with how I use the mouse;\n\n* __Packaging:__ The Razer folks took some queues from Apple on this one, the unboxing of the mouse is actually really impressive.  They use very high quality packaging.  Nice job.  I mean the packaging was so nice, I still have it all..(that's not normally for me.. I usually toss the box asap)\n* __Dual Modes:__ The mouse can be used both in cordless or corded modes.  That's a nice innovation and frankly I think all mice should adopt this.  Again.. Nice job guys.. I seriously like this and hope all mice do this in the future.. Quick! Patent it!\n* __5600 DPI:__ The mouse has a very high resolution so I'll throw this in as a plus but I never used it.. Frankly 5600 is way too high to be useful in my FPS games.. It's twitchy as hell..  I usually used one click up from default.. (not sure what that resolution actually is)\n\nYeah.. that's really it.. I'm trying to think of other nice things to say but I just can't think of anything..  I have used this mouse from day one as a wireless replacement for my G7 and I expected it to perform as such.. Boy was I wrong;\n\n* __Battery Life:__ Their packaging states clearly that this mouse has a battery life of approximately 14 hours of continuous gaming or 72 hours of normal gaming usage.  Horse shit!  I mean it doesn't even come remotely close to 72 hours of ANY kind of use.. 72 hours of sitting on the desk and it's dead..  it doesn't come close to 14 hours either..  If I get 8 hours of just \"work use\" I'd be happy..  14 hours of continuous gaming use?!  Bullshit..  This is just a marketing lie..  There is also only the one battery, and the only way to charge it is to put the mouse on the stand.   Fail.The G7 comes with two batteries, and you charge them via a charging station thats plugged into a USB port..  One G7 battery lasts a full day of constant gaming..  I would have to change the battery every day, but it takes a second to eject the old, and insert the new and have the old one fully charged again in no time.   Win.\n* __Sleepy Mouse__:  I have never had a mouse go to sleep as often nor as quickly as this one does.  If you stop using it for 30 seconds (or less sometims), it goes to sleep.   It then takes up to 30 seconds for it to recover, IF IT RECOVERS AT ALL!So you get up to go to the restroom.. Yeah mouse goes to sleep..  Getting a quick drink from the kitchen?  Yeah sleep mode..Most of the time when the mouse came out of its self imposed torpor the buttons would work but the laser optic wouldn't -- so you couldn't move the cursor.   I would be forced to turn the mouse off via the switch on the bottom, then turn it back on and hope it woke up.  Sometimes it would.. sometimes it wouldn't..  Fail.This was an extremely common occurance too, it really made me wonder if I had a broken mouse..The G7 never sleeps.. or if it is sleeping it wakes up the absolute instant you move it.. Win.\n* __Responsiveness:__ Their claim to fame on the box is that the Mamba has a 1ms response time!!!  Further stating that other mice have 2ms and others have 8ms.. *gasp*Again.. Marketing shit.  Frankly the response times of this mouse mean nothing..   I am not sure exactly how long it takes my eyes to observe a targer, decide to react, tell my hand to move and my finger to click, and my muscles to actually perform that action..  but I'm pretty sure the difference of 1 or 2 milliseconds wont make a difference.More over, due to internet latency all that speedy mouse shit is completely lost in the noise of the intertubes..Further more, due to the sleep issue from above and the fact that it would take up to 30 seconds to recover half the time the mouse seemed incredibly unresponsive..  Epic Fail.Again, the G7 which might be one of those \"other\" mice and have a 8ms poll .. Bit it always performs perfectly.  And using it I still come in first on CoD Multiplayer more times than not.  Win.\n\n\n__Mouse Suicide!__\n\nI can go on.. The form factor took me a little getting used to but it wasn't bad..  The clicks sound good and feel good, and the mouse wheel is okay if a little \"mushy\".. (personal preference)  But its performance as a mouse left me wanting..  A lot.. And often..  The simple fact is the Mamba is extremely unreliable and quirky.. It may work fine as a corded mouse, but as a cordless it's almost worthless..\n\nOn one of the forums I visit they suggested I update the firmware of the mouse to see if that helps..  So I did:  <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">At which point my Mamba committed suicide.</span>\n\nYeah not kidding.  (Firstly; why the hell does my mouse have a firmware?!  It's a mouse!! )  I installed their firmware update software, followed their instructions to the letter.. And for my trouble got a paper weight.   The firmware updater erased the mouses brain completely, started its bootloader process then stopped working..  Now it doesn't even work as a mouse and nothing I do will fix it..  The best part is, there is no hardware reset.\n\nSeriously?! I mean I thought it was telling before that I was forced to leave my broken G7 on my desk for when the Mamba decided to go off into the weeds, but now its completely shit the bed and I'm forced to use the G7 entirely..\n\nI can't tell you how unhappy this makes me.. I'm so entirely and completely dissatisfied with this piece of hardware.. I'm seriously considering boxing it up and just sending it back to them with a letter to their president..  If this is the quality of their hardware, I will never ever buy a Razer product again.. Ever..  More over I will tell people of my experiences with it.. Ala this blog post, my forums and others..\n\nAt this point as my last ditch effort I have created a ticket with their technical support in the hopes that I get some help, but I'm willing to bet I wont get a response.   I also plan to call them tomorrow and see if I can get this straightened out.. I'm sure there is some way to reset the darn thing and I just don't know how..   But again my hopes aren't high..  I also seriously doubt the firmware update will fix the other issues this mouse seems to be plagued with..\n\nI really wish I could write this as a personal letter to Robert \"Razerguy\" Krakoff..  He's the president and co-founder of Razer and I'm pretty sure he wouldn't make excuses for the experiences I have had..  So.. Mr. Krakoff, this is to you..\n\nYour company  missed the mark by a mile on this one..  Now lets see what your customer service department does..  This can still be a complete win for your company if you do the right thing here..  Good customer service can still save my opinion of you, but at this point I'm frustrated with the Mamba to the point of not wanting it any more..\n\nI'll keep ya'll posted.\n\n__Day 2 -- Razer Phone Technical Support -- (888) 697-2037__\n\nRazer email support did reply within the 24 hour period.. The response seemed somewhat canned but did ask relevant questions so it was just a way to start the ball rolling..  I wanted faster results so I decided to call..\n\nIt took me ages to find the damn phone number..   It isn't on their website at all.. I had to get it off a forum where someone else did a bunch of research to get it..\n\nBob answered the call and asked me my name... I told him and at the same time told him that I thought this mouse was a hunk of junk and it was also extremely frustrating and  hard to find a phone number for them..\n\nHe then mumbled \" 'ats by design \" prior to asking at normal volume; \"What phone number can you be reached at if we get disconnected..\"\n\nI stopped him and said \"Wait, did you just say thats by design?\"  He said \"no no I asked for a phone number to reach you at..\".. what a tool.. I'm not deaf..\n\nI'm using a stereo headset to make the call so I can hear you in both ears with perfect clarity..  I know what you said..   You should never say something like that to a customer, even if its true -- which apparently it is..\n\nBob seemed nice enough if maybe a little snarky.. But as a Razer T1 Support monkey, I could tell he was just browsing the web looking for solutions and was  out of his depth..\n\nAt one point he had me completely remove the drivers for it, then had me try to update the driver via the device control panel, to the driver installer.. Not the driver itself, but to the installer..   I told him that this wouldn't work and why --  he seemed completely confused and put me on hold..\n\nI got put on hold 3 times over the course of the call, each hold period got progressively longer while he researched solutions.. (read the internet, or went to ask someone..etc..  I know how our support monkeys work..)\n\nLater in the call I casually asked \"So do you guys get a lot of support calls?\"  He said \"No not really.. \"  I said, \"Thats cause the phone number is so hard to find.. thats by design right?\" to which he stated.. \"Thats right! Its what we hope for...\"\n\n... Sure.. why bother supporting your products...  I can't believe you admitted that..  Saying things like that to a customer can get you fired..\n\nBob of T1 support knew nothing about this product or how to support it other than what he could read.. After 35 minutes on the phone with him he admitted that \"he might actually have to escalate this call to T2\"..  Stressing the word actually, as if he was shocked.. I wasn't..\n\nIn my own testing of the product prior to calling I did more trouble shooting and research than he did ..\n\nAt 42 minutes he came back and asked \"Does the mouse light up?\"  .. No it doesn't.. The lights stopped working the instant the bootloader firmware update failed.. I'm pretty sure I mentioned that early in the call, but maybe not.. I was thinking it if nothing else..\n\nTo which he said; \"Okay we are done.. we have to get you a new mouse!\"  I'm thinking, Yeah.. I knew this yesterday.. I certainly knew it 45 minutes ago..\n\nSo now I'm supposed to wait for RMA notice in the email..\n\n__Day 2 + 45 minutes -- Razer Email Technical Support -- RMA'ing this thing__\n\nSo I got the email pretty much as soon as I hung up the phone..  I have filled it out and returned it..  One thing they wanted was proof of purchase.. well.. I have the thing don't I?  I have all the packaging too..\n\nI stated on the phone that I didn't have that so I'm going to assume for the time being that it will be okay..\n\nSo far I'm not blown away by customer support here..  It was painful to find and the person I found wasn't all that helpful..\n\nLets see if they will RMA it without proof of purchase..\n\n__Day 2 + 3 hours -- Razer RMA Process__\n\nFail.  It appears they are refusing to RMA this defective piece of crap without proof of purchase.   I have the product in its full packaging, with the Fry's Electronics label on the front.. but I don't have a receipt thus they are saying:\n\n* They can't verify that the product was purchased from an authorized seller of Razer products.\n* Can't verify that it wasn't previously \"used\", it isn't \"counterfeit\", and not \"gray market goods\".\n* Can't verify that the product isn't \"defective\".\n* Can't verify that the unit is still within the warranty period.\n\nWow..\n\n1.  The product was purchased from Fry's Electronics in Austin Texas.  I still have the packaging, and at this point I have put the mouse back in the box entirely..  There is a label on the front that is the Fry's label.. I'm pretty sure their authorized to sell Razer products cause they have a lot of it..  So this is a BS excuse.\n\n2.  I gave you the serial number of the product in the RMA request.  With that you should know if the product has been previously used, or if its counterfeit.. You should also know to which country the product was initially shipped..  Again.. BS.\n\n3.  I can 100% guarantee you the product is defective.. Your software made it so..  That's the whole point of this attempted RMA..\n\n4.  Your website states that the Razer Mamba has a warranty of 2 years.  Since it was unveiled to the world at CES in Jan of 2009, I'm pretty sure we are still win the warranty period..\n\nThis was a canned response letter and is very likely the first thing they do..   Deny first..\n\nNever mind that their product is BROKEN DUE TO THEIR SOFTWARE..  Yeah you heard me.. THEY BROKE IT.. Their update software killed my product, but its my fault and I'm just out the money and now the mouse..\n\nSo apparently the only thing I did wrong was to buy a Razer product..\n\nI could be coming away saying; \"Wow, I didn't really like the mouse but their customer support was excellent.. they treated me really well and took care of me.. I'd do business with them again..\"\n\nOr, I could be coming away saying; \"Wow.. what a bunch of asshats.. I will never ..ever.. ever.. buy from them again.. and now I'm going to tell everyone I know not to.. \"\n\nBased entirely on the experience I'm having, its clear to me they want me to do the second..\n\nMore as it happens..\n","previous":{"next":{"path":"_posts/2009-10-09-hardware-review-razer-mamba.md","url":"/hardware-review-razer-mamba/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-10-09-hardware-review-razer-mamba.md","id":"/hardware-review-razer-mamba","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Rants!","RandomStrings"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Hardware Review: Razer Mamba -- What a piece of shit!","layout":"post","tags":["Review"],"image":"/images/2009/10/razer-mamba-150x150.jpg","ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-10-09 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"hardware-review-razer-mamba","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2009-10-06-game-review-aion-online.md","output":null,"content":"<img title=\"Aion Online\" src=\"/images/2009/10/aion_wall_robe-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Aion Online\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" class='pull-right' />\n\nI have <a href=\"/past-mmos-i-have-played/\" target=\"_self\">played a lot of MMO's</a> in my time.. I feel I have a pretty good handle on the genre and have a very good idea of what makes a game good, and what makes a game bad.  Both in terms of what I personally feel, and as well as taking a broader view as a whole.  I can readily recognize why one game or another may not appeal to me, but be appealing to others.\n\nWhat's interesting is that I find that as time has gone on I have had to lower my expectations because none of contemporary games are ever as good as the now lofty memories of the games of old..\n\nI fully realize that it's not fair of me to compare a modern game to the memory of a previous game.  A memory full of good times, good people and fun events.  Memories that I generally cherish in some way, oh and there was a game involved too..\n\nAion Online is the first game in a long time that actually holds up under this scrutiny..  I was shocked..\n\nGenerally I use three games as my virtual yard sticks;  Ultima Online, because it was basically the first and implemented many things correctly, and many more incorrectly.  Everquest, again because it was ground breaking and a first but also because many of the things that made it most memorable are absolutely horrible by todays standards.  Ah memories.  And finally World of Warcraft because it's everything that Everquest wasn't -- including good in some cases.  I played all three of those games for at least more than 2 years.. Five in the case of EQ, and am still playing WoW as I type this though I can honestly say that I dread it at times..\n\nAion Online might find itself added to that yardstick for comparison to future games..\n\nInitially I was a bit horrified by the notion of a JRPG style game.. The very thought of a game in which the women were high pitch voiced busty school girls with bobbed hair and the men where androgynous she-males wielding swords you would otherwise need a forklift to move didn't exactly excite me.. Still doesn't to be honest, but that's not what Aion is..\n\nWhile I have seen a few extremely improbable swords the rest of the game isn't bad at all..   The JRPG aspect is fairly minor all things considered and the game itself is beautiful and full of depth.\n\nThe game itself isn't super innovative in that they really have only one thing that other games don't have and thats flight..  Their flight model is really great and does a lot for the game once you figure it out.  Flight has two modes;  Flying and Gliding.  When you glide, you have a chance of finding thermals and can soar just like a bird!   The only down side to flight is that no matter how you go about it you can only do it for so long bfeore you have to rest..\n\nEverything else is what you would expect, but done very well.. The game engine works well, if maybe a tad laggy from time to time and of course looks fantastic as it's based on the crysis engine..\n\nMy only true concern at this point is the end game.. It touts a brand new end game that they are calling PVPVE.. which is code for PVE while some one ganks you..  I'm not fooled..  But at the same time I havent' experienced it yet.. Maybe its good..\n\nI'll have to wait and see..\n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2009-10-03-delphi-like-idevcl-for-javascript-written-in-javascript.md","url":"/delphi-like-idevcl-for-javascript-written-in-javascript/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-10-03-delphi-like-idevcl-for-javascript-written-in-javascript.md","id":"/delphi-like-idevcl-for-javascript-written-in-javascript","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Software Development"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Delphi like IDE/VCL for Javascript, written in javascript","layout":"post","tags":["jQuery"],"image":null,"ribbon":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2009-10-03 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"delphi-like-idevcl-for-javascript-written-in-javascript","ext":".md"},"url":"/game-review-aion-online/","relative_path":"_posts/2009-10-06-game-review-aion-online.md","id":"/game-review-aion-online","collection":"posts","excerpt":"I have played a lot of MMO's in my time..
