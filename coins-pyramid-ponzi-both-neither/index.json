In fact, in the very beginning, you're willing to work with any client that comes your way, for any reason - you're not picky.  \n\nI mean consider it;  Clients are the magic element, the mana from heaven, the fuel, if you will, that makes your company go and grow.  They are your source of income, and as such are deemed important beyond measure.  You'd do anything they ask just to make them happy so they wont go away.  In fact, their happiness is often more important than yours, your employees, your families...  All in the name of making the company survive and thrive.\n\nSo the very notion of intentionally distancing yourself from a potential income source may seem like the absolute antithesis of what you're supposed to be doing!  But that's not always the case; Some clients need to go.  \n\nIf you really consider the drain that some clients put on your resources it becomes obvious that there are times that a client has to be given the boot, but it's not always easy to do.  Quite often you continue to put up with an unreasonable or unruly client and completely lose sight of the damage they are actually doing.\n\nThe simple fact of the matter is;  Any client that is an emotional, physical and mental blackhole is a cancer that must be cut away for the health of your company and the well-being of your employees.   It may seem counter intuitive but quite often the best way you can grow your company is to let go of them and move on.\n\nIt may not always be obvious though that a company should be fired.  Especially when you're inside, looking out.\n\n\n#### The first piece of advice here is to listen to the people around you; Especially your spouses.\n\nNo one knows you better than the people closest to you, and if they start seeing changes in your behavior and demeanor they are likely letting you know about it.  If a client is a nightmare and needs to be fired, then they are affecting your home life whether you realize it or not.  The people around you do notice. \n\n_What to do:_  Listen to them.  No client is worth your home life.  Ask your spouse, your friends, your immediate family.. see if they notice somethings wrong.  if you ask they will most likely say something when they wouldn't have otherwise.  We all do what we do to make money SECOND, happiness comes first.  And if your family isn't happy, you wont be either.    \n\n\n#### Are they making completely unreasonable demands?\n\nIn the beginning you're likely doing anything to make a client happy, to include things that might be unreasonable.  Unfortunately you're not doing yourself any favor because you're only training them that those demand they are making are okay.  And once a client is trained to behave a certain way, that will dominate the rest of your relationship with them.\n\n_How do avoid this:_  Set ground rules from day one.  Boundaries are a good thing.  Don't let a client walk all over you.  This may seem easier said that done, but in the end a client will respect you more and be more in-tune with your needs and you with theirs if you maintain a professional and reasonable relationship.   \n\nTalk to them and explain why a demand might be a bit over the top or out of line.  They are people too, they'll listen.  If they don't, then you know what needs to be done.  Most clients will tolerate a certain amount of \"adjustments\" to their line of thinking.  In the end of they don't then they aren't a good fit for you or your company.  Let them go.  There will be more clients.\n\n\n#### Are they asking you to hit a moving target?\n\nI can't tell you the number of times a client has come to me asking for a feature or enhancement only to change their mind or redefine that feature numerous times before, during and after launch.  See the section above on unreasonable demands. This kind of behavior is painful at best, and at worst will cause your employees to throw up their hands and quit.  \n\n_How to avoid this:_  Get a hard requirements document for each version of the product and stick to it.  Iterative development is fine and dandy but you can't program to a moving target.   Don't let a client do that to you.  They will complain, they will throw tantrums, they will have \"good reasons\", etc..  This sort of thing makes hitting deadlines impossible and quite often they will hold you to the original deadline with all the new changes they keep making.  Say no, but explain that we can get to their new goals at a future version or a later date.  \n\n\n#### Are they asking for everything for free?\n\nSome clients just don't understand how much time it takes to develop software.  In fact, many clients have these wonderful pie in the sky ideas that sound great, and think that just because they can dream it up, you can implement it for a song.    They don't get it and quite often never will.  \n\nIt's very easy to point at a plumber and the work he does and know exactly what you're being charged for.  The results are physical, but with software a lot of the time clients see what we do is an arcane magic performed over a cauldron, a bone in our nose with a chicken foot in one hand and some beads in the other.  They don't get it at all and no amount of explaining will bring them any closer to understanding.  You might as well be speaking a different language -- and you are.   \n\n_So now what?_  Give then your rate.  Tell them how many hours something will take before you get started and see if they balk.  It's always a good idea to map out a plan of attack based on the design document they gave you.  Give them a 10,000' estimate of work with a price tag attached.  Make it an HOURLY rate.  Don't do flat rate work, you'll always end up doing way more work than you should when someone hands you a large lump sum versus paying as they go.   Don't fall into that trap.\n\nAlso keep in mind a good plumber charges over $200 an hour for the work they do, yet many clients will scoff at $100 an hour for work that is infinitely more technical and skill laden.  Don't lower your rate to something that isn't sustainable.  You can always lower your rate later for a client if they are good people and you enjoy the work, but you will never get away with raising it for a client.  They wont let that happen.\n\n\n#### They make big promises but are slow to pay and come through?\n\nSome clients will promise percentages and large payouts, or contract with you to do work for an hourly rate and just never pay or be extremely slow to pay.  They may be good people and may actually have the intent to pay you as they say, but don't.\n\n_So now what?_  Firstly, get everything in writing.  This is your only legal recourse should it come to that.  \nSecondly, never work for a percentage of a company unless you really believe in the product and want to be a part of it.  Most of the \"killer ideas\" that people have, never pan out.  To quote Jayne Cobb; \"Ten percent of nothin' is, let me do the math here... nothin' and a nothin', carry the nothin'... \"  Always ask for some cash for the work you do -- even if that means you take a smaller percentage of the eventual pie.  You can't spend %%%, but $$$ will buy dinner.  \n\nFigure out what your minimum hourly rate is and don't ever go under it, not for any client, friend or sibling.  You have bills to pay, don't short change yourself. \n\nIn the end if you're a month in and they still haven't paid, stop working and have a conversation with them.  Make them understand you can't work for free, and no one should expect you to. \n\n\n#### They don't listen to you?\n\nSome clients know everything.  They have made software before so they know all the answers already and they don't need your opinion, they just want you to do the work that they have assigned you.  Most of these folks look at you as if you were a day laborer and you should just shut up and be thankful that they have hired you.  \n\n_How to avoid this:_  They hired you because they don't know how to do the work they hired you for, or they would do it.  They need to be reminded of that.  The advice you bring to the table should be seen as valuable or why are you even there?  There are various off-shore/near-shore entities they could have hired to do mechanical turk like work .. that's not you.  Don't let them do this.\n\nIf a client refuses to listen, even if they are paying well, it can cause you a lot of pain and frustration that just isn't worth the ulcer.  Move on.  \n\n\n#### Unprofessional tantrum throwing client that makes none-too-subtle threats?\n\n_Just fire them!_  The sooner the better.  They wont change their tune, this is another learned behavior that once it is set.. it's set. It wont \"get better\".  \n\nIf a client calls you names, curses at you, makes unjustified accusations, questions your ethics, or in anyway acts unprofessionally like this;  Just move on.  Don't look back.  This may seem obvious and to most it is, but it's a hard thing to do when you're trying to do right by a client and they just find nothing but flaws where there are none.  You can't make everyone happy.  Some people will only focus on the bad and be angry all the time.  Just walk away from them.  Some people aren't worth your time and the sooner you recognize that the better off you will be.\n \nThese kinds of clients are the worst and are the actual \"cancer\" clients I referred to above.  They will kill you, your company, your family.. etc.  They aren't worth the heart ache, the angst, the frustration, the sleepless nights, the pain; and you will suffer all of those and more with these guys.  Just move on.  Be tactful about it, but get out as soon as you can and never look back.  \n\n\n### You have a skill set!  You will be okay!\n\nDon't be afraid to fire a client.  It's a very liberating and can be a cathartic exercise.  Sometimes it just needs to happen and in my experience, it's never been a bad thing.  You have a skill.  Firing a client wont remove that skill.  You'll be okay. \n","previous":{"path":"_posts/2014-09-11-learning-to-fly.md","url":"/learning-to-fly/","relative_path":"_posts/2014-09-11-learning-to-fly.md","id":"/learning-to-fly","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Aviation","Hobbies"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"Learning to fly!","layout":"post","tags":["General Aviation"],"image":"/images/2014/09/N84086.jpg","gallery":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"tile_class":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2014-09-11 00:00:00 -0400","slug":"learning-to-fly","ext":".md"},"url":"/sometimes-you-just-have-to-fire-a-client/","relative_path":"_posts/2015-01-08-sometimes-you-just-have-to-fire-a-client.md","id":"/sometimes-you-just-have-to-fire-a-client","collection":"posts","excerpt":"Most people don't really think of clients as \"fireable\", including clients themselves...

As more coins are mined the value of the coins you have go down due to supply and demand, and in the case of those coins with no upper limit your coins could become worthless over time just due to the flood of coins on the market, though that would take a long time due to the difficulty increases imposed on mining over time.\n\nIn many ways, coins are more like the stock market than a pyramid, if I buy coins (which I have ZERO intention of doing btw) I'm increasing the value of the coin, just like the stock market.  Google stock was $85 back when it was new, now its $1220.  It's worth that much because people valued the company enough to buy the stock making the stock hard to get, causing the stock value to go up.. supply and demand 101.\n\nWith coins however there is this added injection of units through mining where as with stock typically the only way for more stock to come into being is through stock splits or secondary offerings.\n\nThe primary difference is in the backing and I see the sticking point that a lot of poeple have trouble with;  Most argue that google stock is backed up by a company, where as coins are backed up by the hopes, dreams, and wishes of the neckbeards and fedoras who think they are the smartest people in the room. And not much else.\n\nThey have no intrinsic value unlike pelts, skins, beads and shells of yesteryear or the modern currencies backed up by whole nations. They are valuable entirely because people say they are. \n\nThe question is, is that enough?  I dunno.  I'm skeptical.  I think it's likely not over the long haul, but I have been wrong before.\n\nIf you read some of the manifesto's around about the various alt-coins I truly believe that the intent is good and righteous.  But we are still talking about the mark 1 human being and as such people will find a way to abuse and seek personal gain just out of pure greed.\n\nAnd that's the issue.  That's where the pump and dump ponzi aspect rears it's ugly head.\n\nThis is a currency that lends it self to being abused easily because it's entirely computer based and a complete mystery to most people. You're not paying any of the original investors like a ponzi or pyramid, and yes your pie is getting bigger at the same rate as theirs if you're mining but the potential for abuse and misuse is massive.\n\nThe stellar lack of understanding lends it self to criminal behavior; In many ways I liken it to the stock market, the rich who are in the know will invest wisely and make a lot of money, where as the people who don't know will get bilked out of their hard earned cash simply because they don't know what to do and what not to do.  And unlike the stock market, there is a complete lack of government oversight and regulations and a lack of physical assets -- not even paper in the case of some stock.\n\nThis is why I do believe it's a ponzi on some levels, or rather it lends itself to being a ponzi because people can use it as a mechanism to lure the unwary and make personal gains from other peoples losses.  It is not a ponzi in and of itself, but it can easily be used as one by even the youngest hipster script kiddie.  \n\nIn many ways the whole thing reminds me of the early US when every state, province, town and bank had it's own currency and they were struggling to figure it out.  The difference being, unlike those early currencies there is absolutely no safety net.  No real hard \"thing\" to back up the value of the various currencies.\n\nIt's an interesting time.  And I think so long as you mine without investing any really money in it, no loss..  My computer was on crunching numbers anyway for Seti or World Community Grid..  Really they are the ones losing out.","previous":{"path":"_posts/2014-01-03-i-want-to-soar.md","url":"/i-want-to-soar/","relative_path":"_posts/2014-01-03-i-want-to-soar.md","id":"/i-want-to-soar","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Aviation","Hobbies"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"I want to go soaring","layout":"post","tags":["Soaring"],"image":"/images/2014/01/glider-on-ground.jpg","gallery":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"tile_class":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2014-01-03 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"i-want-to-soar","ext":".md"},"url":"/coins-pyramid-ponzi-both-neither/","relative_path":"_posts/2014-03-10-coins-pyramid-ponzi-both-neither.md","id":"/coins-pyramid-ponzi-both-neither","collection":"posts","excerpt":"I have been pondering this at length -- Is bitcoin (or any of the alt-coins) a ponzi or pyramid scheme?

That dream still holds true and I have begun the process.  But my plans might be changing.\n\nI still want to get a DA42, or a Cirrus SR22 or even a Cessna 400 but the simple fact of the matter is they are amazingly, stunningly and astronomically expensive.   Even so, I still started the process of getting my pilots license.  I have taken a couple lessons since then looking for a good instructor, got my 3rd class medical that is required for aviation and outfitted myself with all the accoutrements I would need to make it happen.   It's still a very real possibility.\n\nBut then I started to really think about what I would use it for.  The \"Mission\" as most GA pilots refer to it.  My initial goal was to get an airplane for the occasional flights back and forth to Texas from Georgia.  And that with an airplane of my own I could make that trip more often.  This is completely unrealistic.\n\nI, like most people, hate commercial airlines, but I can buy a round trip ticket to Texas for under $300 right now.  Sure there is the discomfort of the commercial aircraft, the crowds, the airport hassle, the delays, the TSA..etc.. but at that price point, I simply can't warrant getting my own aircraft.  Unfortunately, it would cost me more than that to put fuel in it for the trip to Texas -- one way.   Add to that airplane costs, maintenance, hangar space, licensing..etc.. and it just doesn't make sense at all.\n\nThis was a real downer to ponder by the way.  Everyone knows it's expensive, but now I can actually put real numbers to it.  Wow.  The plane alone that I would need to get in order to realistically do this mission in a timely manner would cost me over $350k -- used.  Not counting fuel and all the other monthly/yearly expenses.  Sure I could get a plane that costs a lot less, but it's still cost prohibitive.\n\nThis really was a pretty harsh dashing of my flying dreams.  Not that I can't do it, or even that I couldn't afford it.  I could actually, but it doesn't make sense.  It was expensive enough to trip my financial warning meter.\n\nEnter Soaring.\n\nA couple weeks ago I got to go gliding/soaring at the Chilhowee Gliderport in TN and had a blast.  I posted a video of it on youtube: [Gliding at Chilhowee](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvnCj-zZlpc)\n\nSuddenly a whole new option opened up;  Gliding!\n\nFirstly, it's safe.  Most folks don't understand how safe it actually is and are under the mistaken impression that the lack of an engine means it's some how dangerous.  Couldn't be further from the truth.  There are dangers involved of course, but it's not any more dangerous than flying a plane, riding a motorcycle, driving a car... walking.  Etc.\n\nSecondly, it's cheap!  Everything about soaring is a lot cheaper than powered general aviation.  Stunningly so.  It costs maybe $2k to get your glider pilots license versus closer to $10k for powered flight (or higher if you're using a \"pilot factory\" school like the ones Cessna puts on)\n\nAnd then there's the cost of aircraft ... Wow! So much cheaper!  A top of the line multiperson glider with all the bells and whistles is something like $300k to $400k.  And I mean that's the end of the price range.. that's the top dog.  A $300k to $400k powered aircraft is excellent to be sure, but it's no where near top dog.\n\nFinally, it's a more realistic mission.  To have fun.\n\nI can suffer commercial to fly back and forth to Texas when I need to go (going this January), but to have fun in the sky I can use a glider.  I knew that I wanted to fly just for the joy of flying once I had gotten my GA license, but the cost would make that a lot less fun.   Well gliders are so much cheaper you can do it for virtually nothing if you rent.   You can easily rent a nice glider, tow to altitude and fly around all day for under $200.  Awesome.\n\n","previous":{"next":{"path":"_posts/2014-01-03-i-want-to-soar.md","url":"/i-want-to-soar/","relative_path":"_posts/2014-01-03-i-want-to-soar.md","id":"/i-want-to-soar","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Aviation","Hobbies"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"I want to go soaring","layout":"post","tags":["Soaring"],"image":"/images/2014/01/glider-on-ground.jpg","gallery":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"tile_class":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2014-01-03 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"i-want-to-soar","ext":".md"},"path":"_posts/2013-12-30-oculus-rift.md","output":null,"content":"The Oculus Rift is an up and coming virtual reality head-mounted display being developed by Oculus VR, who as of this writing has raised over $90MM US dollars to fund this hardware wet dream.\n\nFor Christmas my business partner and I decided to go ahead and splurge on a couple of the developer kit versions of the OR because we have some development ideas that we want to explore.\n\nBut of course we also wanted them just to play with them and check them out.  Holy crap.  It's awesome.  Not perfect by any stretch of the meaning, but as developer kits go it's impressive as hell.  Once the final consumer version comes out, you should get one.\n\nThe developers kit is very nice and extremely professionally produced.  The Rift unit itself seems pretty solid and works well once you get used to it (more on that in a minute).\n\nWhat amazes me about it is how good the accelerometers are.  The head tracking system is perfect.  I expected it to be kinda crappy to be honest, or lag a little when you turned your head but it really isn't.  Accelerometer technology has come a long way and the precision there is excellent.\n\nThe unit itself isn't heavy and in fact I stopped noticing it after the first 5 minutes.\n\nThe cost of the unit itself is $300 for the developer kit and they are guessing the final version will be between $300 and $400.  I think this is completely reasonable as it's essentially just another monitor.  How much did you pay for your nicest monitor?\n\nAs for the bad -- this is all I can really think of;\n\n_*Developer Kit Resolution:*_ The developer kit is very very good, but its really low resolution.  The system works by putting a small flat screen (think cellphone) about 3 inches from your eyes and putting two images on that single screen that you look at through lenses.   The picture as you have probably seen is just a fisheye view of whatever the game or software is displaying split in two and slightly offset to give you the left/right eye.  Clever.   But the dev kit has a 1280x800 resolution.  That means its effectively 640x800 per eye.  That's pretty poor.   The image itself while amazingly responsive and the over all performance of the unit is good, the image looks kind of like an image made with lego blocks a couple feet away.\n\nThe good news is they are working on the Resolution and the final version will be a lot higher.  So for a developer cheap version, this is awesome.\n\n_*Positional Tracking:*_ As I said in the review above the orientation tracking is amazing.  The unit itself has a gyroscope/accelerometer system that makes unit orientation spot on.  I was very happy with this, they did a fantastic job here.  But it has no positional tracking what so ever and likely wont ever have that without another piece of hardware.\n\nFor those familiar with the Track IR piece of hardware it gets around positional tracking by forcing you to put something on your head in order to get position in space, without that I'm not sure how good positional tracking could be.\n\nBut I hesitated to put this here as I dont know that it needs positional tracking.  I imagine there will be some pieces of software that could benefit from it, but for the most part I don't know that it's needed.\n\n_*Motion Sickness:*_ I NEVER get motion sick.  Never.  Not at all. .... or at least not until I used the Oculus Rift for 20 minutes.  This says a lot to me.  I know my wife and my best friend get motion sick if you show them a first person shooter for a minute or two.  I don't.   In fact one of my favorite games of all time was <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descent_(video_game)\" target=\"_blank\">Descent</a> a true 360 degree first person shooting game.  This is a game that was known for (and eternally banned for) making my buddy nearly projectile vomit. heh  Loved it.\n\nAnyway, the rift made me feel very queasy.  Stunned me actually.  But after 3 sessions of 20 minutes or so, I was able to play for an hour before it started to hit me.  So it's clear to me that this is something you just have to get used to.. But be warned.  I know some people that once they get motion sick are down for hours.\n\nMy only other suggestion or wish (aside from the higher resolution thing which is already coming) would be to have a slightly wider field a view.  I want it to wrap around more.\n\nBut seriously those are really minor complaints all things considered =)  If you're any kind of gamer at all, once the consumer version comes out.. get it.. You'll be glad you did.","previous":{"path":"_posts/2013-12-10-state-of-industry.md","url":"/state-of-industry/","relative_path":"_posts/2013-12-10-state-of-industry.md","id":"/state-of-industry","collection":"posts","draft":false,"categories":["Software Development"],"published":true,"type":"post","title":"State of the Industry Concerns","layout":"post","tags":[],"image":"/images/2013/12/cliff.jpg","gallery":null,"ribbon":null,"tile_size":"1x1","tile_color":null,"tile_class":null,"private":false,"allow_comments":true,"date":"2013-12-10 00:00:00 -0500","slug":"state-of-industry","ext":".md"},"url":"/oculus-rift/","relative_path":"_posts/2013-12-30-oculus-rift.md","id":"/oculus-rift","collection":"posts","excerpt":"After my first 48 hours with the Oculus Rift;  Holy crap.
